Some interesting MU Glassdoor reviews,"Disclaimer: obviously these are some cherry-picked negative reviews from hundreds of otherwise positive ones.

[https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Micron-Technology-RVW23588924.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Micron-Technology-RVW23588924.htm)

&gt;With new CEO, company turn over has increased hugely, and don't be too  excited if you get an offer these days, as many kids are leaving. Ask  for big pay, they  have no choice, possibly they will accommodate you.  
**The new CEO has also came up with 7% layoff each year.** If your manager  wants to get rid of you, she/he will give you a low score, bing, you  will need to go. Remember that there are no other opportunities in Boise  other than Micron. For this reason, think really twice when you wana  move to Idaho.

[https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Micron-Technology-RVW23649440.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Micron-Technology-RVW23649440.htm)

&gt;Offering a severance package to people who got 2s on the performance  review of 2018 was absurd. It was one thing to implement a reduced  profit sharing %, but pushing hundreds of honest, dedicated, and skilled  employees out the door for no reason went way to far. **Do not repeat  this in 2019 or you will likely lose the rest of your knowledgeable  workers in DRAM Product Engineering: whom are already slim-pickings as  is.**

[https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Micron-Technology-RVW23468428.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Micron-Technology-RVW23468428.htm)

&gt;Pros  
&gt;  
&gt;I've  been at Micron for over 17 years. I've worked at several other  companies prior to Micron. Every company has there good and bad, and,  mostly I think Micron is good. Micron is a very diverse company, family  oriented, with very decent benefits.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cons  
&gt;  
&gt;The  new CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, has done some good, but, unfortunately the  new system of forced bell curve ranking has changed my views of Micron.  The last couple of years Micron has done very well and this year the  bonus was probably the best I've ever seen. **Yet, the recent layoffs  using the forced bell curve ranking system have overshadowed the  happiness that one should feel with Micron's success.**  
&gt;  
&gt;I've seen   and heard of terrible stories of good people getting low scores. Some  of the scores were based on lies to help justify the low scores to  remove individuals. Some stories of managers leaving Micron because they  were being forced to give a low score when the individual didn't  deserve it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Micron has had layoffs before and usually there is  good justification for it. This last layoff, I have yet to understand  the justification for it. Financially, this is the best that Micron has  ever done. Sure, there are poor performers, they should be handled  individually and appropriately.  
&gt;  
&gt;Micron use of the forced bell  curve ranking really doesn't make sense. It uses fear to increase  performance, colleagues are now competing in the hope of keeping a high  score and the collaboration goes down. You job is in question every  year. If you do a google search for ""bell curve forced ranking"", you  will find several articles stating that this method is outdated and  doesn't increase performance and should not be used.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is for  this reason I have hard time referring and recommending Micron to  others. I really hope Micron re-evaluates this method.  
&gt;  
&gt;Advice to Management  
&gt;  
&gt;Ditch the forced bell curve ranking system. There are better ways to motivate and increase performance.

Two ways to view this:

\- New management is getting rid of dead weight to reduce costs and better handle downturns

\- New management is clueless and applying a Netflix-style fire and hire strategy to a domain where experience and expertise are much more valuable and hard to find than in web development",gkdjsl,1546192048,1,24,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aaxy0j/some_interesting_mu_glassdoor_reviews/

Short $SNAP,"$SNAP is a complete shitshow. They’ve been unable to successfully monetize the platform and continue to lose money on Spectacles. 

The 3rd gen Spectacles are priced at $350 lmao! There’s no way they can find enough idiots to buy them at that price and the company is going to continue to lose money on the hardware. And management is completely retarded. 
[SNAP obsessed with losing money on hardware ](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/24/snaps-former-cfo-left-because-of-evan-spiegels-fix.aspx)

DD 12/28: what the option mkt is saying &amp; other remarks,"Most likely scenario at EOD: We pin at 250 SPY

Otherwise, i expect a bounce at the ovn low at close to 2483 as main trajectory.

if we loose the ovn low we can be saved by either the Straddles at 243.98 and if all else fails 2410 will hold thanks to 1Bn in 243 puts

only way we go to 260 is if we managed to hover above the straddle implied move at 252.16 after which a gamma explosion should kick in like in Wednesday.

Of note is the bearish divergence between what SPY is doing and Bonds, VIX, Fx are up to. they are in 1 camp and equities are alone in one spot, who will be right? i think all in all rest will win.

$EBAY short DD,"I got something for you degenerates.
I don’t know much about finance (like everyone on this sub) but I have some good Ebay DD since I’m a big seller on this website (1000+ reviews, $100,000 a year) Since august, around 10-15 times a month, some sales are made by someone who hacked the ebay account ( and since the payment went through, I assume paypal too) I keep getting the notification “Unauthorized use of buyer account” because ebay is being hacked and hackers have access to hundreds of accounts and are buying a lot of things with them (then sometimes asking by ebay message to change the location of the shipping to another address, usually a PO box) 
So I don’t know if this data breach is gonna be exposed to the public or not, or when it’s gonna be exposed but I would buy long term puts on this piece of shit. 
Also I hate everything about ebay as a seller, the platform is shit, their support is shit and the community is full of shitty scammers.

Short Thesis: GoDaddy (GDDY) / Due Diligence Inside,"Hey everyone, I wanted to provide my quick thoughts on an interesting short idea that I've implemented for GoDaddy.

TLDR:

GDDY is a flaming pile of debt-riddled garbage and won't be able to survive the recession. **I'm shorting the company via JAN 15 2021 P contracts**. Wall street analysts got this one wrong - GDDY is not like the FANGs. Citi has a ""buy"" rating on the stock and GS has a PT of $81/share, which I believe is insane. Give it 2 years and this company will have a lower stock price than the current stock price.

**Why I'm Shorting GDDY**

First, I want to clarify how I execute equity analysis. It's my opinion that technical analysis (aka charting, aka T&amp;A) is only relevant in the short-term (less than one month - yes I know that's literally an eternity for people here), and the predictability of technical analysis decreases drastically as one increase the time horizon for the investment. So, I will be justifying my short position in GoDaddy with **fundamental analysis.** In the long-run, the fundamentals of a company will determine its future value, and therefore its share price. This is because regardless of technical patterns, stocks inevitably must revert to their ""fair value"" eventually.

So, what are the fundamental indicators that convince me to short the company? Here's some quick data benchmarked against the medians for the global internet information industry.

&amp;#x200B;

|Indicator|GoDaddy (GDDY)|Industry Median|
|:-|:-|:-|
|P/E|82.65|26.90|
|Interest Coverage Ratio|1.34|241.39|
|Debt-to-Equity Ratio|3.48|0.27|

&amp;#x200B;

One of these indicators isn't enough to convince any investor to short a stock. But, taken together, this is 3 GIANT red flags for GDDY. 

***P/E:***

P/E is ridiculously high and unjustified compared to the median. This company is not on fire with brand new innovations, and their services are highly commoditized. This compresses their margins in the long-run. More below on QoQ revenue.

***Interest Coverage Ratio / Debt to Equity:***

So we're all on the same page, interest coverage ratio is ""the number of times a company can pay its interest expense out of EBIT"". If you don't know what EBIT is, it's just ""Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses"", also known as ""operating income"". It's the earnings of a company before it pays (debt) interest expenses and taxes. 

So, the 1.34 number is telling us that GDDY is LITERALLY barely making payments on their debt. To use a simple analogy, this is like having a $5,000 income and a $4,800 monthly mortgage. If something bad happens like you lose your job and your income goes down, you'll foreclose on your house instantly. This is similar to GDDY going into Chapter 11 bankruptcy after the margins compress more or the top line gets fucked in a recession. Obviously bad for the share price.

This is highly related to the debt-to-equity ratio. This company is saddled with tons of debt, while the industry has a D/E ratio far below 1, let alone **fucking 3.5!**

**Quarterly Revenue Growth**

The company's QoQ revenue growth was most recently 2.91%, with historical QoQ growth being 13.91% just a year earlier. The median QoQ revenue growth for the past 6 quarters was 3.90%. This is not a company that is growing 20% a year like other Wall Street darling tech companies. It's already facing serious headwinds and a looming bear market is not going to be good for the top line.

**How I'm Shorting It: LEAPS**

My overall view on the market is generally negative. You can point to trade war tensions, interest rate hikes, slowing global growth, market bubbles, stock buyback programs, national debt, an inverting yield curve, or maybe even the homeless. I think we're reaching the end of one of the longest bull markets in modern history, and there are more things that will depress investor expectations than enhance them. 

We can debate macroeconomics all day, but ultimately I think by Jan 2021 we'll have started or will be in a recession. So, I'm buying the  JAN 15 47.50 P contracts. I'm up a few percent right now on the trade, but the stock really only has to go down 15% to make a solid return. At that point you can just set a stop loss at break even or take profits. The beauty of LEAPS is that you get the leverage of a derivate (x100 multiple) while also not getting fucked as many of us do by weeklies.

**Risks of Trade**

If GDDY gets acquired, this trade is fucked. Not much else to say here, merely a risk you have to be willing to take to execute this trade.

**Conclusion**

I think GoDaddy will be hurt especially hard by this upcoming bear market, because of their weak fundamentals. If their TTM revenue growth is negative already, imagine what it will be when you have every other company tightening their belts and looking for ways to cut expenses (namely GoDaddy's services).

If you disagree with my thesis I would be interested to hear your thoughts. Thanks!

Short $LRCX even further? Their CEO had to resign for ‘workplace misconduct’ and I found a glassdoor review claiming pattern sexual advancing at work,"[heres the review](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lam-Research-Reviews-E1582.htm)

I bought puts on $LRCX after hearing their CEO had to resign amid workplace misconduct alligations. They are already ITM quite a bit but I found somethig interesting. 
Little has been revealed about the nature of these allegations other than they are not finance related and comparisons to other semiconductor stocks that faced similar allegations recently. The link above has a glassdoor review titled “women be aware” which was published even before the ceo resigned. It claims the CEO was notorious for advancing upon women in the workplace.

Yes the stock has probably already moved some from the departing CEO but perhaps it can tank further if it is known that they are likely sexual allegations and it was likely a pattern occurance? After all, sexual misconduct from a CEO = settlement payout/s right? Anyone know how we can get articles written about this?
Anyways it seems like all of the conditions are right for a stock like this to slump the rest of the year. Semiconductor manufacturers have been poor all year, General market sentiment is clearly bearish this week, and now this specific evidence about sexual misconduct...

My puts are already ITM, im just wondering if anyone thinks we can hype what Ive found to publicize the info from the glassdoor review to the trading press?",TheMaskedGorditto,1545013468,1,13,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/a6vjkm/short_lrcx_even_further_their_ceo_had_to_resign/

Timing the Market and Trade War Theta,"  

So because of Tariff Man, we basically have a maturity date of a significant event we know should happen before March 1st.  [Deadline](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/09/lighthizer-90-day-pause-in-us-china-trade-war-is-a-hard-deadline.html)  

There should be a time decay related to this systematic event. For each day we get closer to that maturity date, the general market conditions should have a higher probability of decreasing due to theta, on average. 

Of course, if we get a trade deal, the market’s will jump. But I think the US and Chinese negotiators are working hard right now, no real incentive to give in too easily.  I don’t see them making a deal this weekend.

The 2018 Farm Bill and Industrial Hemp,"So I’m going to keep this short as I mentioned this on here before, but there is a lot of money to be made here, so I’ll give a quick synopsis. Basically in 2014 the farm bill legalized research growing of Hemp, which can be used for a shitton of things, most importantly CBD. Off this news the entire sector of US hemp (it’s small) shot in in value over 20x it’s usual resting price per share. Now, this new farm bill LEGALIZES HEMP AND CBD FEDERALLY. As such, the sector will likely go up at minimum 10x its current value... especially as it will allow institutions to legally invest in the sector. As such companies such as HEMP HMPQ CVSI and more will likely skyrocket once the bill is signed. On top of that, they have already picked up traction goin up an easy 10-30% daily (I have already doubled my money) so lads and ladies, let’s all become millionaires together.

**Copy/Pasted:**

Biopharma/Investing  
————————–  
GSK acquisition of TSRO is very value-destructive and weakens faith in new GSK management. For $5bn, a drug that is a 50/50 to reach $500 million is quite the price tag.

GBT is probably a better long “up here” than before. The risk of an approval is gone. Commercial risks remain with Novartis’ drug seemingly superior in efficacy. A combination study would be wise. The market is big enough for both, though. I see GBT trading over $100 sooner or later.

DEEP DIVE – CELGENE – PRICE TARGET: $91.00  
——————————————————–  
Revlimid (lenalidomide) is 2/3rds of Celgene’s revenue, with $10 billion in revenue expected for this year. The composition of matter patents on Revlimid expired (the IND for Revlimid was filed in 2000), as Revlimid is simply a derivative of Thalomid (thalidomide). We will spend some time on the indole-pyridine scaffold of thalidomide. While the structure of Revlimid is very similar to Thalomid, the drug does have some advantages over its predecessor. Nevertheless, nearly 30 patents which “protect” Revlimid will likely be found invalid or not infringed by would-be generic entrants. The first entrant, NatCo (partnered with Teva), has settled with Celgene for a partial distribution deal starting in 2022. The strongest patent is the ‘800 polymorph patent, expiring in 2027. NatCo is allowed a full launch in 2025, with their 2022 “low-single-digits” participation in Revlimid growing to one-third in that year. This would have been a fairly good deal for Celgene if no further ANDAs were filed. But when you have the world’s second best selling drug, you can count on competition. Dr. Reddy’s is at the plate as we speak, with expert discovery concluding in the near future and a trial likely for late 2019 or early 2020. More importantly, their 30-month stay will expire in late 2019. So, how strong is a polymorph patent? I initially felt that Celgene would have a very low likelihood of prevailing at trial, and their Natco settlement indicates weakness. Further research revealed polymorph patents do occasionally prevail, and I believe Celgene has a roughly 50-50 chance of having the patent upheld. The details of the ‘800 fight are beyond the scope of this review, but take a look at the docket and some case law in polymorph patents–many white papers are available. After Dr. Reddy’s, 5 more ANDAs have been filed: Zydus, Cipla, Lotus, Apotex and Sun are all waiting in the wings.  
Ultimately, there isn’t enough Revlimid to go around for Celgene and the generics. The Natco settlement worked for one company, and there is enough room for Dr. Reddy’s, but ultimately Celgene will not be able to settle every generic as each subsequent filer finds each subsequent settlement offer less attractive than a trial. Imagine being the fourth ANDA here–do you really want the 3.5% of Revlimid starting in 2024 and up to 2025 but nothing if the patent is overturned in the future? Someone will break ranks and go to trial and overturn what is probably a flimsy patent. So, I have 2019 revenue of Revlimid at $11.5b, 2020 at $12.7b and 2021 at 50% of that: $6.3b, 2022 at $3.5b. Someone launches in 2021 is my best guess. One year later adds roughly $10 per share, so risk is weighted to the upside (probably) here. The three remaining points on Revlimid are the success of generics, replacement by the IMID portfolio and recent data.  
Revlimid generics may not do so well, commercially, from the outset. Somewhat like the dynamics of a biosimilar, I predict that the first generic entrants for Revlimid may not find the marketplace too easy. Revlimid’s REMS program has a lot of mindshare with doctors and their assistants–switching to a Dr. Reddy’s program may not be facile and the near 100% generic switch rates we see with oral solids may not take place here. See Clozaril and Accutane for historical reference.  
Revlimid is still alive, with the AUGMENT data showing remarkable efficacy. AUGMENT is actually a bad thing, I think, for Celgene, as it takes the wind out of potential NHL data for avodomide and iberdomide, the two named “IMID” follow-ons. If I wanted to transition revenue to those drugs, I’d delineate and differentiate them from Revlimid. Instead, we see Revlimid is potent in r/R NHL with Rituxan. So, where do we go with iberdomide and showing how it is different from generic Revlimid? It may not matter as clinical data you can see is better than hypothetical differences, but if I had my druthers I’d have saved non-MM/MDS for the follow-ons. I have no revenue at all in my model for the next-generation IMIDs. Part of the reason for that is they share the indole/pyridine scaffold. They are the same-old structure of thalidomide, which is really disappointing. A direct cereblon modulator should be doable at this point, and even Novartis has created such molecules. Again, I’m being conservative, but perhaps for good reason.  
Pomalyst is also a thalidomide derivative and is relying on a polymorph patent. I have it going away in 2023. It is remarkable that practically the entire company is disappearing in a few years. The pharmaceutical world has never seen such a dramatic patent cliff combination in its history.  
Otezla is also a thalidomide derivative, with a sulfonamide decoration which makes it a PDE4 inhibitor. It also relies on a weak polymorph patent, and there are many ANDAs on file, just like thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide. I suspect generics will enter in 2023, if not sooner.  
Abraxane is going generic soon too. Like I said, the entire company disappears in a few years.

So, to counter the record large simultaneous patent cliffs, you have to build the world’s best pipeline, right? Celgene has tried their best, but nothing will replace the nearly $20 billion in peak sales that will be lost to generics. Ozanimod, luspatercept, lis-cel, BCMA CART, and fedratinib make my model and only reach about $6 billion in revenue for “the new Celgene”. This is still enough, as its growing and promising revenue that is conservatively forecast (could be $10 billion if everything goes right). But make no mistake, there is absolutely no way Celgene survives the patent cliff as we know it.  
Ozanimod is the tortured S1P acquired from Receptos. I have it peaking at $1.6B and this is my most conservative forecast. It is possible ozanimod does far, far better than this. There are some other S1Ps, with Novartis actually having beaten Celgene’s refiling of ozanimod with their next-generation of Gilenya (fingolimod), siponimod. Still, with $4 billion of Gilenya sales despite a toxicity profile that shocks the conscience, it is blue skies for the fumbling ozanimod. Assuming approval in 2020, they won’t have much time to replace very much of Revlimid, but they might be able to soften the blow if they execute well, which I suspect they will.  
I model $1.5B in net revenues from all BCMA CARTS (Juno and Bluebird). This might be conservative as well, but with the rapidly changing environment, it is hard to be confident of any CART revenue projections. Competition abounds from all fronts, CART and non-CART, so who knows if the numbers are accurate or not. Again, I tried to keep risk skewed to the upside. There are many that feel this paradigm shift will be a $5 billion+ opportunity for EVERY player. It is possible. The 80% response rates seen at ASH are remarkable for such late-stage patients. The 50-50 with Bluebird limits some revenue potential, however.  
I model $1.0B for luspatercept, net of Acceleron’s share. This drug isn’t a miracle as the ASH data shows. It is still very good, and will change the lives of many MDS patients. Where can you price it though? You’re trying to wean people off of RBC transfusions and there are other options potentially coming. Some feel this will be far larger than I think, but the XLRN stock price is perhaps telling us something different. My numbers could be conservative here as well.  
I only model $900m peak for lis-cel. I am a CART bear and I think drugs like MorphoSys’ will be seen as preferable. CART reminds me of Zevalin. You can squeeze out a tiny bit more performance relative to the mab, but is it worth it? Plus, you have Allogene and others making better CARTs. I’m just not ready to have $3B+ forecast for no reason. If Yescarta puts up a few more good quarters, perhaps a revision to $1.5B may be necessary. Again, conservative in most places, but I think I’m right on here.  
Fedratinib: I don’t get this one. I see $400 million peak sales in the Jakafi-dominated myelofibrosis/PV indications. This isn’t going to be a blockbuster.

Celgene still has a few years before “impact” and that is really important. With $25B or so of high-margin Revlimid revenue prior to expiry to deploy, and $40B or so if you count pre-full cliff of Rev+Pom+Otezla, there is plenty of capital to do a few more deals. They passed on Tesaro, which is a good start. Celgene has generally been pretty good at BD. The Acceleron deal is a good example (signed for $25 million if I recall correctly). The Juno deal makes me nervous that they’re feeling desperate, but there is still plenty of firepower for acquisitions. A few smart deals will not save Revlimid, but they don’t need to. We’ve all digseted the impact of the cliff and what is important is to value the copious cash flows between now and then, and value the “stub” remainder that the pipeline represents. It’s worth a lot, more than the current fear-based stock price of $71. If you believe my nervous nature was too conservative on all the pipeline, the stock is probably worth $100 or $110 or perhaps more if they can execute Revlimid flawlessly. With Revlimid lasting a bit longer than I think and just one drug like ozanimod surprising to the upside, you could get $120 or $130 out of the stock. For such a big company, that is an attractive return. However, a dud of an acquisition (Tesaros abound) or further buybacks make the risk profile uncomfortable. Celgene has a gun against their head and most management teams are not known for patience during shareholder pain.

The Impact of the arrest of Huawei CFO,"To watch tomorrow:

Apple and whose profit could be heavily impacted by Beijing's retaliation

&amp;#x200B;

This is a big fucking deal for Chinese business community and brings huge amount of uncertainty to US-China relationship. Huawei is a 'private' (not really) company of strategic significance to Beijing in terms of development of 5G and telecom infrastructure. So, kinda like ZTE. However, Huawei is bigger in size than ZTE, and much more important culturally. It's been the pride of Chinese business community. The arrested CFO, Meng Wanzhou, who is not only the daughter of Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei but also the grandchild of a prominent party member, is indeed a slap in Beijing's face. China domestic news outlets just reported the news, and Beijing will undoubtedly face immense domestic pressure to get her back. Also, she is supposed to take over Huawei CEO role from her father on Dec 31st 2018. Having Chinese business community's spiritual leader's de facto CEO arrested by the U.S. right after (or during) Trade negotiation is not exactly a show of friendliness. The timing of this arrest is just amazing. 

Of course, Beijing can let Huawei go the route ZTE went (bend the knee). But doing so would most definitely make Beijing appear 'weak' in front of domestic citizens, and that could spark further dissatisfaction, which is the last thing the party want now. In my opinion and from the Chinese (both in and outside of the states) I talked to since the news broke, Beijing can't afford to bend so quickly this time. This is just a start..

NVLN for likely short term gains due to discreet Sec filing after hours today with interesting attached letter,"This stock has some high Moon potential (but bios are always risky so invest responsibly)

Today (after hours) Healthcare Value Partners bought up a ton of stock in NVLN and almost doubled it's stock value instantly. HOWEVER, the interesting/unusual part was a attached letter (you can read yourself if you look up the filing)....

Healthcare Value Partners wrote in their letter to management that the fact that NVLN replaced their CEO with an interum attorney CEO, among other recent events, makes it look like a buyout is right around the corner. They evaluated the stock at around $34/share for a buyout. Right now it trades just under $2.

The news alone will likely pump this stock in premarket and for the next couple of days. It is also very likely a buyout is just over the horizon.

It could be some easy tendies short-term (or even long) since the news hasn't exploded yet. It's also unlikely to have any significant drop since 50% of it's value was bought up after hours just yesterday, so it's low risk as far as bios are considered.

Calling all degenerates who trade $SPY,"Without boring any of the autistic readers - look up @HFTAlert on twitter &amp; just scroll through some of his pics. I've been working on my own amateur-type excel sheet to decipher the $ flow &amp; potential price movement / MM pinning that, ultimately shows the inconsistencies in L2 &amp; even the Time &amp; Sales window. Maybe not inconsistencies but, the shit that you won't see &amp; wouldn't think twice about. I'll leave a link to the spreadsheet, but I intentionally left it with values of data only rather than with the formula I used. @MarktetSwingPlay is another to look at - actually the reason for this post because he just came out w/ a tweet mentioning the same ""Range"" my excel sheet showed for this past week. I'm not tryna sound confusing - but long story short, I take a 1Min chart of $SPY each day &amp; export OHLC price, money flow, &amp; volume straight from ETRADE; been doing this since early October. On a 1min chart @ the EOD looking back, there's volume that correlates (almost) perfectly to the amount of $ flow that goes into $SPY - using a HLCC price for each candle, the $ flow / volume (almost) perfectly amounts to either the actual closing price, or the HLCC price. Other times, there's inconsistencies like even this past week that, a ""Money price"" is either MUCH higher, or MUCH lower than where $SPY is trading for that day. It creates a range, &amp; a crystal ass clear cut price that a big buyer or a big seller is ready to act like a wall of resistance, or a trampoline of support. Using excel @ the EOD is dope &amp; all to have the idea ready for the next day &amp; all, but some mf's have whole ass platforms they coded or whatever themselves but like, if this is all there is to it then......... who's good at coding? I'll send the formulas to anyone that's interested in looking more into it but, yeah. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S - Low range &amp; High range were both filled this past week, with more than a few of low range inconsistencies that got targeted. $273.40 low vs. $275.45 high. The excel sheet shows which range is targeted, &amp; ultimately leads to a lower / higher ""target"". Unless a new range is found come monday, High target is $277.52 &amp; low target is $271.34. Selling program was caught @ $272.35 while price was @ $273.16 - so I was surprised @ the rally after seeing the selling pressure. Sheet 1 is a backup, sheet 2 is current. Start on Oct 12th (cell 782). There's data all the way through column ""U"" in case you have to scroll to see it.

Wrap it up bois,"US MARKET WRAP – 30 November 2018: Trump says something may come out of dinner with China’s Xi
  * SNAP-SHOT: Equities up, treasuries up, dollar up, crude down.
  * REAR-VIEW: G20 kicks off, with Trump optimistic ahead of Xi meeting; Chicago PMI at 11-month high; Canadian GDP misses.
  * NEXT WEEK: OPEC Meeting, RBA, BoC Rate Decision, Fed's Beige Book, ECJ to publish Article 50 opinion, Brexit vote debate begins in Commons, US &amp; Canadian Labour Market Report, Nikkei Mfg PMI, Japanese Mfg PMI, Chinese Caixin Mfg PMI, Eurozone Markit Mfg PMI (Final), US ISM &amp; Markit Mfg PMIs, US Vehicle Sales, Australian GDP, Chinese Caixin Services PMI, Eurozone &amp; US Markit &amp; Services PMIs, US ISM Non-Mfg PMIs.
   
  * G20: Reports out of the G20 suggest that China and US have found some points of agreement, and the areas of agreement are increasing, although China still sees some disagreements. Moreover, a Washington correspondent reported that a potential outcome for tomorrow would be both sides agreeing to continue talks and possibly the US even announcing to hold off on Jan 1 tariff increases to help discussions continue. The positive tone has contributed to some pockets of risk-on. Saturday’s meeting between US President Trump and China President Xi at the G20 Leader’s Summit in Buenos Aires (30/Nov-1/Dec) will set the tone for the next leg of the trade conflict between the two nations. In early comments on Friday, US President Trump stated there are some good signs on China trade adding “if we could make a deal it would be good” while US Trade Representative Lightizer said he would be surprised if Saturday's dinner between Trump and Chinese President Xi fails, adding that there will be good discussion on ""very serious issues"", and appeared confident there will be a ""positive feel"" for both parties. In terms of the news flow, the WSJ reported that the two nations are working towards a new trade framework, where China would first make concessions in the agriculture and energy sectors, in return for the US suspending tariffs, which will be hiked from 10% to 25% in January on around USD 185bln (after exemptions) of US imports of Chinese goods in January. Other news reports suggest that China economic advisor Liu He could visit Washington for talks. However, on the other side of the coin, US trade advisor and China hawk Peter Navarro, who was reportedly not going to be part of discussions at the G20 between Trump/Xi, will now be part of the mix, which analysts suggest could be a negative. If Trump and Xi cannot come to a détente, the path may be laid for Trump to once again threaten to impose tariffs on remaining Chinese imports into the US (approximately USD 260bln), which may see a further ramping up of tensions, weighing on global growth expectations further. However, analysts at Citi remain optimistic: “The bar seems low for a positive surprise. As a reminder, we expect a joint US-China statement and perhaps plans to continue negotiating but without providing a credible signal that trade tensions have peaked,” the bank says, adding “we don't think anything material comes out with any level of detail. The market probably takes this scenario positively on Monday open, but optimism might fade if no further details are forthcoming into the rest of the week.”
  * TRADE: US President Trump, Canada's PM Trudeau and Mexico's Pena Nieto have signed the USMCA trade agreement; Trump noted the deal will help to stop auto jobs from going overseas and bring back auto jobs that already left, while Canada Foreign Minister Freeland said that the US and Canada are to provide transparency on dairy, pointing out that the steel tariff issue is different from the trade deal (note the dairy issue was said to be a sticking point in the trade pact); she also opposed the legality of 232 tariffs. Similarly, Canadian PM Trudeau warned that steel and aluminium tariffs are an obstacle to prosperity, adding there is a lot of more work to do to lower trade tariffs. The 10-year yield managed to keep its head above 3.00% at settle.
  *  ITALY: EU Commission President Juncker announced that progress in talks with Italy on budget are being made while reports suggested that Italian PM Conte and Economy Minister Tria are studying cutting the 2019 deficit/GDP target to around 2% in order to reach a deal with the EU.
  * FED: Fed's Williams (Voter, Neutral) did not comment on current rate policy; he sees the neutral rate low for the foreseeable future, and added that if the Fed sticks to its 2% inflation target, expectations could slip. Fed's Kashkari (Dove, Non-voter) thinks the Fed should pause on rate hikes as now close to neutral rates but believes there is a lot of uncertainty where neutral is.  On the economy, he highlighted that labour market keeps surprising and slack remains while the extent of labour force expansion is still unknown; inflation expectations are very anchored. He sees China as a big uncertainty.
  * CHICAGO PMI leaped to 66.4 in November from 58.4, beating significantly the 58.5 consensus and rising to a 11-month high. The headline is well known for its sensitivity to Boeing’s aircraft orders though this year it has been more responsive to the US-China trade dispute, Pantheon notes. Moreover, the figure is often highly correlated to the ISM PMI Index but does not always guarantee a rebound in the ISM reading which touched a 6-month low last month. Analysts at Pantheon note that “manufacturing remains under pressure from the tariffs, but the sector is not rolling over” and they argue that the narrative would change “if the current 10% tariff rate jumps to 25% in January”.
  * CANADIAN GDP on a quarterly basis posted at 0.5% below the 0.7% consensus while the yy headline came in at 2.0%, as expected. Scotiabank notes that the components were somehow mixed since investment disappointed relative to the BoC’s Business Outlook Survey intentions; consumption added 0.7 point to the headline in Q3 while inventories subtracted 1.3 pct points and imports added 2.8 pct points, an interesting figure which could be “flagging a substitution effect from accelerating domestic oil production that has crowded out oil imports”. Nonetheless, the broad growth should keep the BoC on track on its current path also as uncertainty diminishes following the latest validation of the USMCA agreement.
  * SPX +0.79% at 2759, NDX +0.82% at 6949, DJI +0.75% at 25530. SECTORS: Energy -0.24%, Materials +0.39%, Industrials +1.01%, Cons Discretionary +0.63%, Cons Staples +0.83%, Healthcare +1.01%, Financials +0.59%, Tech +1.05%, Telecoms +0.42%, Utilities +1.52%.
  *STOCK SPECIFICS: Airlines (DAL, AAL, LUV, UAL) opened higher due to a fall in crude prices, on the flipside oil producers lagged (EOG, HAL, SLB). AT&amp;T (T) rose on it announcing increased cash flow in 2019 and a reduced debt ratio. Under Armour (UA, UAA) benefitted from an upgrade at Wells Fargo. Chipmakers NVIDIA (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) drifted higher through the day. Laboratory Corporation of America (LH) was an underperformer after announcing a soft business outlook. Marriott International (MAR) tanked after news broke of a major guest data breach. General Electric (GE) opened lower following reports it had not made adequate reserves for insurance losses. Goldman Sachs (GS) traded lower on the back of the Federal Reserve ramping up its investigation into the bank’s involvement with the Malaysian 1MDB fund. Symantec (SYMC) drifted lower after its COO resigned.
  * WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 0.52 LOWER AT USD 50.93/BBL, BRENT (F8) SETTLES USD 0.80 LOWER AT USD 58.71. The attention is on the G20 ahead of next week’s OPEC meeting; the positive noises US President Trump has been making about doing a deal with China has supported crude, as traders’ reason that positive relations between the world’s two largest economies is likely to be positive for global trade, and therefore growth, and therefore oil demand. Looking to next week’s OPEC meeting, Russia’s energy minister said OPEC and non-OPEC producers were happy comfortable with oil at current prices (echoing comments from Putin earlier in the week, who said he was happy with oil at $60/bbl), with the Russian oil minister also stating that Russian oil companies agree to change output levels in 2019, if needed. The consensus expects OPEC to announce some sort of cut to current output levels, with the Street looking for at least 1mln BPD to be cut (though earlier reports have suggested that a figure of 1.4mln was discussed, with some reports on Friday suggesting that OPEC’s economic panel had floated 1.3mln BPD cut to balance the oil market). The key question is who will trim inventories, with nations unwilling to be the one that bears the burden of most of the cuts (read: Saudi Arabia, and Russia); Novak commented that Russian production in 2019 is seen at the same levels as 2018, for now. OPEC’s November oil output was down by 160k BPD to 33.1mln BPD after US sanctions on Iran, according to reports; members raised compliance in November to 120% of pledged cuts vs. revised to 110 % in October; record Saudi oil supply, higher UAE output make up for much of Iranian decline. Elsewhere, Baker Hughes this week reported total rigs were down by 3 at 1076; oil rigs up 2 at 887, while gas rigs were down 5 rigs at 189.
  * US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 4 TICKS HIGHER AT 119-17+. The Treasury complex seems to have been detached from the broader themes (G20/trade/etc), once again putting in a lacklustre performance with a thin range, as traders refrain from making any major moves ahead of the outcome of the dinner between Trump/Xi, as well as on month-end. Fed’s Kashkari (dove, non-voter) also lent some support to the complex, though in reality, it was a rattling-off of his usual dovish views. Major curve spreads narrowed modestly by between 0.5bps to 2bps, though 10s30s were a touch wider.  
  * USD: The Dollar is ending a relatively topsy-turvy week pretty mixed vs currency counterparts, and perhaps remarkably the DXY is not that far from where it started within a 97.543-96.622 range just under 97.000.  The major catalysts and drivers have been Fed and flow-related, but the Greenback has also been taking cues or rather influenced by moves elsewhere. In terms of independent impulses, the Buck has benefited from tax repatriation demand and earlier in the week a moderate month end rebalancing bid that only switched around to a similar sell signal on Friday, along with the latest SOMA settlement that represented a net $12.6 bn Usd shortfall to be covered. However, on the flipside, FOMC chair Powell and minutes from the November policy meeting effectively tweaked forward guidance ahead of the next meeting and widely anticipated 4th rate hike of 2018, with references to Fed Funds now being near neutral vs ‘a long way off’ in the case of the Fed chair previously.
  * EUR: On the back foot vs the Usd, and as usual the main loser over SOMA, with the single currency still finding 1.1400 a tough level to breach amidst a barrage of offers, the ongoing Italian-EU budget impasse (albeit discussions reportedly making progress towards a compromise), more soft Eurozone data and expectations that the ECB could downgrade is risk assessment next month in acknowledgement of the fact. Eur/Usd has now slipped under 1.1350 where hefty option expiries were sitting but remains well off worst levels traded this week near 1.1265, with support coming indirectly via Eur/Gbp amidst the usual end of month RHS interest (cross hovering around 0.8900 vs a 0.8925 peak and circa 0.8850 trough).
  * GBP: Aside from the aforementioned and customary selling vs the single currency, the Pound was buffeted by Brexit headlines and growing Parliamentary opposition to UK PM May draft withdrawal plan despite her best efforts to persuade doubters to back it, plus more Cabinet members signalling their support. Cable is currently just below 1.2750 and heading for another test of recent lows around 1.2725 from 1.2850+ at best, with a pretty bleak assessment of the economy in a no deal scenario from the Government looking almost upbeat compared to BoE analysis in that eventuality.
  * SEK, CHF: Major underperformers due to data and totally unexpected 0.2% q/q GDP contractions (unlike the -0.1% from Italy vs stagnant flash estimate that hardly surprised given all its well documented issues), with the Swedish Krona retreating sharply vs the Eur towards 10.3500 and Swiss Franc back down near parity vs the Usd/sub-1.1300 against the Eur.
  * CAD, AUD, NZD: Contrasting fortunes for the non-US Dollars, with the Loonie not deriving much encouragement from the historic or symbolic signing of the USMCA (nor the Mxn for that matter) even though Canada is said to have secured dairy concessions. Sliding crude prices, mixed data and diplomatic issues as it implemented sanctions against Saudi Arabia, all weighed on sentiment and pushed Usd/Cad up through 1.3300, close to the wtd high of 1.3360 vs sub-1.3200 at the other extreme. Conversely, the Aud looks on course to register net gains vs its US peer, albeit modest as a proxy for China and latest PMI surveys showing a worrying slowdown in the official manufacturing headline to bang on 50.0 just ahead of the eagerly awaited Trump-Xi dinner on Saturday evening. On that note, expectations have been lifted by Whitehouse commentary suggesting a ‘successful’ meeting and the US President himself declaring he is close to a trade agreement with Beijing, but unsure if he wants to accept it. However, prospects for something positive appear better than they were. Staying down under, the Kiwi has benefited from bullish cross-winds as Aud/Nzd retreated through 1.0650, confirmation of more relaxed mortgage rules announced in the RBNZ’s FSR, and the broader Usd retracement from highs. Nzd/Usd got to within a whisker of its 200 DMA circa 0.6850 vs 0.6750 at the low.
  * JPY: As usual, the safe-haven has been largely tracking overall swings in risk sentiment and inversely vs the Usd, but is weaker on balance within relatively restrained 112.85-114.00 parameters after slipping down through several chart supports, but gleaning some comfort from a downturn in US Treasury yields (10s hovering around 3% and briefly under).
  * EM: A volatile week for many regional currencies for a variety or myriad of reasons/factors, including oil’s extended sell-off, geopolitics, macro releases, Central Bank impulses and the Usd’s changing fortunes. However, the Try was a standout mover and outperformer as it continued to rally through the technical 5.2000 mark and almost breached a key technical level (Fib around 5.1550) before losing momentum in wake of 2 failed attempts to close above.",WSBConsensus,1543706683,1,0,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/a280zr/wrap_it_up_bois/
HUGE gainz opportunity on Monday with binary event on $GBT - thank me later,"On Monday at 3pm Global Blood Therapeutics is presenting data from their Phase III HOPE study and giving a regulatory update on their drug Volexotor's status with the FDA. If you guys have been reading Martin Shkreli's blog, $GBT is one of his favorite longs and he thinks the drug really works. I see a few possible scenarios from monday's presentation:

1. Data is good and FDA gives accelerated approval based on current data - stock goes up between 60-120%
2. Data is good but no accelerated approval, FDA still requires more data - stock goes up between 20-40%
3. Bad data and no accelerated approval - stock goes down 50%

Based on the recent drop in the stock this week, sentiment for the meeting is very low but this provides a really good risk/reward opportunity to make some serious gainz. I calculated the payouts and would recommend going for either

DEC 21 45$ calls or DEC 21 40$ calls, but if you want to add a safety net go for JAN 18 40$ as there is a chance they will present good data on Monday but only get accelerated approval in late December.

I'm all in VKTX,"I'm all in on Viking Therapeutics because I believe there are multiple ways that this jumps up. 

1. Acquisition: With very strong P2 data, and plenty of cash on hand due to the recent capital raise, I think this is a takeover target for any big pharma looking to enter the NASH market without starting from scratch. 

2. Diversification: Beyond showing excellent trial results for its prospective NASH treatment, the company also boasts a bone density treatment that is in the early stages of development, which gives it another coal in the fire.

3. Relative value: the company's main competitors (icpt, mdgl) are being valued significantly higher, and while icpt will likely be first to market, mdgl isn't really ahead of vktx, and it completely lacks diversification as it only has one viable candidate in its pipeline. 

4. Data: The market reacted very favorably to the phase 2 results for Viking's NASH candidate, and the company has enough cash on hand to go it alone in a phase 3 trial, in my opinion. The data also appear to be stronger than icpt in some ways, which may make up for it not being first to market if the p3 trial results support this in the coming years.

Anyone have any thoughts on this one? I'm balls deep and looking to see a $15+ share price by December 31st. ",MorrisTuchenbloom,1543606252,1,11,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/a1vm58/im_all_in_vktx/

I got some real DD for you boys. $WTRH,"So the company has no options to long the shit out of  so I know I might be preaching to the wall, but hear me out.

A food delivery service called WAITR (https://waitrapp.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoMjZvLXf3gIVGI_ICh1sQgw6EAAYASAAEgIxZvD_BwE) was just purchased and went public in a $308 million dollar merger agreement by a holding company owned by T.J. Ferttita (the owner of the Golden Nugget casinos, Landry’s restaurants, the Houston Rockets, and the host of Billion Dollar TV on CNBC). https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181115006138/en/Landcadia-Holdings-Completes-Acquisition-Waitr-Incorporated

The details of the acquisition, SEC filings, WAITR financial reports, etc: https://www.landcadiaholdings.com

The merger occurred on November 15th with an affirmative share holder vote. The holding company’s name “Lancadia Holdings” ($LCA) was renamed WAITR Holdings ($WTRH).

WAITR operates much in the same way as other food delivery services except for its flat fee delivery rate. Whether it’s a $10 order or a $10,000 dollar order the delivery fee is still $5. This is somewhat steep for the individual consumer but they make up for it in business bulk lunch orders where money is saved when using WAITR as opposed to the delivery pricing of other services.

WAITR’s key market strategy is to serve underserved markets in rural and developing towns and cities in the southeast United States. They are growing RAPIDLY and even in markets where they’re in competition with the big boys they’re holding their own with 40% of the market share (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grubhub-rival-just-raised-estimates-144243633.html?.tsrc=rss)

Between $11-14 seems to be a fair entry point for a mid to long position in many’s estimation. The only obstacle may be low number of outstanding shares and low volume. Both of which can be rectified in the future. 

Might be a good chance to long the food delivery market at a low cost. Considering it’s too late to get in  with GrubHub, and considering Postmates and Uber don’t go public till next year the current share price seems more than reasonable.

Stark Industries (SIA) Calls Gang!,"With SIA dropping a lot after they moved to renewable energy from weapons they where down 50% that year but we saw an increase of 150% when Tony Stark relased the new arc reactor and started to slowly use it on his tech because the tech seemed limitless.

So check out this play:

Now, with half of the population dying a few months ago the markets have turned for the worse. But this is WSB and we bet on big gains baby! I'm betting Tony didn't die and will come back to earth. Not only will this resume business and cause the stock to bounce back, but I think it will MOOOON! Stark will make more tech to help the world with getting its grid system back to normal. If Stark comes back he will be able to fix the messed up infrastructure and businesses will be booming baby.

Buy Disney and hold at least until end of next year. Or yolo on long calls...[DD inside],"Disney is out for blood in the box office for 2019. Their movie line-up next year is going to shatter records. Here's the list of Disney movies coming out next year. I've also taken the time to put my prediction for how much money they would make from these movies based on past performance and popularity of the source material. 

* March 8 - Captain Marvel &gt; **800 million**
* March 29 - Dumbo &gt; **600 million**
* May 3 - Avengers 4 &gt; **2 billion**
* May 24 - Aladdin &gt; **700 million**
* June 21 - Toy Story 4 &gt; **1.2 billion**
* July 5 - Spiderman: Far From Home &gt; **600 million**
* July 19 - The Lion King &gt; **1.6 billion**
* August 9 - Artemis Fowl (based on that gay book you read in middle school) &gt; **500 million**
* November 22 - Frozen 2 &gt; **1.2 billion**
* December 20 - Star Wars Episode IX &gt; **1.4 billion**

In case you're not used to big numbers because your portfolio is always in the red: That's about 5 guaranteed movies that will make over 1 billion dollars each, with 2 of those approaching 2 billion or surpassing it. I estimate Disney will make over 10 billion dollars next year from films alone. Given how merchandise-able these movies are, expect even more from toys and other shit.

Medmen Warrants,"The cannabis market is America is going to be 10 times to size of Canada. Right now the major Canadian players cannot have a footprint in the USA until federal legislation changes. Companies based in the US are building the business  one state at a time vertically integrated. These US players do not have access to banking services until the STATES act is passed. Institutions have yet to enter the space so they trade at a enormous discount to Canadian peers.  


One of the biggest players and best known brands in called Medmen. Through a combination of macro market issues, revising a bought deal and expensive aggressive expansion, the share price has been reduced by 50% over the past month.

This is a report released today from Prescience Point Management - a very well performing short fund - and it covers a wide range of accounting and structuring issues that they found in Kellogg. 

They have been short Kellogg for awhile on suspicion of accounting issues and have recently doubled down after Kellogg made reporting changes during their Investor Day. 

Im 10000% making a play on this eventually but there shouldn't be any movement, based on these issues, until the next earnings report. Cant yolo now, but mark your calendar for their next report, FEB 7th.

The stock market is in the biggest bubble of all time due to a low rate environment from the last financial crisis. These Low rates have allowed companies to pile on staggering amounts of debt.

The neutral rate has been getting lower every year, Interest rates may have passed the point of no return in terms of triggering a Bear Market.

How to profit on the possible financial crisis that is brewing

Now this is a long shot and I wouldn't recommend spending any money that you couldn't afford to be a complete loss.

Open a Robinhood App Brokerage account

Robinhood is a brokerage that allows you to make trades with no commission (this is good because the commision on the amount of contracts required for this trade would be in the hundreds of dollars, eating away at the amount of contracts that could be purchased.)

Apply for Options Trading in the Robinhood App [https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001214663-Free-Options-Investing](https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001214663-Free-Options-Investing)

Look at QQQ (This is a Nasdaq Exchange Traded Fund it will move up and down as the entire Nasdaq Index moves)

In Robinhood after you pull up the ticker you want to buy you hit Trade then Trade Options. This will bring up the Options Chain.

Make sure to select Buy and Put. A put gives you the right but not the obligation to sell a certain amount of shares at the Strike price. Which could be highly profitable if QQQ Falls below the strike price ($80).

In our case we want the March 15 2019 $80 Put

QQQ’s All Time High this year was $186.65 I am basing my numbers on a drop of 65% from ATH

This would put QQQ at $65.32 If you bought 1 3/15/19 QQQ $80 Put contract you would have the right but not the obligation to sell 100 shares of QQQ at the strike price $80.

If QQQ gets to $65.32 before March 15th each contract purchased would be worth $1468

So let's say for example you bought 100 3/15/19 $80 Puts the current cost would be $5 per contract 100\*$5=$500 If it did fall to $65.32 your contracts would now be worth $146,800

For this trade to be successful the stock market has to bottom out -65% from the highs earlier this year before March 15th 2019 it is Incredibly risky and there is a good chance the entire investment will be a loss.",inco33,1542568532,1,32,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9y8scf/qqq/

Why $SVMK is the next $SNAP,"$SVMK, or SuveyMonkey, shares have rallied $30% in the past 5 days, with the majority of those gains coming on the heels of news of the SAP acquisition of $SVMK ""competitor"" Qualtrics. The sentiment being if SAP is willing to pay a 21.1x revenue multiple for Qualtrics, the space must be ripe for growth and therefore $SVMK is undervalued. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem: Qualtrics is a CX platform. $SVMK is a feature of a CX platform. This reminds me of those who thought $SNAP was a social media platform before Instagram proved their product was merely a feature of a social media platform. SAP did not buy Qualtrics because they could send surveys. They bought it because Qualtrics is an **enterprise-grade software solution** to Customer Feedback Management, of which surveys are a sizable but shrinking component. 

&amp;#x200B;

Qualtrics calls out this important distinction in their S-1:

\&gt;*Survey Tools:* Survey tools are useful for broad sampling across thousands of subjects, but lack the ability to combine data in different formats across different channels, correlate with O-data™, and apply the analytical rigor needed to determine what actions need to be taken to improve results.  
 

Need more proof?

&amp;#x200B;

Forrester, the leading market research firm in CX, [does not include $SVMK](https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+Customer+Feedback+Management+Platforms+Q4+2018/-/E-RES138491) in their analysis of the ""nine most significant"" customer feedback management providers. High-level results of that analysis can be [found here.](https://www.medallia.com/forrester-wave-2018/?utm_medium=Internal-Site-Link&amp;utm_source=Medallia&amp;utm_campaign=*Forrester-Wave-2018&amp;utm_content=Homepage-Drawer&amp;utm_term=undefined) Notice Qualtrics is 2nd in strategy, 3rd in current offering, and most importantly 1st or 2nd in market presence. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Per their S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1747748/000162828018012674/qualtricss-1.htm#s86AECE72CDD6FD36EDC828DD5009F9A4), Qualtrics has 576 customers paying more than $100,000 in annual subscriptions. This represents 52% of their subscription revenue. This is what you would expect from an enterprise software platform. 

&amp;#x200B;

By contrast, [$SVMK's S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739936/000119312518261892/d494258ds1.htm) claims 2,900 ""organizational-level"" agreements. Sounds good. Yet those only generated 12% of revenue, or approximately $10,000 per organizational-level agreement. (Their largest shareholder is also their largest customer which is a little scary.) This is NOT an enterprise-level product. This is NOT a customer feedback management platform. This is a cheap tool used by companies to figure out what date to host their holiday party.

&amp;#x200B;

But wait, maybe as the CX space expands, companies will be using more surveys and $SVMK will see some benefit? Well, refer back to the Forrester results. The top two offerings per Forrester, Qualtrics and Medallia, both build and send their own surveys. If any of them do not, do you think they can build their own survey engine for cheaper than $SVMK's $1.6B market cap? I do. As more companies embrace customer feedback as an enterprise-wide initiative, SurveyMonkey is either not poised to take advantage by lacking an enterprise-level solution, or worst case actually stands to lose market where their simple survey is replaced by an actual platform. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their Q3 earnings show that they are making large investments, presumably to build out an enterprise-level solution. But given they are not even in the space, these headwinds feel like the investment is too little, too late. Much easier for an enterprise-quality platform to build a survey tool than for a survey tool to build an enterprise-quality platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Given their massive % of ~~retard~~ retail investors, I think it will take a bit of time for them to realize all of this so I am not expecting an immediate drop, but their Q4 earnings will show this investment is falling into a black hole and I expect the stock to pay the price.

[DD Inside] YOLO AAPL Calls or Put Spread,"Alright boys, AAPL is currently trading at what it was back in July. You know what that means? YOLO season. Given that Buffet just loaded up on some more shares and that most analysts are still bullish, I think 180-190 is the floor. Yeah, *past doesn't predict future performance*, I too have read an Econ book.

I've been playing with some options for the past few hours. Here are the plays I'm considering, feel free to lose money with me:

**CALLS**

Ahh, yes, calls. The preferred degenerate gambler’s roll of the dice. This first play is for those of you with long term commitment issues and questionable taste in one night stands.

* BUY Nov 30th $192.50 Call (adjust position according to your preferred levels of masochism).

This one is so easy, even you can do it. AAPL gets back into 200s territory, you make money. The risk is if that doesn’t happen in the next two weeks, you’re fucked. If Tim has enough courage by December 1st, a share price of 200 at expiry with 30 contracts makes you about $10k less broke.

If you prefer holding options over long stock positions, this next play is for you. 

* BUY Jan 17th 2020 $200.00 Call (why don’t you just buy shares?)

As long as AAPL makes expensive things people want, this play should work. If they at least get to their current ATH again by January of 2020, you pocket about $20k (assuming you have enough money now to buy 20 contracts). In my opinion, this an overpriced and boring play, but to each their own. 

**PUT SPREADS**

If you’ve actually read this far, you might just be qualified enough to execute a put spread. 

Here’s the play I’m most likely going to execute tomorrow in tandem with a few calls.

* BUY 100 Nov 23rd $182.50 Put
* SELL 100 Nov 23rd $185.00 Put

Per [Optionsprofitcalculator.com](http://optionsprofitcalculator.com/) (I know it doesn’t account for everything, but close enough):

Entry cost: $3700 (net credit)

Maximum risk: $21300 at a price of $182.50 at expiry

Maximum return: $3700 at a price of $193.50 on day 23rd Nov 2018

Breakevens at expiry: $184.60

The thing I like about this play is you can make $3.7k as long as the stock closes at or above 186 on November 24th. Sure, you could lose $21.3k if AAPL closes at 181.50 or lower, but AAPL dropped 13 points after earnings. If you can think of an event that would make AAPL drop 9 points in the next week, go ahead and buy puts.

If you’re bullish on AAPL, but calls have done you dirty lately, this next strategy is for you.

* BUY 35 Nov 23rd $185.00 Put
* SELL 35 Nov 23rd $190.00 Put

Entry cost: $4830 (net credit)

Maximum risk: $12670 at a price of $185 at expiry

Maximum return: $4830 at a price of $190 at expiry

Breakevens at expiry: $188.60

As long as AAPL finished at or above 190, you make a little under 5k (not bad for twiddling your thumbs). This one doesn’t have the nice padding that the last play had, so anything south of 188 and you’re losing money as usual.

Really, I just wrote all this so I could feel like I had something to show for the past few hours of playing with numbers. If you found it useful/entertaining, I may do more of these in the future. The last song I listened to was Funky Duck by Vulfpeck. Let me know the name of the last song you listened to in the comments.

$PCG Distressed Debt Analysis,"With all the WSB bears piling onto PCG shorts I wanted to see what type of outlook the shares are currently reflecting to see if there is long term distressed debt contrarian value here.  As of this writing PCG is trading at 17.40 with a market cap of 13.23 billion.  Before the wildfire liability concern PCG was trading at 48.8 with a market cap of 37.104 billion.  A difference of 23.8748 billion, so investors are extremely worried and starting to price potential bankruptcy.  Theres also news of liability insurance falling short and this is likely exacerbating the issue.  Using wikipedia for reference for some numbers and referencing real estate averages on google I'm attempting to generate a liability range.  Sources and chart included at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick review shows two ongoing fires.  Campe Butte and Woolsey Los Angeles.  Between the two of these there are allegedly 287 people missing or dead, 9620 residential buildings destroyed, 260 commercial buildings destroyed, and 238362 acres of land destroyed.  Camp butte's containment is currently at 40% and Woolsey is at 57%.  

&amp;#x200B;

Using google to get insurance averages, here are some values that I'm using

* Time article for insurance prices human life around 129000.  
* Average residential is 544900.  
* Average commercial is 3302924.  
* Average acre is 7200.

Doing simple average damage so far is \~7.62 billion.  I'm using this as the floor for my estimate.  This would assume that everything is resolved rapidly and no further damage.  The way that I am calculating the high end is that I am doubling the amount due to containment being at 40%, however, this is likely an extremely high estimate because fire damage is exponential, not linear, and likely the worst has already passed.  But there will be lawsuits coming and so will be giving ourselves lots of buffer.  Using the double metric puts damage projections at 15.24 billion.  The high end of my estimate is still 8.63 billion short of how investors are pricing the damage.  

&amp;#x200B;

High damage estimate - 15.24 billion

Low damage estimate - 7.62 billion

Current equity damage estimate - 23.87 billion

Discrepancy from high - 8.63 billion

Discrepancy from low - 16.25 billion

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming we conclude the the fires at the high end of the estimate then PCG could return to trading at 24 with a market cap of 21.9 billion, so still damaged, but far less than currently expected.

&amp;#x200B;

Price target: $24

&amp;#x200B;

This trade will require conclusion of lawsuits and the like, so don't expect this to be resolved by the EOW.  This would be a buy the equity or sell a put credit spread, preferable being put credit spread as that benefits from theta.

For any of you that took a microeconomics class you may remember elasticity of demand, this is a measure of how much the demand changes for a product when the price is changed. Iphones have a relatively inelastic demand, meaning that with a change in the price, the quantity demanded by consumers will not change as much.

EXAMPLE: Price increases 20%, demand will only decrease by 10%

The image is a graphical representation of this concept.

I'm sure that when Apple decided to increase their prices they had analysts examine sales data. They likely know what they're doing. And came to the conclusion that with a price increase they could increase their overall sales revenue. Their decision to no longer report unit sales was likely to prevent a drastic drop of $AAPL. The recent decline in $AAPL is an overreaction in my opinion, and when people realize this it will return to previous highs. PAPA BUFFET knows this and he ain't worried. I'm buying $AAPL calls til I'm out of money, then I'll take a loan and buy more. TENDIES INCOMING!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Apple likely employs smart people, they wouldn't raise their prices without any sales analysis.",DoubleProfit,1542304286,1,0,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9xdgps/aapl_dd_inside/
How to be a millionaire before 2019,"I finally figured it out guys.   

  

This is the unedited and raw perfect edition of how to be a millionaire before 2019 with only $500.00.   

  

Let's first start off with some calculations.   

  

How much do you need to multiply your money to be a millionaire with only $500?   

   

&amp;#x200B;

`1000000/500 = 2000`   

  

&amp;#x200B;

Guys, you only need to multiply your money 2000 times to be a millionaire!     
   

It seems like a daunting challenge, but I will break it down real quick for you on how to make it easily before 2019.  



&amp;#x200B;

There are currently 46 days before the end of the year.   



We only need 42 days.    



How?   

   

Let me show you Warren Buffett's secret weapon that nobody else has discovered yet!!    

   

If you make 20% of $500 in one day, you get    



`500 * 0.2 = 100`   

   

$100 profits right?    

   

Well, now you have $600.    



What if you make 20% of that again the next day???       



`600 * 0.2 = 120`   



You get $120! It doesn't seem like much right now, but if you do this a bigly number of times, the numbers get very very, very big. The best numbers! But don't listen to me, just look at the numbers.    



Since we're making 20% each day, we need to find the number of days before we reach 2000x our money (to get to $1,000,000). I set up a very very smart equation, the best equation of them all for you guys.   

   

1.2^(x) = 2000    

   

Guys, all we need is ""x"" number of days to make 2000 times our money!! Let's solve for x.   



`(log 2000) / (log 1.2) = x`   

   

Here, the log base can be anything as long as they are the same.   

   

`x = 41.689543426`    

   

And there you have it boys. For the first time in history, I'm giving you industry expert exclusive content. You only need 42 days to make $1,000,000 from $500!!! That's why everyone is so rich these days and we are all so poor. We never knew this information! But no longer - I'm giving you this insider information!    

   

Well, you're welcome. I'll see you boys in tendie haven at the end of the year! Happy tending!

[This](https://oilvoice.com/Opinion/25268/US-Crude-Oil-and-Natural-Gas-Production-Increased-in-2017-With-Fewer-Wells) is saying that the US is going to reach record production levels.

GE is over party🎉🎉🎉 DD on why you should be buying GE puts like nothing else on the market rn,"Current state of GE:

*Down 14% this week, 34.6% this month, and a whopping 59% this year. Shattered 5 year lows a couple weeks ago and hasnt looked back once.

*under investigation by DOJ and SEC. wont be resolved til January at the earliest.

*past ER was massive miss. Dividend cut to one cent/share. One year profit forecast removed as a bitch move to save some face from their truth

*SeekingAlpha has confirmed that the large one off 10M+ GE candles today were institutional selloffs. The institutions would not sell here if they see anything of an upside, but they did, at the *all time low*.

*Yahoo Finance has confirmed GE is fire-selling assets in order to reduce debt. Nothing is reportedly sacred &amp; all offers are being fielded as theyre trying to reduce leverage. If people offer them the right price they will be selling assets for net loss just to have cash on hand.

 *CEO Larry Culp is currently sitting on the sideline watching all this happen as his 416,000 shares @ average price $11.25 are losing him roughly 11,640 a day. I have a firm belief that he’ll want to do as much damage control for his personal finances as he can once he starts bridging into 35-40% loss (28.8% as i type this). When those shares &amp; the news about them hit the market, investor faith will hit all time lows.

The lone shining light in a dark, wet, shit stained room for GE is that their healthcare sector hasnt IPO’d yet, which is a separate company &amp; would be a separate stock than GE, and at the end of the day, it is just asset selling to alleviate debt. Im sure ive also not counted every single detrimental piece of news such as the plethora of credit downgrades &amp; institutional target price slashes.

ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE,"    Asia trades relatively flat after having shrugged-off opening weakness and Friday's Wall St lossesAsia equity markets trade indecisive but off worst levels after having shrugged-off most the opening losses and the weak performance on Wall St last Friday, where ongoing global growth concerns and continued weakness in commodities weighed on sentiment. ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) both recovered from the early declines to trade marginally positive but with weakness in tech and financials capping gains in Australia, while recent flows into JPY limited upside for the Japanese benchmark. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.2%) are choppy amid growth and trade-related uncertainty, while the PBoC recently noted that China’s economy is under increasing downward pressure and officials have continued to pledge measures to support businesses including wider tax cuts.
  In FX markets, the USD holds on to recent gains and tests the 97.00 level to the upside as its major counterparts struggle with EUR/USD at the weaker end of the 1.1300 handle, while GBP/USD gapped lower towards the 1.2900 level after reports that UK PM May cancelled an emergency cabinet meeting due to strong opposition regarding her Brexit plans which severely lessens the likelihood of an EU summit later this month. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies have nursed Friday’s losses as they find solace from early strength in oil prices after Saudi announced to reduce its exports by 500k bpd next month, while JPY-crosses are slightly higher amid the somewhat improved risk sentiment but still have far to got to get back to last week’s highs.
  Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively flat with price action contained as pressure from the slight improvement in regional sentiment is counterbalanced by the BoJ",WSBConsensus,1541991784,1,5,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9wa7nd/asiapac_midsession_update/
Concerns shorting TLRY,"I read the couple posts this week talking about TLRY and why we should short it. After learning about the share lockup expiry in Jan I agree that the share price will crash hard. However I have some concerns about buying Jan puts now. The IV is so incredibly high in part because the float of shares available to short is so few. So while the share price is very likely to tank, won't the IV crush on the options be incredibly bad as well? When the remaining 89 percent of the shares hit the market, the expensive premium to short shares based on their scarcity will no longer be there. Not to mention that the time value left on Jan options will have dropped incredibly because the lockup expiry is three days before the option expiry date. Is the best way to increase chance of profits on this play to buy puts that are ITM or just slightly OTM now to ensure a higher intrinsic option value when the share price inevitably tanks, despite the astronomical initial cost per contract? Or would it be better to buy cheaper deep OTM puts that will likely lose most of its IV value but will likely end up slightly ITM? I'm talking $60 or even $50 puts. Or, is the safer play to buy options for March instead so that they still retain some time value at the time of the share lockup expiry?  Or maybe am I an idiot for trying to make this play at all and I should just stay away, especially right before earnings. How are you guys playing TLRY?

Now, we are approaching the next clinical trial results, which should show even better results as the last trial was stymied by improper drug distribution. IF they were able to figure that problem out, then we should be seeing positive results. Also check out that website its beautiful.   
[https://www.sophirisbio.com/patients/clinical-trials/](https://www.sophirisbio.com/patients/clinical-trials/)

A few months before the 2016 results came in we see \~70% jump in price that falls to below the normal price for a few months, after hitting a low it shoots up. We are seeing this pattern repeat itself again. News on the trial results is coming in december, a shitty earnings report is coming up next week. I urge you to buy low and sell high brothers.

Short $AMRN [Irrefutable DD inside],"Before you downvote, hear me out. $AMRN Vascepa results are very misleading. No conspiracy theories here. I truly believe that the 25% reduction in CV risk was due to the combination of Statins and prescribed diet that the patients were on, not Vascepa. I do NOT believe that Vascepa works on its own. It is simply glorified fish oil. It marketing campaign is akin to Hollywood style beauty product marketing. Their point? That Vascepa does the exact same thing as omega-3 fatty acid capsules except without “additives” that supposedly raise your LDL-Cholesterol levels. Am I the only one who sees something really wrong here. They make it so it is impossible to tell whether the results were due to Vascepa or the diet. It was most likely the diet because fish oil is useless. The only thing that could prove me wrong here is that if the placebo group was not on the diet.

Is this free money or am I just disabled,"Hey guys its Double Down Danny, I'm new here, entry-level workforce, got some extra cash now and there's nothing I really want out of life besides a yacht so I decided I'd rather risk all my money for a chance at greatness then be safe and make steady gainz and die a middle class nobody wondering what would have happened if I bought those FD's.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway back to my question; now I'm no expert quant with a line out my front door of people waiting to give me head in exchange for expert level mathematically sound DD but hear me out. (I read an article guys)

&amp;#x200B;

Aurora: $8.38 B market cap

Tilray: $10.5 B market cap

&amp;#x200B;

Aurora currently produces about 7 times more weedz then Tilray and also its expected peak production however many years down the road (idgaf I'll be retired off my FD gainz by then) is going to be 3x higher than Tilray. Aurora's Revenue's are way higher too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically all the numbers/guidance are better for Aurora but Tilray has a higher market cap.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at the other weed boyz too and idk man this guy Tilray reminds me of that girl that gave me head my freshman year of college, everyone thought I was hot shit until they ended up doing some DD and realized she actually had a dick.

&amp;#x200B;

US MARKET WRAP - 9th November 2018: WTI sees tenth day of losses,"#US MARKET WRAP – 9th November 2018

TLDR; Equities down, Treasuries up, dollar up, crude down.


* REAR-VIEW: US Final PPI jumps; Michigan confidence moderates; Jo Johnson resigned from PM May’s government; Eurogroup’s Centeno does not exclude procedure against Italy; PBOC sees “downward pressures” in China economy.

* NEXT WEEK: EU Summit (TBC), Deadline for Italian budget re-submission, Japanese PPI &amp; GDP, UK Labour Market report, OPEC Monthly Report, Australian NAB Business Conditions, German ZEW Survey, US Federal Budget, Chinese Retail Sales, UK CPI, Eurozone GDP Flash &amp; Employment, US CPI, Australian Labour Market report, UK Retail Sales, US Philly Fed, NY Fed Mfg, Indonesian Rate Decision, Eurozone CPI, US Industrial Production.

  * BREXIT: In latest comments, Irish PM Varadkar said negotiations are at a sensitive point noting that a deal is possible in the next couple of weeks though highlighting that a lot of things can go wrong; and similarly German Foreign Affairs Minister Maas said to be optimistic on an agreement but he is still preparing for a no deal. Elsewhere, UK Junior Transport Minister Jo Johnson resigned from the position over PM May's proposed plan with sources reporting that more government resignations could follow from this, whilst PM May once again denied any possibility of a second referendum. In later trade, the EU was said to require more movement from the UK on Brexit while the EU Commission briefed EU27 representatives; Brexit negotiations are set to continue over the weekend. As a brief summary, optimism at the start of the week in wake of reports that UK PM May secured private concessions from Brussels was short-lived after UK Cabinet meetings were unable to strike any meaningful progress. Cabinet members, led by Environment Minister Gove demanded full legal advice before signing-off on May’s deal, which subsequently delayed an EU ambassador meeting which was scheduled to assess the viability of an emergency November EU summit. Furthermore, both the Republic of and Northern Ireland voiced their discontent with PM May’s efforts to resolve the Irish border issue, thus bringing into question the UK PM’s ability to strike a deal with Brussels and then have the numbers to pass it in the UK Parliament given the supply and confidence agreement with the DUP. As such, next week will most likely be absolutely crucial in determining whether or not both sides can strike an agreement with a slew of meetings scheduled to attempt to break the deadlock. A breakdown in talks with no meaningful progress will almost inevitably be treated as a market negative, whereas an agreement between the EU and UK will be met positively; however, the longevity of any moves in this scenario might be brought into question as markets then asses the viability of May passing the deal in Parliament.

  * TRADE: European Trade Commissioner Malmstrom said the US still shows little interest in tariff cuts deal and added the EU is working as fast as possible on a trade deal with the US. Elsewhere, US Trade Advisor Navarro stated US steel and aluminium tariffs have spurred investment and has not led to the disasters predicted; he added US economic security is national security. Also, US Secretary of State Pompeo stated the US is seeking friendly and constructive dialogue with China while Chinese Official Yang said China has committed itself to working with the US in a non-confrontational way adding economic teams will seek mutually acceptable solution on trade. Yang added that China’s door to dialogue has and will remain open.  

  * ITALY: On Friday, Eurogroup Head Centeno stated that sanctions against Italy are not on the agenda right now, whilst Economy Minister Tria said he doesn't take for granted that there will be excessive procedure against Italy. Nonetheless, such a move would be a serious test of the populist government’s resolve and would either force the hand of the government to lower its demands or defy the EC; either outcome would likely be costly for the government. Alongside this, after the EU Commission expressed the view that the deficit/GDP ratio will reach 2.9% on Thursday, Deputy PM Di Maio and Finance Minister Tria reiterated their commitment to the 2.4% deficit goal in 2019. Di Maio also stated he does not think the EU will levy sanctions on Italy whilst Tria, commenting on the spread, said a 300bps widening is worrying if it lasts for long and note it stretched to 301bps on Friday.

  * US PPI: October PPI beat to the upside, with the headline printing 0.6% MM, beating the 0.2% consensus. Core also beat to the upside (0.5% MM vs 0.2% expected). “This looks terrible, but all the overshoot to consensus is in the wildly volatile trade services component, which measures margins in retailing and wholesaling and accounts for 23% of the core,” Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote, “we expected a rebound after a run of soft numbers but the 1.6% m/m jump was bigger than we expected; it likely will correct in November.” Pantheon also notes that core goods prices were unchanged, and the rate of increase is slowing as the push from rising oil prices fades. “Car and light truck prices fell sharply m/m, perhaps explaining why auto sales were so strong last month. Core services inflation has peaked too, unless oil prices rebound strongly” the consultancy said, adding that “in short, this looks to us like a one-time spike in the core; it doesn’t change our views on the outlook for either the PPI or measures of consumer inflation at all.”

  * US UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: Consumer sentiment saw a small moderation in November, according to the University of Michigan. “Importantly, interviewing went through Wednesday night so there was only a one-day overlap after the mid-term election results were known by consumers,” Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin, “those few cases held expectations that were identical with the data collected earlier in the month, which is not so surprising given that the split between the House and Senate was widely anticipated.” The survey also stated that the unchanged data meant that the Sentiment Index remained higher thus far in 2018 (98.4) than in any prior year since 2000. “The stability of consumer sentiment at high levels acts to mask some important underlying shifts,” the survey said, “income expectations have improved, and consumers anticipate continued robust growth in employment, but consumers also anticipate rising inflation and higher interest rates.”

  * FED: Fed's Williams (voter, neutral) said sustainable growth depends on healthy job market.

  * SPX -0.9% at 2781, NDX -1.7% at 7039, DJI -0.7% at 25989. SECTORS: Energy -0.4%, Materials -1.4%, Industrials -1.4%, Cons Discretionary -1.5%, Cons Staples +0.5%, Healthcare -0.3%, Financials -0.9%, Tech -1.7%, Telecoms -1.5%, Utilities +0.1%.

  * STOCK SPECIFICS: Walt Disney (DIS) was a top mover today after it beat EPS and revenue estimates. Campbell Soup (CPB) traded higher following investment firm Third Point urging shareholders to vote in favour of its trimmed list of board nominees. Several consumer staples outperformed today such as Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Coty (COTY) and Kimberley-Clark (KMB). Activision Blizzard (ATVI) nosedived after missing EPS and revenue estimates and significantly cutting its EPS guidance. Century Link (CTL) also dipped lower after poor earnings. General Electric (GE) was a bottom mover on the back of JPMorgan lowering its price target, citing dismal earnings. A drop in copper prices lead to a fall in the miner Freeport-McMoRan (FXC). Trade-sensitive stocks, such as Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), traded lower after negative economic data from China.

  * WTI FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 48C LOWER AT $ 60.19/BBL; BRENT (F9) SETTLES 47C LOWER AT $ 70.18/BBL. WTI fell for the tenth straight session, a losing streak not seen in 35 years. Front month WTI has been trying to form a base around $60/bbl, while some note that technical factors could portend a bounce-back is on the cards since the RSI is in oversold territory not seen in four years. Both Brent and WTI are now in bear market territory. The narrative being cited is that although Iranian sanctions were seen as hitting oil output, the US has granted sanction waivers, while inventory builds are adding to the downside. On the demand side of the equation, trade wars, concerns about a slowdown in China, and the recent global GDP growth revisions lower by some institutions has put a negative shadow over WTI. On Friday, Baker Hughes reported that US drillers added oil rigs for the fourth week in five (+12 in the week, while gas rigs +2 in the week, taking the total rig count +14).

  * US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 11 TICKS HIGHER AT 118-04. Although the Fed’s statement on Thursday was largely considered hawkish, Treasuries resumed its role as a haven amid the stock slide and renewed concerns around the Chinese economy (PBOC sees downward pressures on China growth, in its Q3 monpol implementation report, which brought out buyers in Tsys), with yields coming in by between c.3-4bps by settlement; major curve spreads were generally biased towards flattening (of up to around 1.5bps) though the 5s30s and 10s30s part of the curve was modestly wider.

 #WEEKLY FX WRAP 

 *USD: Another topsy-turvy week for the Dollar, but in contrast to its sharp retracement from last Wednesday’s new ytd peak, it has been a case of stopping the rot and regrouping after a midweek/post-midterm election slump. Indeed, the DXY looks set to end Friday’s session around 96.700 and almost 100 ticks off worst levels, with decent prospects of netting a small gain vs ‘opening’ levels circa 96.402, partly on the back of firmer than forecast US PPI data and an upbeat Fed keeping end of 2018 tightening firmly on the agenda.

  * CAD: The Loonie has essentially mirrored Greenback moves or been most inversely-correlated than other majors, with sliding oil prices exacerbating its marked downturn as the week draws to a close. Canadian data did not really factor, as Usd/Cad rebound to 1.3200 from circa 1.3050 at one stage.

  * GBP: Also largely oblivious to UK data, even when a barrage finally arrived on the final session of the week and included relatively encouraging Q3 GDP and a narrower than expected trade deficit. Instead, the Pound was split between Brexit headline-watching and external impulses with more reports about progress towards a deal with the EU offset by denials, in-house Government squabbling and above all else still no Irish border/customs union/back-stop resolution. Hence, Cable currently not far from where it started the week (1.3040) within a 1.2960-1.3175 range, and awaiting any news about another Cabinet meeting over the weekend.

  * EUR: The single currency has also endured a week of fairly extreme peaks and troughs, partly in lock-step with the Buck’s changing fortunes, but also due to more Italian-EU budget wrangling that came to a head with EC forecasts highlighting marked divergence of opinion on growth, deficit, debt reduction and servicing due to BTP spread widening (as well as higher outright yields). Some downbeat Eurozone macro releases (like services PMIs) also undermined the Eur to an extent, with Eur/Usd presently back down near the base of 1.1325-1.1500 parameters.

  * AUD, NZD: The Antipodean Dollars derived little if any independent impetus from either the RBA or RBNZ even though both were a bit more upbeat in terms of economic assessments. The ongoing US-China trade spat continues to hamper the Aud especially, while the Kiwi had its wings clipped by Governor Orr keeping the option to ease the OCR on the table. However, the former has recovered well from just below 0.7200 at one stage and is now just shy of 0.7250 having popped its head above 0.7300 at best, while the Nzd is hovering around 0.6750 and closer to the upper echelons of a 0.6630-0.6800 band.

  * JPY, CHF: A late week swoon in risk sentiment has helped the Jpy in particular claw back some lost ground vs the Usd, but it is still nearer the lows than highs on the aforementioned Buck revival having traded down to 114.10 and circa 113.00. Meanwhile, the Franc has paid some heed to several reminders from the SNB, including a Government publication containing quotes from Governor Jordan, about the ongoing need for direct intervention and policy accommodation given a still highly valued Chf and currency market fragility. Hence, Usd/Chf has been mainly above parity and not far from 1.1000 earlier on Friday, with the Eur/Chf over 1.1400 for the most part, even though the single currency has had bearish factors to deal with (as noted above).

  * SEK, NOK: A solid week from both a fundamental and technical perspective for the Scandi crowns has been derailed somewhat by significantly softer than expected Norwegian inflation data, not far in advance of Swedish CPI next week that could determine whether the Riskbank opts to hike in December or February 2019. Eur/Nok currently around 9.5450 vs 9.5000 at the base this week and just over 9.5800 at the other extreme, and Eur/Sek now circa 10.2750 vs 10.3530 and 10.2430",WSBConsensus,1541799716,1,4,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9vol2z/us_market_wrap_9th_november_2018_wti_sees_tenth/

ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE,"Asia trades lower after US mid-terms rally stalls, with the Fed seen on track for a 4th hikeAsia equity markets trade mostly lower following a lacklustre lead from Wall St where the post-midterm stock rally stalled as focus shifted to the FOMC, which maintained rates as expected and provided little to derail expectations for a 4th hike this year. 

ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) are lower with energy stocks pressured after a continued slump in oil prices and as soft earnings results also clouds over Tokyo sentiment. Hang Seng (-1.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) have declined in tandem with their regional peers as tech and energy stocks lag, while continued PBoC liquidity inaction and inline inflation data also proved to be inconclusive for sentiment.
  In FX markets, the DXY holds firm and sits near post-FOMC highs as expectations remain unwavered for a December hike. The greenback had already been strengthening in the hours heading into the Fed’s penultimate meeting of 2018, which then persisted following the announcement in which the Fed stated it expects further gradual rate increases will be consistent with sustained economic expansion while it also suggested a strong view on the economy. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD languish near the prior day’s lows, while antipodeans are softer with AUD failing to benefit from the slight revisions to growth and CPI forecasts in the RBA’s Statement on Monetary Policy, as the central bank also noted a potential impact to the Asia region from the US-China trade dispute. Weakness was also observed in JPY-crosses as the risk averse tone spurs flows into safe-haven JPY and USD/JPY has slipped back below the 114.00 handle but with losses in the pair stemmed by the recent USD strength.
  Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with prices uneventful as the pressure from the recent losses in T-notes is counterbalanced by the risk averse tone and BoJ’s presence in the market for JPY 980bln of JGBs",WSBConsensus,1541733455,1,8,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9vgx24/asiapac_midsession_update/

OMER Earnings tomorrow morning,"Omeros was a meme stock at some point.  But nobody really talks about them anymore.  They fell about 25% when their latest study was released.  Basically, the results were misinterpreted by the market.  Basically, what the market say as a failed study, was really a positive.  Basically, the drug performed in line with the placebo at 12 weeks.  People saw it as a failure.  However, the placebo was not sugar water, it was steroid treatment, the current standard of care.  This is really a success because Omeros drug has a much better safety profile (steroids wreck havoc on the body).  Not only that, there was a single patient who had a flair up that skewed the results and also, the results are better over a longer time frame.

Anybody playing $TBPH next week? PDUFA for their new COPD drug is Nov. 13,"\*\*The drug:\*\* Revefenacin (brand name YUPELRI) is a bronchodilator for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). If the FDA approves it, it will be the first long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) on the market that can be taken once daily via nebulizer.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*In English:\*\* COPD is a disease whose symptoms are similar to asthma, but unlike asthma it is typically diagnosed in adults and worsens over time. Patients with COPD can reduce the frequency of exacerbations (flare-ups) by taking long-acting bronchodilators every day, either from an inhaler or from a nebulizer. There are pros and cons to each, and different patients have different preferences, but one advantage of nebulizers is that patients with advanced COPD who have difficulty taking deep breaths often find them easier to use. If it is approved, revefenacin will be the first once-daily drug of its kind for this type of treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Clinical trials:\*\* There are results from three Phase 2 trials on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) (\[NCT02109172\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02109172?term=revefenacin&amp;rank=9](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02109172?term=revefenacin&amp;rank=9)), \[NCT02040792\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02040792?term=revefenacin&amp;rank=10](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02040792?term=revefenacin&amp;rank=10)), and \[NCT01704404\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01704404?term=revefenacin&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=11](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01704404?term=revefenacin&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=11))). All three showed statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome measure, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared to a placebo. The results of Phase 3 trials are not yet posted to the site, but Theravance \[has released some data\]([https://www.empr.com/drugs-in-the-pipeline/yupelri-revefenacin-lama-long-acting-muscarinic-antagonist-copd-exacerbations/article/796275/](https://www.empr.com/drugs-in-the-pipeline/yupelri-revefenacin-lama-long-acting-muscarinic-antagonist-copd-exacerbations/article/796275/)) indicating that revefenacin is more effective than a placebo and comparably effective to tiotropium, a commonly prescribed LAMA that is taken via an inhaler, in reducing the rate of COPD exacerbations.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The market:\*\* COPD is quite common, affecting more than 65 million people worldwide. In the U.S., where about 15 million people have been diagnosed, COPD is the third most common cause of death. Despite these figures, there don't seem to be a whole lot of treament options for patients who prefer a nebulizer. The first and only (as far as I can tell) nebulized LAMA, a drug called \[glycopyrrolate\]([https://www.pharmacytimes.com/product-news/fda-oks-first-nebulized-lama-copd-treatment](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/product-news/fda-oks-first-nebulized-lama-copd-treatment)) (brand name LONHALA MAGNAIR), hit the market this year after the FDA approved it late last year. It must be taken twice per day, though. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any information about how well it has sold.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, tiotropium, the drug that Theravance tested revefenacin against in the Phase 3 trial described above, sells extremely well. Produced by Boehringer Ingelheim under the brand name SPIRIVA, it generated \[approximately $3B\]([http://annualreport.boehringer-ingelheim.com/fileadmin/user\_upload/BI\_Annual\_Report\_2017\_EN.pdf](http://annualreport.boehringer-ingelheim.com/fileadmin/user_upload/BI_Annual_Report_2017_EN.pdf)) in revenue for BI last year, despite the fact that some of the patents protecting SPIRIVA have expired. Especially in the U.S., there doesn't seem to be a lot of competition among bronchodilators for COPD.

&amp;#x200B;

Note that LAMAs are not the only treatment options for maintenance of COPD, but there is \[some evidence\]([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/resp.13100](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/resp.13100)) to suggest that they have fewer adverse effects than common alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The company:\*\* With a market cap of $1.3B, Theravance is a small company. It has one drug in production, an antibiotic called VIBATIV, and several others in development. Just prior to yesterday's earnings report, Theravance announced that they are selling VIBATIV to Cumberland Pharmaceuticals for $25M and ""tiered royalties of up to 20%"" (details forthcoming). They did this in order to focus their commercial efforts on marketing and selling revefenacin.

&amp;#x200B;

Theravance won't be going it alone, however. They have partnered with Mylan ($MYLN) for development and commercialization. So far Mylan has covered the costs of Phase 3 trials. If the drug is approved, Mylan and Theravance will share domestic production costs and profits earned. Outside the U.S., Mylan will produce and sell revefenacin and will pay royalties to Theravance. I haven't found many details about the arrangement, though.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Theravance Pharmaceuticals ($TBPH) is eagerly awaiting the FDA's decision on November 13th to approve or reject their new COPD drug, revefenacin. Clinical trials have demonstrated that it is more effective than a placebo and comparably effective to tiotropium, a similar drug used in inhalers. If it is approved, revefenacin will be the only once-daily, nebulized COPD drug of its kind. Theravance is apparently so confident that it will be approved that they sold their only drug in production to another company in order to focus their efforts on commercializing it.

The results of Phase 3 trials are not yet posted to the site, but Theravance \[has released some data\]([https://www.empr.com/drugs-in-the-pipeline/yupelri-revefenacin-lama-long-acting-muscarinic-antagonist-copd-exacerbations/article/796275/](https://www.empr.com/drugs-in-the-pipeline/yupelri-revefenacin-lama-long-acting-muscarinic-antagonist-copd-exacerbations/article/796275/)) indicating that revefenacin is more effective than a placebo and comparably effective to tiotropium, a commonly prescribed LAMA that is taken via an inhaler, in reducing the rate of COPD exacerbations.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The market:\*\* COPD is quite common, affecting more than 65 million people worldwide. In the U.S., where about 15 million people have been diagnosed, COPD is the third most common cause of death. Despite these figures, there don't seem to be a whole lot of treament options for patients who prefer a nebulizer. The first and only (as far as I can tell) nebulized LAMA, a drug called \[glycopyrrolate\]([https://www.pharmacytimes.com/product-news/fda-oks-first-nebulized-lama-copd-treatment](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/product-news/fda-oks-first-nebulized-lama-copd-treatment)) (brand name LONHALA MAGNAIR), hit the market this year after the FDA approved it late last year. It must be taken twice per day, though. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any information about how well it has sold.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, tiotropium, the drug that Theravance tested revefenacin against in the Phase 3 trial described above, sells extremely well. Produced by Boehringer Ingelheim under the brand name SPIRIVA, it generated \[approximately $3B\]([http://annualreport.boehringer-ingelheim.com/fileadmin/user\_upload/BI\_Annual\_Report\_2017\_EN.pdf](http://annualreport.boehringer-ingelheim.com/fileadmin/user_upload/BI_Annual_Report_2017_EN.pdf)) in revenue for BI last year, despite the fact that some of the patents protecting SPIRIVA have expired. Especially in the U.S., there doesn't seem to be a lot of competition among bronchodilators for COPD.

&amp;#x200B;

Note that LAMAs are not the only treatment options for maintenance of COPD, but there is \[some evidence\]([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/resp.13100](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/resp.13100)) to suggest that they have fewer adverse effects than common alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The company:\*\* With a market cap of $1.3B, Theravance is a small company. It has one drug in production, an antibiotic called VIBATIV, and several others in development. Just prior to yesterday's earnings report, Theravance announced that they are selling VIBATIV to Cumberland Pharmaceuticals for $25M and ""tiered royalties of up to 20%"" (details forthcoming). They did this in order to focus their commercial efforts on marketing and selling revefenacin.

&amp;#x200B;

Theravance won't be going it alone, however. They have partnered with Mylan ($MYLN) for development and commercialization. So far Mylan has covered the costs of Phase 3 trials. If the drug is approved, Mylan and Theravance will share domestic production costs and profits earned. Outside the U.S., Mylan will produce and sell revefenacin and will pay royalties to Theravance. I haven't found many details about the arrangement, though.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Theravance Pharmaceuticals ($TBPH) is eagerly awaiting the FDA's decision on November 13th to approve or reject their new COPD drug, revefenacin. Clinical trials have demonstrated that it is more effective than a placebo and comparably effective to tiotropium, a similar drug used in inhalers. If it is approved, revefenacin will be the only once-daily, nebulized COPD drug of its kind. Theravance is apparently so confident that it will be approved that they sold their only drug in production to another company in order to focus their efforts on commercializing it.

[DD] ACRX and DSUVIA: Everything You Need to Know,"I have a spare hour to kill so I'll help you beautiful people out.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is DSUVIA?**

DSUVIA is a newly approved drug designed to treat *acute, severe* pain. Its main ingredient is sufentanil (first synthesized in 1974), an opioid much stronger than morphine or even fentanyl. The exact numbers are inconsistent on major news sources, but it's generally assumed to be 500-1000x more powerful than morphine. It comes in the form of a 30 mcg tablet attached to a one-time use plastic applicator.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why DSUVIA?**

The only current alternative for fast relief for severe pain is IV morphine. However, setting up treatment includes the bag, stand, tube, needle, etc... you get the point. With the high healthcare costs in America, this is a costly method. On the flipside, there is no big process needed to use DSUVIA, you simply put the applicator under the patient's tongue. This would potentially cost a fraction of the price, and therefore an attractive alternative saving both money and time.

Furthermore, there are certain patients where an injection is unfavorable. For example, the elderly may not be able to get that pain relief without severe bruising. Burn victims may not respond well to shots either. Basically, this is a non-intrusive way to relieve pain.

&amp;#x200B;

**The downsides of DSUVIA**

DSUVIA is not a miracle drug, and should not be thought of as such. It is important to remember that it is an opioid, and a very potent one at that. There has already been significant news coverage blasting this product as the next harbinger of the ongoing epidemic. Even though I will explain why this may not be as big of a deal below, we all know how irrational the market can be, especially if a death is recorded that would bring huge amounts of fearmongering.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why the downsides may not matter**

Most opioid addictions come from prescription medications (i.e. the doctor gives you a script of oxys, and you get addicted and turn to heroin, etc.). DSUVIA is designed *solely* for emergency treatments such as hospitals, military applications, and ambulances. If supply can be kept under lock, reasonable use is possible. It's estimated that under 1% of addictions come from inpatient treatments, so if used responsibly, there is very little danger of this being circulated in black market drugs. It will *not* be sold as a prescription, so there will be near-zero use of this on the streets. The only real way to obtain this to sell would be to steal from a hospital.

Furthermore, this product is supported and funded by the DoD, who is looking for a good alternative for pain relief in military medicine. There is a chance that there will be a military contract in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final words**

DSUVIA is not a big miracle drug that will disrupt the industry forever. It is an opioid that has hospital and military applications, and fills a niche market where there are no current competitors. ACRX has estimated that this has a market of around $1b. If that appeals to you, you may want to take a look into this in the near future.

ACRX has its earnings date coming up very soon (11/7).",charsons,1541194680,1,24,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9todow/dd_acrx_and_dsuvia_everything_you_need_to_know/

**Tariff Pressure Continues, For Now -** Got another month until that meeting, plus recent spying charges (MU) + (highly speculative currently, discussed and silenced immediately on Weibo) China moving a shitton of troops to Taiwan area, more saber rattling I'm guessing

**Midterm Elections -** Timed volatility bomb; Mixing an already fearful market + guaranteed volatility = ""defensive panic selling""

**Unescapable Late Cycle Assrape -** Tax cuts, fiscal stimuli doesn't really help much anymore, only adds to inflationary pressure. Lowered forecasts/guidance all around

**Interest Rates** **-** Debt costs more to maintain, and harder to attain. Shits on economic activity like that hooker on my dick

The Bear Case: How low can we go?," If you look at the [NASDAQ Composite](https://imgur.com/Itz8xSN), I think we will at least drop to the February low of 6630. (I snapped this chart on Thursday) We found support on the 2018 Open and bounced off of it in the last 15 min of trading today.

&amp;#x200B;

**The February low will be a major support line, if we break that then it's a complete free fall.**

&amp;#x200B;

For the uninformed retards:

Don't listen to all the autists saying ""buy the dip."" This still has room to drop a lot lower. The selloff was triggered by rising interest rates and the Fed straight up saying ""we got a long way to go till we're neutral"". Trade war talks are stagnant with no resolution in sight, inflation rising, dollar strength rising (which is bad), housing and auto sales are declining, Italy going bankrupt, we're on the brink of sanctioning the Saudi's (leading to an increase in oil prices), global markets around us have been falling for months, we are finally starting to get dragged down with them. Also we are in a way overextended bull run and are naturally overdue for the end of the cycle. With this laundry list of bad news i'm kind of baffled at all the blind optimism I'm still seeing lately.

&amp;#x200B;

To the morons saying: ""but earnings were great this quarter!"" The market isn't reacting to strong earnings, of course things have been great up to this point. Majority of the companies who reported so far are lowering their guidance indicating slowing of the economy MOVING FORWARD. With all this uncertainty, rising bond yields look more attractive and will drain funds from equities. Simultaneously, it will make the debt of leveraged companies more expensive to repay.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally sold everything two weeks ago and have moved into SQQQ and ABX. SQQQ because most sectors have already been in decline for a while. They were just masked by the tech sector, primarily the FANG megacaps. FANG has been the main driver in this extended rally. Now that FANG is done, and the tech bubble is deflating, the market will not be able to stage a comeback without them. Tech flew the highest and will fall the hardest. ABX is for when shit really hits the fan, people finally accept what's going on and seek shelter in the oldest safe haven there is: gold. I'm not anti tech or FANG. I've ridden them to the top the last 4 years. You just have to accept that the tides are changing and you will drown trying to swim against the current.

&amp;#x200B;

Snap buy puts,"After the recent article about O’Hara leaving, this the start of a breaking point for Snapchat executives. The Executives have had enough and I predict that we will see more heads leave in the coming days/weeks. Spiegel once again demonstrates he has no idea on how to run a business and the only thing that might steady the share price is if they open up voting to share holders. However spiegel, being the arrogant and prideful man he is, will never do it. Ultimately the one thing holding back Snapchat is the CEO

FB estimates,"I projected 35% Revenue yoy growth, 20% earnings growth, and $1 billion more in SG&amp;A. The cost increase is 10% above the CFOs high range estimates (he said 50-60% higher, this $1b is 70% higher)

$13.94 billion in Revenue and $1.60 for Q3 EPS. 

For a full year valuation I project 2018 EPS at $7.14 and P/E at 24 for a Fair Value PPS of $171.36.

This is a bullish take on their potential Q3 numbers.

Holding calls I can post proof but my post history shows these fuckers bleeding out.

Mexico’s richest man (and formerly of the world) Carlos Slim started a $13 billion dollar airport in Mexico a couple of years ago. The new president (AMLO) is basically a communist. To fight “corruption”, AMLO canceled the airport to a new location, screwing over Slim and his clique. This will scare off foreign investors and will probably collapse Mexican economy. It’s said that Slim and all the investors involved will loose $13 BILLION DOLLARS. Immediately after the announcement, the Mexican Peso fell 2% in the Asian and European markets . The new president (AMLO) is scheduled to talk tomorrow morning which is going to affect even more.",DICK_STUCK_IN_COW,1540796239,1,31,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9saue5/mexican_stocks_dd/

Looking at TSLA after Q3,"\- Tesla made 1/3 of Ford's operating profit in Q3, but they have 1/20 their debt. 

\- Tesla is growing revenue 90% annually since IPO. Ford is ... not.

\- It is now disclosed that Musk is in a love triangle with Larry Page and Larry Ellison. That explains why Oracle and Google keep suing each other. They're competing for Musk's affection. It's only a matter of time before they donate their entire net worths to Tesla just to get noticed by senpai Musk.

\- Look at the chodes betting against Tesla: poor AND stupid. You going to take investment advice from little chodes who tweet as their full time job?

A couple of days later the stock's 50-Day SMA jumped back into the lower bound of the 200-Day SMA. AMZN is walking a fine line of tipping over the edge of a second Death Cross. The AH movement is pushing AMZN even closer to the point of another major selloff. This indicates a bearish stock. I foresee dark days for Amazon Shareholders in the near future.

Just wanna get a few of your opinions. This year has looked a different then the past few years with this whole market trending down lately. But with UPS $3-4 drop today I got a few January 18, 2019 $115 calls with break-even at like $117. This will require a 6.3% increase from its current position to hit that. With Amazon, Walmart and other retailers stepping up their online store offerings, this may be a great year for shipping companies. I'm looking at UPS over FDX and others because of the pattern I see in their stock. 

I'd love to hear some feedback from you guys, thoughts on trends etc. 

Position: 1/18/2019 $115 calls bought at $110.67.

Micron: Meme Stock or Opportunity of a Lifetime?," **Why I remain long Micron:**

I know Micron (MU) has become a meme stock, but it’s still my largest position &amp; I going to keep buying more every single week even if it continues to drop.

**Quarter 4 FY2018 Recap:**

Going back to their Q4 report, they lowered guidance. First and foremost, Micron’s tax rate is expected to increase from 2% to 12.8%. This is a drastic increase that was expected due to the next tax bill. On a proportional basis, I believe the tax rate alone will decrease EPS by about $0.34.

In addition to this, tariffs and CPU shortages became a big point of contention. It is hard to estimate an exact impact of tariffs, but I estimate this will reduce EPS by about $0.12 (even more if tariffs become 25% rather than 10%). Intel has three facilities making 14nm chips, and though Intel already spent $1bn on CAPEX, adding even more production takes time. This slow-down in production is a short-term loss for Micron as PC makers aren’t buying as many memory chips because of slowed production due to scarce CPU chips. Unfortunately, the weakened demand on Intel causing shortages is expected to last about 2 quarters.

Micron expects DRAM prices to up about 22% YoY and NAND to be up as much as 45% YoY for the remainder of 2018. For 2019, Micron expects DRAM bits to grow another 20% YoY and for NAND to slow the growth to only 40% YoY.

Micron believes that DRAM profit gross margin will remain strong, if not increase, while NAND supply will moderate itself due to 96L challenges (Sanjay touched on this during the call. Approx. 37:00). Micron will also actively work to produce 3D X-Point.

**IMFT and 3D-XPoint:**

Speaking of X-Point, Micron will now be acquiring the rights to IMFT which will make them the only producer of XPoint— this means they get to set the margins. 

If the announcement of the option to buy IMFT is such good news, why did Micron not jump on the news of IMFT acquisition?

First of all, they already owned 51%, but more importantly, as I understand it, WFE loses value quickly, and has less than ideal salvage value. If true, I'm not sure the $6 billion figure is terribly relevant.

After completing the acquisition, Micron will be the only company in the world that will have access to a FAB that develops XPoint technology. The FAB is located relatively close to Micron’s headquarters in Boise, Idaho, and all of the IMFT employees will become Micron employees, which also means they could help in the development of DRAM, NAND Flash, and even NRAM (which I previously stated that Micron is developing with Nanya).

They are essentially paying for the right to spend a few billion a year in PPE expenses for this FAB and likely still make solid ROE. Intel has never been very committed to memory (NAND loser and didn't bother in trying to get into DRAM) and likely allowed Micron this high ROE potential because they assumed lackluster outcomes and ten years ago were partnering with a Micron that was making $8 billion in revenue with sub-20% net margins. They figured if 3D-XPoint turned into something worth the capEX, they'd just pay enough for it that cash-flow restricted Micron would void the contract.

If you are convinced that MU will make $4 or less in '19 and/or '20 (as many investors who buy into the cyclical nature of memory apparently are), then that outweighs any good news in the interim. Awhile back, '18 was the year MU's earnings were going to collapse. Since that hasn't panned out for the bears, they rolled it out to '19-'20. If it doesn't happen then, they'll roll it out to '21. At some point MU will become too cash rich to not rise the SP (assuming no recession), but that's a couple of years away. That's why MU is dead money for the immediate future (unless SK Hynix reports significantly positive guidance about the aggregate memory market on 10/24).

Long term, I see 3D-XPoint DIMMs replacing almost 1/2 DRAM + plus expanding the market. This deal makes sense for Micron because they've got a working in-memory computational product ready for release in May 2019. Micron has a partnership with Amazon to supply 3D-XPoint Gen2 chips to major customer like DoD, FBI, and NSA.

This is a big, big, big deal for both Intel and Micron. As a shareholder, I am happy to trade 3 weeks worth of profits for years of R&amp;D into new technological advances.

**What is 3D-XPoint?**

3D-XPoint is a relatively new form of memory that is nonvolatile and is 1000x faster than a standard SSD, and has 10x the storage density of conventional memory. It can best be described as a hybrid mix between DRAM and NAND Flash memory.

[https://imgur.com/a/0Wrevag](https://imgur.com/a/0Wrevag)

3D-XPoint has the ability to write data at the bit level, which is a major advantage over NAND. This allows 3D-XPoint to have higher performance and lower power consumption than NAND Flash. This is done by being based on a phase-change memory technology with a transistor-less architecture.

**The Future of Micron with 3D-XPoint:**

I believe there is immense potential for 3D-XPoint going forward. It is relatively common to tier storage between HDDs and flash memory. High-intensity data applications that need high speeds are stored on the NAND memory, while data that is less frequently used is stored on the disk. 3D-XPoint is an additional layer of storage above flash for data and applications that need even greater speeds. I expect this technology to be used to high-performance storage and caching, but it has the potential to entirely replace memory as we know it. Users will be able to increase server memory by as much as 8x.

However, I believe we are still in the very early stages of 3D-XPoint. At the moment, XPoint chips are too expensive for mass adoption. For example, the Optane chip sells for [roughly $2500](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=0D9-002V-001S1&amp;ignorebbr=1&amp;nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC&amp;cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC-_-pla-_-Solid+State+Disk+-+Enterprise-_-0D9-002V-001S1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn9ug4tKS3gIVkddkCh2v9AijEAQYASABEgLMPvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds), which more expensive than most DRAM chips by a factor of 10.

Here’s the best part: since Micron will be the only producer of 3D-XPoint in the world at the time of their acquisition, they will have an exceptional profit margin due to lack of competition. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said, “Micron’s acquisition of IM Flash demonstrates our strong belief that 3D XPoint technology and other emerging memories will provide a unique differentiator for the company and be an essential solution for new data-hungry applications. This investment provides Micron with an established development and manufacturing facility and a highly skilled workforce with a strong track record of innovation and execution.""

Micron’s QuantX 3D-XPoint chips will hit the market in 2H CY2019.

I believe that 3D-XPoint is what PhysX Cards were to Nvidia. When first invented, PhysX was way ahead of its time, but it was too early for adoption. Then Nvidia came and bought the chips, and now PhysX is the staple for every Nvidia GPU.

**Is the Memory Market Declining?**

Obviously, the semiconductor sector is on fire. Forecasts for 2018 are more of the same, though maybe not as hot as 2017.

KPMG says “Semiconductor leaders expect 2018 to be another year of growth for industry revenues though the industry will be hard pressed to match the historic growth rate of 2017...Average Sales Price (ASP) erosion is still seen as the top industry issue for the next three years but by a slimmer margin than last year. Keeping pace with diverse customer demands jumped to number two this year.”

WSTS says that “we expect the world semiconductor market to grow in 2018 and 2019 to $463 billion and $484 billion respectively. For 2018, this represents growth of 12.4%. This reflects expected growth in all major categories, with an extraordinary growth from Memory at 26.5 percent followed by Analog ICs with 9.5 percent. In 2018, all geographical regions are expected to grow.”

IC Insights says that “The semiconductor industry’s forecast is brighter than originally thought. That was the conclusion of market research firm IC Insights on Wednesday, when it almost doubled the growth forecast for the semiconductor industry from eight to 15% in 2018...IC Insights now expects DRAM prices to increase 36% – significant given that the memory technology’s price jumped 81 percent last year. The price for NAND is forecast to increase 10 percent after jumping by 45% in 2017. The actual number of DRAM and NAND chips sold will grow only 1% and 6% respectively.”

[http://www.semi.org/en/fab-spending-poised-remarkable-fourth-year-growth](http://www.semi.org/en/fab-spending-poised-remarkable-fourth-year-growth)

Semi.org [could see FAB spending](http://www.semi.org/en/2019-prognostication) (that is, the construction of new plants) growing again in 2018, for a near-unprecedented three consecutive years.

[https://imgur.com/a/hxK3Qj5](https://imgur.com/a/hxK3Qj5)

That could also further lead to a truly unprecedented four-straight years of FAB growth.

Little wonder, then, that the record pace of investments through 2017 stoked speculation that traditional industry cycles could be changing. Historically, spending sees one- to two-years of growth followed by a downturn of roughly equal duration, setting up 2019 for a fab spending slowdown if historical norms play out.

However, now, one year later, SEMI’s World Fab Forecast data point to an improbable eye-watering fourth consecutive year of fab equipment spending growth to the tune of 5 percent.

[https://imgur.com/a/jJ7cXTJ](https://imgur.com/a/jJ7cXTJ)

When putting FAB spending on the same axis as aggregate revenue, we see that this carries an r2 value of 0.772, which is very strong.

[https://imgur.com/a/ZUrGURc](https://imgur.com/a/ZUrGURc)

So this shows us that an increase in FAB spending should lead to an increase in revenues, which should drive the stock prices higher even if the multiples aren’t changing. On this note, Intel is expected to spend $5bn in Israel this year ([https://www.anandtech.com/show/12774/intel-discloses-plans-to-spend-5-billion-on-israeli-fab-28](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12774/intel-discloses-plans-to-spend-5-billion-on-israeli-fab-28)). Micron Technology is opening a new facility in Singapore this year ([https://www.anandtech.com/show/12622/micron-starts-construction-of-third-nand-fab](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12622/micron-starts-construction-of-third-nand-fab)). Overall FAB spending in expected to see a 5% CAGR spending starting this year.

Inkwood Research sees the semiconductor market growing at 7.67% CAGR through 2024, ending with an $835bn market by then. In 2017, the semi market was $499bn with $364bn in sales. Discounting these numbers at the same rate (73%), this gives us $607bn.

Obviously the market is discounting that growth by a fair bit, with concerns of cyclicality and a drop off in prices. The semiconductor cycle is boom and then bust. We've clearly had some boom, but have we had it all?

Going into 2018, a KPMG survey found the semi cycle to be mostly expansionary still.

[https://imgur.com/a/GpP9MZt](https://imgur.com/a/GpP9MZt)

Recently, Merrill Lynch analyst Simon Woo visited South Korea (one of the biggest countries for memory) and had many positive things to say about the industry:

• CAPEX remains conservative for wafer fabrication equipment and incremental spending is mostly absorbed by shell fab construction.

• DRAM market is seeing low inventory levels for a few weeks. NAND inventories are behind by 4 weeks

ASP in 2019 should remain stable

• NAND ASP in the rest of CY18 should be smaller than expected

• Tariffs will have a minimal impact

• DRAM demand is solid (30-40% bit growth)

Take what I’m saying with a grain of salt because I’ve been buying since December 2016 (I also added more at $57), but this stock is way too cheap to pass up on now. Don’t buy your entire position all at once, but slowly average into 5-10% of your aggregate position now and keep adding. When XPoint production picks up (2H CY19) and starts being added to revenue, this stock could be at least $150 (really depends on how much revenue it brings in).

$REV - Short Squeeze in the Making,"Through all the volatility in the marketplace, REV - on no positive news - has been posting steady gains day over day since the 5th. All in all a \~30% increase.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a well written [thesis](https://moxreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Long-Rev-Sep-2018-Final.pdf) explaining the dynamics at play. \~85% of the shares have been accumulated by Perelman with an intent to go private. The majority of remaining shares are owned by Mittleman Brothers LLC who have explictly expressed intent to refuse any go private offers that do not reflect the intrinsic value of the stock - which they place in the range of $50.

&amp;#x200B;

With the vast majority of share owned by players with no intent to sell, the amount of trade-able shares / float is exceedingly small and shrinking. 2.7 million shares are shorted with a daily volume \~250K. As the major players increase their share in advance of going private, and others buy and hold in anticipation of a tender offer, traded shares continues to shrink.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that REV has continued to climb - from $20 on the 5th to $26 today without any signs of pullback despite a volatile market - underscores the extent price is being driven by these dynamics with the float. It would seem to be to Perelman's advantage to initiate a tender offer sooner, rather than later as this run-up increase. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is some threshold where a short squeeze will accelerate. With 30% sustained gains over the past two weeks, it is likely shorts covering positions are driving some of the existing movement already.

Long $TWLO,"Buy TWLO calls

Annual developer conference today and two new products Pay (securely process payments over phone w/Stripe being first partner) and AutoPilot (omnichannel bots) were introduced along with go live of flex platform which has oversubscribed demand

Guarantee you analysts will raise price targets tomorrow on the back of positive announcements at Signal conference. Pay partnership is with Stripe. Developers love Twilio

Stock has been hammered past two weeks due to global macro environment but fundamentals remain very strong

Twilio announced acquisition of sendgrid (leading email API platform) which basically rounds out the communications platform it offers. Email was the missing piece that people were wondering why Twilio doesn’t integrate and now they have it. Acquisition is via all-stock transaction. Despite this analysts remain bullish due to long term synergies and the fact that SendGrid userbase is different from Twilio’s which allows for cross selling opportunities 

Twilio build is a program for consulting/tech firms to help integrate Twilio with customers and spread awareness

Earnings date is scheduled for Nov 6 which is the day of the US house election. Twilio has developed an API for voting so there may be some parallels here between the two. 

Street Revenue estimates for Q3 aren’t even high and Twilio may blow past them given existing customers are spending more $ on increasing # of products 

TLDR: long TWLO calls expiring post earnings are the play here. Main risk is overall market selloff from worries around rising rates etc continuing causing tech shares to tumble further.  Twilio’s fundamentals are very strong and correction in past few weeks creates good buying opp. I also wrote a comment on here right before Q2 earnings predicting a major beat.

$JOE - Overlooked Casualty of Hurricane Michael,"$JOE is a REIT located with real estate almost entirely located in Bay County, Florida - precisely where the hurricane touched ground at its strongest. Compare the maps of the real estate holdings and hurricane path (map from [Investor Relations Slides](http://ir.joe.com/static-files/6dc1b47c-7416-4669-8a81-e049d9886009)).

A very thorough [sum-of-parts analysis](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-St.-Joe-Company-JOE.pdf) from earlier in the year placed a value of \~10 per share on the company. It currently stands at 15 per share. Hurricane Michael potentially serves as a strong catalyst for the price to drop to this target. Damage and short and long term implications from the hurricane likely make a substantially lower target more realistic- i.e. businesses and residents of areas hardest hit by natural disasters often [relocate](https://www.npr.org/2016/08/26/491531827/after-hurricane-sandy-many-chose-to-move-rather-than-rebuild), plans for new developments can be expected to be delayed, and the desirable of the location to retirees - a key demographic for the area - is likely to take a [hit](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/14/some-retirees-are-rethinking-florida-post-irma.html).

Whats more:

\- $JOE owns non-trivial timber assets and land dedicated to harvesting timber. Per there annual report: ""...we do not insure our timber assets and we self-insure home warranty claims. Additionally, our insurance for hurricanes is capped at $50.0 million per named storm and is subject to deductibles.""

\- Fairholme Funds $FAIRX is the largest shareholder - and conversely $JOE forms the largest position in $FAIRX. The fund has been making news for infamously betting big on Sears $SHLD. The open-ended fund has experienced massive divestment in recent years - the demise of Sears can only cast a further shadow on the credibility of the fund and continued divestment can only be expected. This has serious implications for the float - it would take approximately 6 months for the fund to unwind its $JOE position without adversely affecting the share price. Due to new liquidity regulations beginning in Dec and continued divestment - the fund may not have the luxury of unwinding at that extended pace.

The company typically has very little earnings - EPS forecast is .05 for the quarter - and nothing on the horizon that portents a substantial change. Interest rate hikes and an end-of-cycle real estate market are likewise problematic.

Once shareholders come to terms with the short-term and long-term implications of these developments there may be a rapid correction. In sum - there are many negative catalysts, and very little positive to counter it.

AMC is about to obliterate earnings,"Think about it HMNY has essentially been funding people to go to AMC for months now. Every time someone uses Moviepass to go to an AMC cinema, AMC gets paid in full. In addition, they've recently released their own subscription A-List which is catching all the disenchanted Moviepass users.

The stock pulled back a lot in 2017 which largely coincided with the rise of moviepass. However, Moviepass is honestly the best thing to ever happen to AMC. People are going to theaters at higher rates than ever before. I fully expect them to be back at ATH soon.

Also, Better Call Saul just finished its latest season and Breaking Bad is still the best show of all time.

SNP DD,"  China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (ticker SNP), also know as Sinopec is a Chinese diversified Oil &amp; Gas company, that plays in several spaces including, exploration &amp; production, refining, marketing &amp; distribution, and chemicals. Think of SNP as if Exxon Mobile and Honeywell had a baby and that baby was Chinese. 

But what's the opportunity? SNP has lost \~20% of its' value since the beginning of October and presents an excellent buying opportunity. First, SNP trades at 9x forward earnings and after this month's sell off the stock yields 10%, but these aren't the real reasons to buy this stock. The real reason to buy this stock is that as a conglomerate, SNP has the potential to unlock enormous value by breaking up and selling off (through IPOs) portions of its' business. It already has plans to IPO its' marketing and distribution units. This is truly a ""the parts are greater than the whole"" story. Individually, each of the units stand to fetchfar higher multiples than the what the stock currently trades at. Furthermore, SNP stands to benefit from secular tailwinds in oil &amp; gas prices. I am long shares of SNP.

TLDR; SNP stands to benefit greatly through divestitures, and pays you 10% while you wait. Also, once the Trump / Saudi war begins $200 oil will only serve to bolster SNP's stock price. Also the Dollar has topped... trust me.",MTGE,1539637404,1,13,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9ogt25/snp_dd/

Earnings on 10/18 will be another surprise gain so get in your 10/19 calls. I'm all in on multiple call levels, you can choose your risk but I expect a double digit gain. If for some reason I don't hit I will double down for future gains that 100% will be there, I'm targeting $40+. 

The stock is extremely undervalued compared to its AUM growth which is going to continue to grow exponentially. There is also a large amount of unrealized value from current assets which will only further make this a buy.

$BX LONG - DD,"The Blackstone Group (worlds largest real estate equity firm) will be launching 3 more major fundraisers, 1 by year end and 2 in early 2019. Only one of these has been announced to possibly be taking place, you will have to take my word on it.

The stock is extremely undervalued compared to its AUM growth which is going to continue to grow exponentially. I see the stock going to 40+ in a couple of months and even higher once its unrealized value in its current assets kicks in.

$CNI and $CP - post-correction rebound easy money play,"Transcript from DD research call:

$CNI will be a $135 dollar stock after earnings (Oct 23rd) 

Billions in capital investment has boosted an already huge profit margin &amp; is aiming for 50pc

Key Date in 2019 when Electronic Driver Logs become mandatory for drivers... all the drivers running long miles illegally will get shut down (just happened in the us causing over the road pricing to go up 35 percent within 1 month) this quickly shifted capacity to the rail causing the current spike in earnings

That was a US ELD Implementation, these are Canadian companies. The Canadian ELDs is going to destroy the highway market to the benefit of rails.

Yea I dont see it until 2027ish But I will be monitoring The rails are gonna explode the next 3-5 years

That was US and cross border Canadian drivers only And that was enough to increase the over the road price by 35 percent.

Volumes shifted to the rail line causing the recent surge in earnings (plus the economy being a bigger factor potentially)

Now for Canadian domiciled drivers it's happening in 2019 at the end.

That impacts long mile drivers the most. Canadian rails are all about long miles and can absorb all the additional over the road capacity.

Will grow from volumes going from road to rail + when the road prices spike say 30 percent (competition for drivers and increasing wages = same profit percent for road companies but higher revenue) the rail also increases price 25 percent but with the same input costs

Will take 6-12 months for the earnings spike after the ELD date

Rails are getting faster too. Takes 2.75 days for a team of 2 east indians to drive from Toronto to Calgary in 1 truck. Cost =5500. It now takes the rail 3.5 days and costs 3300

Down from 5 days 2 years ago. And the drivers are making maybe 5 percent bottom line vs the rails 35 percent.

CP

Back story - the rail needs local drivers near each terminal to pickup on their chassis and containers to ingate the train at the terminals

Makes sense?

CNs drivers are all unioned. CP has historically contracted out all of the drayage (the act of picking up and bringing the container to the rail)

In order to gain market share from CN, CP has done this as a cost plus through - accounting for about 20 percent of the cost of the rail move

So they were 5 percent lower than CN. Rails are at capacity now So at start of this quarter they increased the drayage price to be for profit So \~20 percent of their revenue was at cost Now it's at 40 percent margin

Cnr didnt get this advantage because they were running it with CN unionized drivers

A big component of the rails revenue comes from grain, bulk services, oil and partnerships with the ocean lines

I dont understand that stuff much I cant see tariffs being good for ocean lines coming from Asia and the EU though

A lot of our pricing with the rail is setup to get containers positioned back in Vancouver and Halifax and that hasnt shifted so that is my leading indicator to if something is fked from those revenue streams. Which is something but not enough

You can talk about the capital investments cp has made with new tracks and hoppers and rail cars

Also effective this quarter they retired the daily train line gta &gt; qc. It was profitable as a percentage (over 50) but low revenue. They allocated all that capacity and assets and yard space to long haul runs to western Canada. Lower margin but much higher revenue. Overall profit increase.

Gta &lt;&gt; QC\*

They retired it in the previous quarter but the benefit in capacity not released until this quart

Also they have expanded there operation in Chicago to actually be functional. They did not have drayage contracts in place so clients needed to use there own drayage services to connect to the Chicago line. Now they have drayage partners in place and are actually marketing the area.

"Midterms , G20, and the Economy","As you read this post I ask you to please attempt to set aside any political biases you may have and instead observe the events and my prediction in a purely capitalistic financial fashion. The month of November is set to be massive as earnings season, trade wars, and elections will all come together to create an electric environment full of uncertainty and variance. The economy now faces major roadblocks that could lead to record growth or massive correction. Here is my prediction

&amp;#x200B;

1. Midterms

&amp;#x200B;

There is no doubt Wall Street is paying extra attention to Nov 6th and in my opinion, the market favors a Republican-controlled Congress. Not only does this scenario provide stability and avoid gridlock we know that future plans including deregulation and tax cuts will serve to increase profits on wall street. On the other hand, a Democratic victory in the house will serve to slow down any of those plans increasing roadblocks and uncertainty as for the partiosion divide increases to record levels. Although chances are low a Democratic victory in the Senate and House will likely cause a massive disruption to the market as the Democrats will seek impeachment preventing any chance of future tax cut or deregulation plans.

&amp;#x200B;

2. G20 and the trade war

&amp;#x200B;

If the Republicans keep control and win swiftly during Midterms this will set up a perfect scenario where a trade deal with China could take place at the G20 summit in Argentina in late Nov., Statements by Cui (Chinese ambassador the US) show that they are open to talks and comments by Larry Kudlow only seem to further this theory. In the end, a deal with favor both as long as a balanced deal can be made to look like a win in both countries and the heads of state can return home and present the deal as a win. Both economies are set to boom, and both leaders can push public momentum on their side 

&amp;#x200B;

Strategy 

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to Nov 6th (Election Day) 

\-Increase Cash and buy GDX (Current price 20.17)

\-Sell GDX Nov 5th end of day 

 

1. Full Republican Senate &amp; House control 

 \- Buy China 

 \- Buy FANG

&amp;#x200B;

2. A Republican win and Senate Democratic control in House

&amp;#x200B;

\- Buy China 

\- Buy FANG after a dip

\- Buyback GDX after a dip 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. Full Democratic Win - Senate and House Control 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Buy SQQQ Hold weekly and sell Friday until Dec

USO DD for the Week of Oct 15 - 19,"Hey everyone, expecting some decent price movement this week in the oil market. Some new developments that are coming to light that should add some volatility, so let's dive right into it. First let's have quick recap of last week.

As I empathized in my previous post, many emerging markets, such as India, are starting to show negative economic impacts caused by higher oil prices, higher interest rates, and growing global trade tensions. The effect being demand destruction for the oil market which was ultimately reflected in the EIA short term outlook report, OPEC monthly report, and IEA monthly global report who all lowered their demand outlooks for 2018 and 2019. Additionally, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also voiced their concerns about what higher oil prices would do to the global economy.  The Weekly EIA report also showed a massive crude build of about 6 million barrels, exports were still down but ultimately the build this week was due to low refinery utilization rates due to it being maintenance season. This is a seasonal occurrence and is ultimately expected this time of year. From a TA perspective WTI Crude bounced off the 9 week EMA around $70.66, which has served as support in the past. Now let's talk about this week.

As I've mentioned previously, the EIA weekly crude report is always a week behind so the impact hurricane Michael had on gulf rigs should show up in the report this week. Ultimately as much as 49% of gulf rigs were either evacuated or shut in place at one point. Rigs started doing this on Monday and didn't start firing back up again until Friday with rigs still starting back up through today. A decrease anywhere between 2 to 3.5 million barrels could have occurred, additionally, there will probably some kind of draw with gasoline as people were most likely prepping for the storm (something we saw with hurricane Francis).

Now the juicy bit of news that will probably add the most volatility this week: the Saudi's and the murdered Journalist. I have a link of it [here](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.usatoday.com/story/1639987002). Now originally I didn't pay much attention to it due to Trump's friendly relationship with the royal courts of Saudi Arabia and his lack of concern of human rights over economics, but nowwwww it appears he is siding with other countries in somewhat blaming the Saudi's for the missing journalist. Well Saudi Arabia does not take criticism well, as we have seen in the past after Canada's Foreign minister criticized the kingdom over human rights, and has ultimately threatened to withhold it's oil supply. Now that is very concerning as almost all of OPEC's current spare capacity comes from Saudi Arabia, meaning oil prices could sky rocket. I think in the long run, Trump would likely try and avoid this, but this is just the kind of speculation bulls can use to push oil prices up for the week.

So I'll likely look at 15.0 and 15.5 calls (FD) this week. As always, I will update more later.",GeoDudeBroMan,1539534298,1,212,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9o40nt/uso_dd_for_the_week_of_oct_15_19/

the nail in the SNAP coffin,"(Tried to make an account today for this post, too impatient for the 7 day wait, so I'm posting this from my moms account, please go easy, lol)

Hey guys,

It is me, your average WSB shmoe, side trading on Robinhood with bigger things on the horizon. Like a lot of you I check this sub for news or tips or to calm myself. I didn’t feel like I had advice until now, this will be my one and only post. Today I’d just like to share my story of my relationship with the app Snapchat.

Snapchat came out when I was a junior in High School, I was the target audience at the time, and we all know how the early days of SNAP went. Sexting was at the core, but like Facebook’s early days, it was able to circumference some key psychological landscapes, we all tend to forget SNAPs original monopoly. It was way easier for boys to ask girls for their snapchats than their numbers. A less formal setting for talking to people you wouldn’t normally be able to talk to. All of a sudden, people from different cliques and social statuses at school were interacting. SNAPs beginning was really strong, a large majority of people considered it their favorite social media, and rightfully so. **Even then,** **I did not like Snapchat**.

I had it like everyone else, I wasn’t an avid user, but I used it here and there. Their first updates were good for the app, streaks and stories, but for me the light quickly faded, and I deleted it and didn't look back. SNAP is what I like to call a 'Purely Social Media.' Facebook you got events, shows, birthdays, it’s not something you spend time on but you *check*. Instagram gave us the freedom of aesthetic, you could represent who you were to the world, whether you uploaded your art, photos you took, or told people how simple you were. Instagram and Facebook have evolved throughout the years, the time spent and what we spend it on has changed greatly. What people do on SNAP has not changed, **which is** **nothing**.

All these years, I’ve kept up with SNAP in the background. The IPO, Kylie’s tweet, and other random news. My brother turned me on to Robinhood two months ago, when I joined I saw snap at $12.00, and checking the history of the stock made perfect sense to me. Had I known at the time that I could bet against Snapchat, I’d be basking in some autistic gains right now, and when I finally discovered options, I made the only bet I’ve been sure about so far, which is **SNAP puts** baby.

Now, I’m not telling you to buy puts or calls, I am only asking to you to understand that **Snapchat died a long time ago**. Even with all those users, Snapchat's original purpose has faded, I’ve never seen anything become so useless in my entire life. I’ve heard that they've only made the app worse, my friends attest to using it less and less, all the DD, the glassdoor reviews, the executives leaving the company. I believe Snapchat is a rare WSB anomaly, this app cannot be jinxed. I know anything can happen on the market, but I want to confirm what a lot of you already know, whether it’s tomorrow, or ER, or a few months from now, the only place left for SNAP to go is **to the mother fucking Earth’s CORE**. Even if it goes back up, **it is going down**.

The people who cockily posted their Snapchats on Instagram when IG stories first came out remind me a lot of the people buying SNAP calls right now, voicing for something that they know deep down is not what they believe. The real fear for me is a buyout, a temporary boost wiping out all the gains, I don’t know what happens to puts during a buyout, I’ll let the comment section help me out there. Thank you to all the weak hands out there, more for the rest of us.

Good luck everyone.

DD: Why you should get out of the Recreational Cannabis Industry,"**TLDR of the full** [DD](https://medium.com/@pab.portes/why-you-shouldnt-invest-in-cannabis-right-now-24f06f51480)

**Legislation**

Recreational cannabis is becoming legal on October 17th in Canada as per the Cannabis Act but with restrictions:

\- Over 18-19 only (with Quebec even mentioning 21 when the biggest consumer segment is 18-25)

\- Only allowed to own or share 30 grams at a time

\- Concentrated products still banned for a year

\- Heavy regulation on what you are allowed to do to advertise and no major event sponsorship.

\- Only products from licensed growers bought from licensed resellers are allowed (120 licenses so far with **87 issued as recently as 2017. Young companies = more risk of bad management**)

\- Strictly forbidden to take Cannabis across borders (meaning the Canadian market will behave as a closed market for the foreseeable future). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Current market size and growth estimate:**

I made a projection model for the recreational Cannabis Industry (**RCI**) based on: (excel spreadsheet available in the full DD):

\- Medium Population Growth scenario from the Gov. of Canada

\- Age distribution evolution over time in Canadian population from the Gov. of Canada.

\- Percentage of Cannabis users in over 18 population

\- Average number of use days amongst cannabis users (user types)

\- Average quantity of Cannabis used per use days 

\- Reported intentions of switching to the legal RCI depending on user type (casual or more than 3 times a week)

\- Average Gross Profit for the biggest Cannabis companies

\- Planned government taxation

\- Planned Cannabis retail price on October 17 and price decreasing at a similar rate to other places where Cannabis was legalized

\- I estimated casual users would double their usage for the first year only to account for hype, cross selling and tourism (frequent users can hardly increase their usage since most are already reporting they use cannabis every day).

**Limits of the model:** real switch to the RCI can vary, reported usage can be lower than actual usage (for example, when asked how much they spend on pharmaceutical cannabis, customers say 124 $ per month when real number is closer to 122$ per month), population growth and socio-economic climate can change. This model does not consider bulk discounts and possible evolution in legislation.

From that model I built 3 different scenarios playing on the growth of cannabis users in the population (using usage statistics since 1961). The low growth scenario is based on the stable periods since 1961 (+0.125% additional users per year). The medium growth scenario is based on the growth of the past 5 years (+1% additional users per year) and the high growth scenario is based on the 70s and the end of the 90s (+2.5% additional users per year).

Using these numbers total TONS of cannabis sold between 2018 and 2023 should be between 1115.8719 tons and 1583.12214 tons. This would mean gross profit after taxes but before management expenses **between 5.08 Billion CAD$ and 6.89 Billion CAD$ for the LEGAL RCI between 2018 and 2023.** Although it is still an amazing number for a young industry, this is much, much lower than the combined Market cap of the 5 biggest cannabis firms which is currently sitting over **32 Billion CAD$. This valuation does not even account for all of the other weed stocks.**

This valuation makes no sense whatsoever even when being generous with the growth estimates and there are other problems with the industry...

&amp;#x200B;

**There are 3 main growth avenues for the RCI:** 

1) **Increasing percentage of users who switch to the legal markets** (currently 69% of casual users and 47% of frequent users). This is going to be very tough because the gov. shot itself in the foot by not opening a path to rehabilitate current actors in the illegal industry. Both large and small players in the black market will continue to sell their products because they are barred from legal licenses and determining if what someone smokes is legal or not will be close to impossible. The black market is already offering CHEAPER PRICES (7.5$/g vs 8.5$/g aimed by legal retailers) and better service (home delivery and possibility to buy more than one ounce at a time which is illegal in the legal RCI). 

2)**Increasing frequency of use amongst users:** Difficult because of regulation, because concentrated products and edible are still banned from sales for a year and because the current usage frequency is already high (18% of daily users and 33% already saying they use cannabis at least 3-4 times a week) and growth is difficult. Usage frequency growth is also capped in the future due to health concerns and gov. commitment to launch campaigns to lower use.  

3)**Increasing the overall percentage of users:** This is going to be the most difficult for companies due to heavy regulations on what they are allowed to do to advertise their products. This is most likely where the competing alcohol industry and anti drug groups will fight back the most because there is no regulation about criticizing cannabis (=cheaper and easier to launch smear campaigns than to advertise cannabis). Also, even during the 70s and early 90s which were the two periods with the highest user growth, it amounted only to about **+2.5% of population** becoming new users per year and these users are unlikely to be heavy users straight from the start.

Cannabis companies could also increase gross margin by raising prices but since they are already planning to be more expensive than black market cannabis, they have little wiggle room if they want to have a lot of customers using the legal industry.

&amp;#x200B;

**“Unrealized gain on revaluation of biological assets”:** 

Cannabis companies all use specific accounting practices originally made to protect farmers against fluctuating prices to fluff up their results sheet. By playing on the future supposed value of their biological assets you get strange situations where for example: Chronos Group reports **7.23 Million CAD$ in gross profit** when **they only report 4.08 Million CAD$ in product sales** (they say their cost of sales is negative due to ""fair value of biological assets inventory). In the notes of their annual report they also state **a 5% decrease in cannabis price** (from a supposed starting point of 8.5$ per g) **would decrease biological asset value by 18.59% and inventory value by 36.28%**. A small decrease in plant yield would also have significant impact on their inventory value. 

Cannabis companies also rely on massive dilutions to raise cash or complete acquisitions and all of the 5 biggest companies saw their shares at least double in the last 2 years (4x for Aurora). This is bad for long term holders if it continues.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final recommendations:**

**I would heavily recommend NOT TO INVEST in Canadian RCI at the current market valuations** and will probably open a short position a couple quarters after legalization. If you are already invested and want to stay in, keep a close eye on the usage statistics once we get actual sales result and **most importantly the percentage of users actually switching to the legal industry**.

I am bullish long term on the sector but closed my position for now. In my opinion some of the decisions by the Canadian gov. will heavily slow down the sector until they reassess their policies because they are limiting the growth options and gave out too many permits to the wrong people.  Lack of transparency in the industry (recent Canopy massive crop failures) and borderline corrupt government permit issuance (ex anti-drug cops getting growing and sales permit in Ontario) give a bad short term vibe on the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR OF THE TLDR: GET OUT OF CANNABIS BEFORE ACTUAL USAGE RESULT COME OUT AND DON'T OPEN A NEW POSITION NOW BECAUSE THE CANADIAN GOV. FUCKED UP and because the industry is super overvalued and uses dubious accounting practices and lacks transparency. Cannabis stock market is a giant game of hot potatoes where some companies will be extremely profitable but most will fail in the medium term.**

the nail in the SNAP coffin,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

It is me, your average WSB shmoe, side trading on Robinhood with bigger things on the horizon. Like a lot of you I check this sub for news or tips or to calm myself. I didn’t feel like I had advice until now, so I made this account for my one and only post. I can tell there is one stock on a lot of your minds, a hot topic of this sub, and today I’d just like to share my story of Snapchat.  

Snapchat came out when I was a junior in High School, I was the target audience at the time, and we all know how the early days of SNAP went. Sexting was at the core, but like Facebook’s early days, it was able to circumference some key psychological landscapes, we all tend to forget SNAPs original monopoly. It was way easier for boys to ask girls for their snapchats than their numbers. A less formal setting for talking to people you wouldn’t normally be able to talk to. All of a sudden, people from different cliques and social statuses at school were interacting. SNAPs beginning was really strong, a large majority of people considered it their favorite social media, and rightfully so.  Even then, **I did not like Snapchat**.

I had it like everyone else, I wasn’t an avid user, but I used it here and there. Their first updates were good for the app, streaks and stories, but for me the light quickly faded. I deleted it after high school, I was gone from the app at a time where everyone still used it. The term I used for Snapchat was “Pure Social Media.” Facebook you got events, shows, birthdays, it’s not something you spend time on but you *check*. Instagram gave you the freedom of aesthetic, you could represent who you were to the world, whether you uploaded your art, photos you took, or told people how simple you were. Instagram and Facebook have evolved throughout the years, the time spent and what we spend it on has changed greatly. What people do on Snap has not changed, **which is** **nothing**.

All these years, I’ve kept up with SNAP in the background. The IPO, Kylie’s tweet, and other random news. My brother turned me on to Robinhood two months ago, when I joined I saw snap at $12.00, and checking the history of the stock made perfect sense to me. Had I known at the time that I could bet against Snapchat, I’d be basking in some autistic gains right now, and when I finally discovered options, I made the only bet I’ve been sure about so far, which is **SNAP puts** baby.

Now I’m not telling you to buy puts or calls, I am only asking to you to understand that **Snapchat died a long time ago**. Even with all those users, SNAPs original purpose is faded, I’ve never seen anything become so useless in my entire life. I’ve heard they’ve only made the app worse, my friends attest to using it less and less, all the DD, the glassdoor reviews, the executives leaving the company. Snapchat is a rare WSB anomaly, this app cannot be jinxed. I know anything can happen on the market, but I want to confirm what a lot of you already know, whether it’s tomorrow, or ER, or a few months from now, the only place left for SNAP to go is to the **mother fucking Earth’s CORE**. Even if it goes back up, **it is going down**.  
 

The people who cockily posted their Snapchats on Instagram when IG stories first came out remind me a lot of the people buying SNAP calls right now, voicing for something that they don’t even realize is not something they believe in. The real fear is a buyout, a temporary boost wiping out all the gains, I don’t know what happens to puts during a buyout, I’ll let the comment section help me out there. Thank you to all the weak hands out there, more for the rest of us.

Good luck everyone.",elti_the_grey,1539278619,1,1,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9nbyie/the_nail_in_the_snap_coffin/

Take note of the treasury auction dates...,,moist_technology,1539229138,1,18,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9n6h5n/take_note_of_the_treasury_auction_dates/
Market sell off mimics the vix spike of February with bonds and equity sell off. Short vol made the drop much larger but isn’t what pushed it over the edge. Long Financials,"I think this past week was sparked by expected interest rate hikes, mixed with very high valuations across the board. 

The ten year yield is now up to 3.23. 

Similar to how a good jobs report cause fear of fed rate hikes in February sparked a sell off that was compounded by the increasingly large AUM of short vol funds and etf’s. I think this one was the expectation that the fed doesn’t plan to slow rate hikes, compounded by high valuations led to this sell off. 

At the end of the day only one sector is helped by interest rate hikes and that’s banks. Going long on some of the banks, I think they’ll be the first to bounce back. Unless there’s a debt crisis in the near future that I’m not seeing I think retail banking will be the first to bounce back",antifrgl01,1539211927,1,40,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9n4eey/market_sell_off_mimics_the_vix_spike_of_february/

When Random Autistic WSB DD actually goes your way,"So after observing TLRY, I was searching for the next one. Found that random guy shilling REV calls and obviously bought 11/16 calls for a total of $170 (actual value, not contract value). It was worth $20 a few weeks ago, $40 until yesterday. Suddenly some director picks up a shitload of shares today, sent the stock up 20% and I broke even and sold. Bought puts at the top, up 48% on it today and the stock is now down 17% AH.

The brazilian big short," Yo, **I just bought approx 40% of my whole portfolio in PBR puts for november**, why?

Consider the following: PBR has been in complete euphoria since Bolsonaro, a Brazilian candidate for presidency, showed up leading the polls in complete commotion, everyone thought of him as the Brazilian Trump. He chose a Chicago economic analyst as economic advisor, he said he'll make everything private, the market loved it.

The second candidate is less fortunate, it's called Fernando Haddad, he's a member of the workers party (PT), and has leftist inclinations. Also the market completely hates him.

He will win the presidency, why?

First, the euphoria has overwhelmed the prices and is completely off the charts, non justified and should see a correction nonetheless. Second, Bolsonaro doesn't have Trump's speech, he's way dumber (oh yeah) and is incapable of debating. He'll debate a Master in economics (Haddad has a PhD in Philosophy by a Canadian college and a Master in Economics by a top college in Brazil) without being able to speak properly like a full grown adult. The 26%'s Haddad got, all the other candidates had left wing inclinations as well, they'll all migrate. I proceed to see a scenario where Haddad wins Bolsonaro. Not only that is NOT in the prices, it'll make the whole brazilian market FUCKING IMPLODE. I bought OTM cheap put options. If he's elected, I'm going to Caribe.

Spotify valuation of 30B while total music sales in 2017 were 17.3B,"The company has a stagnant market share in streaming of about 60%. Streaming currently makes up 40% of music sales, but will likely reach 70% within the next   
decade. In the US, streaming is already 65%. Spotify has no original content or unique barriers to entry, so their margins will continue to be pressured by larger companies who use streaming as a loss leader, like Apple, Google, and Amazon. In order to justify their current valuation of 30B, they would need to control 100% of music sales and manage to gain a 6% profit margin: 18B \* .06 = 1B \* PE of 30. A PE this high would also be hard to justify in such a slow growing and volatile industry. Spotify is expected to have a roughly -9% profit margin this year, so improving this to 6% without sacrificing market share is hard to imagine.

XLK Calls - Semi-lengthy DD,"Maybe I’m a big dumbass, but this seems like a great dip to buy for the tech sector (even if it continues). Even more so for the stocks that the XLK represents (SPDR tech sector fund, with shit ass FB and all that recently removed).

Top 7 holdings of the XLK:
-Apple 20.49%
-Microsoft 16.91%
-Visa 5.1%
-Intel 4.34%
-Cisco 4.32%
-MasterCard 3.86%
-Nvidia 3.32%

Also ADBE, IBM... just look it up.

All stuff pretty much careening down from ATHs this week, or dropping with the whole market. 

I’m have instanced (and will further instance if the dip keeps dippin’) **XLK $75C 11/2s**. Here’s how I’ve gauged the play:

Pros (I think):
-if Kavanaugh gets confirmed for SC (as this will add stability to market, seems he will be confirmed tomorrow)
-if Brazil favors Bolsonaro in the election this weekend (should go to a run-off at EoM, but any more gain of a lead will likely help the emerging markets bullshit)
-if Italy chills
-if you think any earnings run-up occurs this month (check that shit, October is spicy)
-if you think AAPL sells the XR well

Cons:
-opposites of the above
-tech might have been quite inflated and now might be closer to actual InTrInSiC VaLuE
-yields continue to moisten folks away from equities/make debtors poorer
-China does some hacking shit
-Trump tweet storm
-unplanned weekend terror

I favor the Pros, and trust in the major holdings of the XLK running up, especially those with such big catalysts in October. Thoughts?

Mercadolibre a $300 stock that moves like a penny stock,"[https://imgur.com/a/I2p12Sq](https://imgur.com/a/I2p12Sq)

okay i've recently discovered  a wonderful stock to play play options on its mercadolibre $meli the stock easily moves 10 dollars a day has wide spreads and right now because of the market sell of today its a good day to buy it.

the options for it are really great to play personally i believe the it finished it correction and will go back up again next week. 

the options are good on it because the iv almost never drops and usually just keeps on going this up and because the price value depends on so many factors, trade, politics, foreign exchange rates ect.. the stock will not iv drain you.  

there isnt much newswise about the stock technicals the stock had a low pull back correction meaning that it the volume is only 200k out 800k 3 month average.

&amp;#x200B;

basically this stock moves 20 and up to 40 dollars per day easily so just enter at a low and you'll be able to exist at a high sooner or later. its a fun meme stock the most wbs can afford 

stock has support at $340 and resistance at $375

&amp;#x200B;

rsi is still at over bought levels but is approaching 51 which means it still could reserve stock is also above the 200 and 50 day exponential moving average and usually bounces from them",Ragepower529,1538678313,1,30,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9lem2y/mercadolibre_a_300_stock_that_moves_like_a_penny/

Excelsior Mining Company - MIN.TO / EXMGF,"Have an open mind, if this a penny stock bullshit, I’ll delete. 

I received this tip from a CPA on plane from Palm Springs. Company’s name is Excelsior Mining Company based out of Arizona, traded on the OTCQX.

They have developed a new mining strategy which involved water acidic treatment of copper reserves deep in the ground. The process is called “in-situ” is minimally invasive and involves water pumping and treatment to extract copper in the ground.

Excelsior was facing regulatory approval on their two sites in Arizona and just received both approvals from the EPA in late August.

They have tremendous bench strength with a former congressman and multiple PHDs and CPAs. 

It’s trading at .75 USD and they should report Q3 in November. I believe mining operations have begun and if you can sit on your investment for 12 months, I believe this has boom potential.

Copper is $2.81 / lb

  I don't think there's any market GM is competitive in anymore, their design is fucking awful. the only people who own GM's are trailer trash. they came out with the volt I'm pretty sure that's failed because I've only actually seen a couple of them. everytime I see a chevy it's someone smoking a cigarette with the window up. they're failing in the truck market , losing to ford. but now with the intruduction of Japanese trucks in the large truck scene I think they're going to fail some more. Nissan and Toyota are breaking into the full size diesel truck market and I think they're killing it.  at any rate I think GM is a garbage company, they've failed before and I think they're likely to fail again. this time I doubt there's a possibility of another bailout.

I don't know much about researching the companies on how to decide whether or not to get puts. but GM is down 15.14% in the last year, and 14.56% in the last 3 months.. I started looking at open interest and there's much more open interest on the PUT side, throughout all weeks even going into march. an example of that would be December 21st 2018  , the open interest for 33$ puts is 29,759 on the Call side the highest open interest is 37$ calls at 4,345.

&amp;#x200B;

so I'm going to get a few 33$ puts

It's currently sitting at $27.69 with current premium at $.05 for 10/19 $29. If these move up even $.20 you're printing tendies. Doesn't need to hit the strike for you to be successful and it cannot go down too much anyways.  It's been moving down for the last month possibly due to fears of the interest rate hike being bigger than projected. Fears should be P R I C E D I N now and everything can keep moving up again, right?  I also read some other shit on SA, Zachs, etc. that did not convince nor dissuade me.

Activision $ATVI will excel in Early 2019,"TLDR at bottom

Getting right to the obvious point here, ATVI is going to see a surplus of sales of their new upcoming Call of Duty game. This is mostly due to the new Battle Royale mode that is being added due to the popularity of other BR games such as Fortnite. Call of Duty sales have never been able to grow their new sales numbers, majority of consumers are loyalists. This is because its a dying franchise in terms of fan base and dwindling new player base. 

There was a DD I saw somewhere, LINK would be appreciated, that basically described what was mentioned above.

But heres the meat and the potatoes, ATVI will have a boost in stock from Q4 sales (i.e holiday shopping, game release date) but lets not forget when the earnings are released in 2019.

Also one last note, ATVI is Activison and Blizzard both companies make games that have a constant revenue system through the notion to unlock cosmestics by purchasing them which in sense equals $$$

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Buy ATVI now and hold until April/May 2019. We getting rich off Call of Duty y'all ",Ghouls-N-Magnets,1538492716,1,64,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9kreac/activision_atvi_will_excel_in_early_2019/

EA is due for a massive market correction when people learn to read reports,"So if you can tell by my name I've been heavily invested in EA for the last month making small calls all the way up making a good amount of money on the way. 

Today a report dropped saying that FIFA 19 physical sales were down 25% in the UK. This lead to EA falling 2.5% immediately.  Whats important to note about this report is these are not the official sales figures they are third party estimates and THEY DONT HAVE DIGITAL SALES. 76% of all game sales of this year are digital. 

The majority of FIFAs revenue comes from digital sales from micro transactions to game sales with an increasing majority of game sales coming purely from online outlets. The idea that physical sales being down when digital sales have historically been reaching new all time highs year over year is fucking retarded. FIFA is  one of if not the most profitable game series on the planet with an extremely low cost to production and as of last year pulling nearly a billion in micro transactions alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason why FIFAs physical sales would be substantially further down this year over previous is that origins new premium membership system gives you free access to all new EA games for the cost of like $100 a year. Plenty of the people who were hard line on buying FIFA anyways would already have the origin premium and would not have gone out to buy the game anyways in person.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR physical sales being down in the UK in no way represents the actual sales and profitability of the game since the vast majority of sales are digital and micro transactions make nearly a billion a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

If your not a pussy buy into EA right now and take the free money

Making Money from Addiction," 

Greetings fellow Autists. This is my first DD submission so I’ll keep in brief. 

TL;DR, 2 drugs related to opioid epidemic up for Adcom mid-Oct and FDA Approval early Nov.  I focus on Trevena ($TRVN) here. You may also be interested in ($ACRX). FYI the DoD is a big fan of $ACRX drug which is a lozenge they can use on battlefield. FDA has said they will take into account DoD objectives when approving drugs.  

Both are up significantly in the past month but have room to rise before Adcom. I believe these are multi-bagger plays but can’t predict their performance on the two major catalysts. Been a lot of selling on good news in biotech lately (or so i’ve been told always).  

Trevena closed at 2.17. It fluxed between 1.57-1.80 a bunch before rising last week and continuing to inch up with minor retracement.

I’m not going to pretend to know how these drugs actually work. I won’t even pretend to understand the market. My model portfolio is a rotating mash up of WSB DD from first time posters.

I do however know a few things about the FDA, CMS (Medicare / Medicaid) and the NIH (I used acronyms here to further demonstrate my expertise). I’ve had things approved by FDA, paid for by CMS and granted money for study by NIH so I’m reasonably attuned to changes and opportunities in these overlapping sectors of gov. 

Specifically I (and you) know that the **Opioid epidemic is a big deal.** Its such a big deal that the House passed a bill this week with special focus on funding to develop non-opioid alternatives to treat pain. The money in the bill isn’t huge but its a big **signal to other agencies like NIH and FDA to get their shit together and fast track the development and approval of drugs.**  

**Trevena ($TRVN) - Drug Name Olivo; Oliceridine (TRV-130).**

**Adcom: Oct. 12**

**FDA Decision: By Nov. 2**

Oliceridine is a “G protein-biased MOR small-molecule agonist that has been shown to exert analgesia with less respiratory depression and constipation than morphine.”  

Why its better than Morphine:

TRV-130 (Oliceridine) was comparable to IV opioids at pain reduction, but lower for vomiting, respiratory events (a big deal, people die because they just stop breathing), upper GI tolerability and constipation.  

**Why I think it will be approved:**

1. **Doctors seem to love this drug.** That is a big deal, to be approved it needs to basically be safe (or slightly safer than something thats not very safe) and have an actual demand from doctors who would utilize it. This seems to be two big thumbs up.
2. **The National Institute on Drug Abuse is studying an oral version of Oliceridine (TRV-734) as a potentially differentiated therapy for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence.** 
   1. **They are so hot on this drug they want to make an oral version to give to addicts instead of methadone.**
   2. PO: 75N95018P00541 Aug 29, 2018 if interested in reading.
3. **The Donald has his small but mighty fist on the scales of the FDA.** By swapping out career FDA folks for his flavor of sycophants he has increased the rate of drug approvals during his administration, making 2017 a record year. 2018 is off to a rocking start again. Now is the golden age of slamming shitty drugs through the FDA. This one isn’t shit so by that logic its a slam dunk.  

I have a big night of being cuckolded ahead of me so I’ll close here. If people are interested I will dig in further on this and on $ACRX.  Bring on the hate. Would also be cool to learn how to play this situation better.  I feel solid on the macro dynamics but not the micro trading strategy.

Digging into Trevena Pharmaceuticals - $TRVN,"First let's talk about our drug that we want to focus on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Taken directly from their website - [www.trevena.com](https://www.trevena.com)

# At Trevena, our mission is to deliver innovative medicines to patients and healthcare providers confronting serious medical conditions.

[Oliceridine injection](http://www.trevena.com/Oliceridine.php), our lead product candidate with FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation, is a next generation IV analgesic in development for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this [link](http://www.trevena.com/trevena-pipeline.php) you can find the company's current pipeline. The drug in question is TRV130 Oliceridine. 

&amp;#x200B;

"" Oliceridine injection was designed to optimize opioid receptor pharmacology using Trevena’s proprietary platform to deliver an improved analgesic profile compared to conventional intravenous (IV) opioids. Oliceridine injection is the first G Protein-Biased Ligand at the μ-opioid receptor, and is in development for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain where IV therapy is preferred. 

&amp;#x200B;

 In February 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to oliceridine injection. This designation is granted by the FDA to new therapies intended to treat serious conditions and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial clinical improvement over available therapies. In January, 2018, we announced that FDA has accepted the oliceridine injection new drug application for review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act review date of November 2, 2018. ""

# Trials

Phase 2 results

[http://www.trevena.com/pdf/Singla\_et\_al.\_J\_Pain\_Research\_2017102413-24.pdf](http://www.trevena.com/pdf/Singla_et_al._J_Pain_Research_2017102413-24.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

It is a lengthy read so here is the summary. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Results: Two hundred patients were treated (n=39, n=39, n=83, and n=39 in the oliceridine regimen A, oliceridine regimen B, morphine, and placebo groups, respectively). Patients were predominantly female (n=198 \[99%\]) and had a mean age of 38.2 years, weight of 71.2 kg, and baseline pain score of 7.7 (on 11-point numeric pain rating scale). Patients receiving the oliceridine regimens had reductions in average pain scores (model-based change in time-weighted average versus placebo over 24 hours) of 2.3 and 2.1 points, respectively (P=0.0001 and P=0.0005 versus placebo); patients receiving morphine had a similar reduction (2.1 points; P&lt;0.0001 versus placebo). A lower prevalence of adverse events (AEs) related to nausea, vomiting, and respiratory function was observed with the oliceridine regimens than with morphine (P&lt;0.05). Other AEs with oliceridine were generally dose-related and similar in nature to those observed with conventional opioids; no serious AEs were reported with oliceridine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: These results suggest that oliceridine may provide effective, rapid analgesia in patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain, with an acceptable safety/tolerability profile and potentially wider therapeutic window than morphine.  

&amp;#x200B;

[http://www.trevena.com/pdf/Viscusi\_et\_al\_PAIN\_2016.pdf](http://www.trevena.com/pdf/Viscusi_et_al_PAIN_2016.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Also another lengthy read. 

&amp;#x200B;

 The analgesic efficacy of TRV130 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain was achieved without SAEs. Although proof of concept was demonstrated for analgesic efficacy, robust tolerability comparisons were limited by dosing methodology and modest sample size, and future studies are needed to continue to assess tolerability. These results also suggest CU for TRV130 at different points on the dose-response curve: Higher doses may provide previously unachieved reductions in pain intensity in clinical scenarios that require greater analgesia, with dose reduction as an option to preserve sufficient analgesia with fewer ORAEs than experienced with conventional opioids.

&amp;#x200B;

 In summary, this study demonstrated TRV130 analgesic efficacy in patients experiencing moderate-to-severe acute pain in a bunionectomy model. In-study comparisons to morphine suggest that G-protein-biased m-opioid receptor activation may enable increased efficacy with acceptable tolerability vs conventional opioids.

Now looking at older posts of $TRVN it seems like it hasn't been performing too hot. There haven't a whole lot of posts regarding this company in the past year. The most recent one was 3 days ago. Mentions of morphine being cheaper than this drug doesn't look like good news. It's going up against something which has been a staple in the medical community for many years.

Now you wonder, how come this will be twice as good? Well because, they have TWO FDA approvals coming up this Thursday!

It's trending down and has been for a while. It's all time low is at $9 and it's currently trading at $9,2 (It's at $9,7 now. Started writing this post Friday morning). The run-up has not yet started so I would say this is a good entry point. We might see this trending up before the decision on Thursday (It has most likely all ready started it's run-up, up 3,19% Friday).

Well well, they are another Pharma stock. Boring i know. I just wanted more text so you guys think this is some high quality DD and buy this shit.  

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on to their TWO drugs which will both receive an approval (hopefully) on the 4th of October aka next Thursday. Omadacycline (ABSSSI) and Omadacycline (CABP) 

&amp;#x200B;

Starting with some information about Omadacycline (ABSSSI): 

&amp;#x200B;

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) have become a challenging medical problem associated with high direct and indirect costs to both the medical system and society.  These types of infections are responsible for more than 750,000 hospitalizations per year, representing a 17.3% increase in hospitalized ABSSSI patients from 2005 to 2011.

ABSSSI includes the following diagnoses:

* Cellulitis/erysipelas: A diffuse skin infection characterized by spreading areas of redness, edema, and/or induration
* Wound infection: An infection characterized by purulent drainage from a wound with surrounding redness, edema, and/or induration
* Major cutaneous abscess: An infection characterized by a collection of pus within the dermis or deeper that is accompanied by redness, edema, and/or induration

These skin and skin structure infections, if left untreated can cause potentially life-threatening infections in bones, joints, surgical wounds, the bloodstream, heart valves and lungs.

[The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)](http://www.idsociety.org/Index.aspx) Guidelines issued in 2010 recommend surgical debridement or drainage of skin and skin structure infections and, where appropriate, initial empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy pending culture results.  Conditions where antibiotic therapy is recommended include:

* Large abscesses surrounded by extensive cellulitis, or accompanied by signs and symptoms of systemic illness
* Abscesses associated with severe or extensive disease (e.g., multiple sites of infection) or rapid progression in presence of associated cellulitis
* Abscesses associated with comorbidities, immunosuppression, septic phlebitis, or extremes of age
* Abscesses in an area difficult to drain (e.g., face, hand, genitalia)
* Lack of response to incision and drainage alone

One of the main challenges in treating ABSSSI is [antibiotic resistance](https://paratekpharma.com/science/antibiotic-resistance/).  In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of severe ABSSSI requiring hospital intervention caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, in particular methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) strains.  Beginning in the mid-1990s, the prevalence of MRSA shifted from healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) to community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains.  CA-MRSA is now the leading identifiable cause of purulent skin and soft tissue infections in emergency department patients in the United States.  Typically, upon hospitalisation, a patient will be treated for an antibiotic resistant ABSSSI with one or more intravenous antibiotic.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also some information about Omadacycline (CABP): 

&amp;#x200B;

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is a lung infection caused by bacteria that develops in people with limited or no contact with medical institutions or settings.

* The most common symptom of pneumonia is a cough that produces sputum, however chest pain, chills, fever, and shortness of breath are also common
* Doctors diagnose community-acquired pneumonia by listening to the lungs with a stethoscope and by reading x-rays of the chest

CABP ranges in severity from mild infections that are successfully treated with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting to severe infections that require hospitalization and treatment with monotherapy or a combination of intravenous antibiotics. In the most severe cases, CABP can result in complications such as respiratory failure and septic shock.

While several bacterial pathogens can cause CABP, *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is the main culprit with about 500,000 cases of pneumonia in the United States each year. Pneumococcal pneumonia is a leading infectious cause of hospitalization and death among US adults.

According to the Center for Disease Control, antibiotic resistant *Streptococcus pneumoniae* in the United States is responsible for:

* 2 million resistant infections per year
* 19,000 excess hospitalizations
* 7,000 deaths per year

The emergence of antibiotic resistant *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is an increasingly common problem in the United States and elsewhere, with more than 40% of all pneumococci falling into this category by current in vitro definitions of resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

*Staphylococcus aureus* is another bacterial pathogen that may cause CABP.  Since the year 2000, the number of cases of pneumonia caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* that are resistant to some types of antibiotics has increased. This bacterium is known as community-acquired methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (CA-MRSA), and it can cause severe pneumonia.

&amp;#x200B;

What can Omadacycline do: “Omadacycline is a modernised tetracycline antibiotic with the potential to help address the urgent and growing need for new agents to treat serious community-acquired infections,”  Evan Tzanis, chief development officer for Paratek, told Infectious Disease News.  “If approved, Omadacycline would be the first once-daily IV and oral antibiotic in more than a decade.”  I smell rocket fuel... lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Source: [https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/antimicrobials/news/online/%7B8c111960-478c-48f4-ba73-e15ab2f35d56%7D/fda-committee-recommends-omadacycline-for-approval](https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/antimicrobials/news/online/%7B8c111960-478c-48f4-ba73-e15ab2f35d56%7D/fda-committee-recommends-omadacycline-for-approval)  

&amp;#x200B;

They are both currently under ""priority review"" and as I mentioned before the decision is on the 4th of October.   Also ""According to Paratek, omadacycline was recommended for approval based on safety and efficacy results from phase 3 clinical trials."" ABSSSI was voted for approval with a result of 17-1. CABP was voted for approval with a result of 14-4. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if these two drugs get approved they will be the first daily Omadacycline drug in the last decade with diseases which actually are harmful. CABP which has 7 000 deaths each year and another 19 000 people which are hospitalised. Then ABSSSI which has 750 000 people hospitalised each year. It feels like these drugs could help a lot of people if approved and with already good results from their Phase 3 trial and not only that, they have both been voted for approval with great results it seems that these will get approved, yet the stock has not shown any big movements. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am no expert but I believe that this will be a good play for next week. This is some DD i have gathered. I will add more if I find some thing interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

If both manage to get approved this thing will rocket. I also feel that both will get approved or neither. Which makes it easy, we either go to 0 or the moon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also they have another FDA approval coming up the 19th for Sarecycline. More info on that yet to come. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: I do not own positions for PRTK yet.

[DD on Elon Musk mental health here],"&gt;**Alert alert**: This post contain nerd information, if you dislike that, skip to the tl;dr section at the end of the post.

First of all, this is going to address a few personal points (given my personal post history, feel free to check it, I have proved over 56 different substances for research and non-functional purposes), but ALL information will be given their respective scientific (or almost scientific) citations. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, [Elon Musk said he was using a medication known as Ambien, or Valium](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-using-ambien-push-130900205.html), which its main component is [Diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam). Diazepam is a [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) drug, which is one of the nastier, if not the most nasty class of drugs in recent history. Yes, more than Opiates. Although Opiate drugs are fatal because of their overdoses, they're not toxic (they do not permanently damage your brain in any way), nor their withdrawal symptoms will kill you. Diazepam and benzos in the other hand, are a time ticking bomb. [If you don't believe me, try looking at the polls scores for poly-users most difficult experiences when dealing with every kind of drug.](http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/395340-What-is-the-worst-drug-to-have-withdrawals-from) And also, [There have been scientific proof that benzo users are those who endanger their health the most, not in the long-term, but in the short-medium term (Canadian Research results)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869089/).

  
Most drug classes have rehab centers, because they can be treated in a matter of days, but according to the most accepted medical resource in the area benzo discontinuation, [The Ashton Manual](https://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/), benzo tapering can take months, and a big percentage of users don't seem to recover completely even after years. Higher base anxiety, epilepsy, heart problems, they're all related to benzo use.

Well, then you can ask, ""That only happens to those who abuse them, right"", not quite. The maximum time someone should be prescribed benzos is 3 months, but the average time patients spend on these medications extend for years, due to lack of knowledge of the psychiatrists of the medication problems (Most of them were way out of college when most of the research about it has been published), so it's safe to say we have millions and millions of american currently dependent on that shit, big time. Elon Musk is one of them.

Why is it so bad, you ask, well...

[Bartards](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bartard), as we call them, are worse than dealing with your uncle that smoke meths and fucks truck exaustor thinking they are a cow's pussy. It's main usage characteristics include:  


* Acting like a fucking lunatic, they say things he didn't of the consequences
* Amnesia
* Disinhibition
* Hypnotic properties

Sounds familiar doesn't it.

But for some god forsaken reason, you're still able to retain your basic and even advanced cognition functions. That means it's like being drunk, without even NOTICING that you are drunk. In fact, one of the most commonly reported symptoms is [**Delusions of sobriety**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)**,** which is almost like a psychotic symptom, people think they're acting cool and nothing has changed, but they are so fucking out of their minds they don't even notice. There are memes at r/drugs about most people that abuse Xanax ending up in jail, dead or raped by their uncle (or having sex with animals wtf), and that guy, the CEO of that company, is addicted to this shit. [It also has strong evidence with some kind of correlation to demencia](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/900813), in a way that's not entirely understood right now. So,

Sleepy BIO play with upcoming FDA approval for orphan drug and other catalysts coming soon - TLGT,"This is from their [last Conf. Call:](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-tlgt-earnings-conference-060554589.html?.tsrc=rss) 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;As you know, our strategy has been predicated on the idea that R&amp;D productivity will drive revenue and growth. Over the course of the first half of this year, our R&amp;D team has continued to deliver above and beyond the competition. **So far in 2018, Teligent has scored 9 ANDA approvals,** of which 4 were received in the second quarter. As a result of these approvals, **Teligent has 6 drugs pending launch**, and we are actively working to bring drugs to market as quickly as possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now looking at the trailing 12 months based on FDA approval data, Teligent has risen to #10 globally in ANDA approvals from FDA. I think that's why I'm so excited about the progress that we're making on our transition to injectable development in manufacturing.  
&gt;  
&gt;We've already received temporary certificates of occupancy for the site that allow us to use the facility for the manufacture of our injectable exhibit batches. We've made the batches for our first 2 injectable drugs now that will be used to support a pre-approval inspection by FDA. We anticipate receiving a final certificate of occupancy for the entire site this quarter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before I turn over to Damian, who'll also discuss guidance, let's talk a little bit about what I think this business looks like on a go-forward basis. **First, for the remainder of 2018, we now have 8 FDA ANDA submissions with GDUFA goal dates by year-end,** with a total addressable market of $366 million based on recent IQVIA data. **Given our current track record, we feel confident that we will continue to bat above average when it comes to converting these submissions into approvals and launch drugs.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, one of **the most exciting parts of that pipeline for us is the GDUFA goal date for our first orphan generic drug, which has a goal date in September this year and is currently under active review by FDA**. We're already preparing for the launch of this product together with our partners in order to bring this alternative to patients as soon as possible post approval.

BlackBerry Earnings - A New Hope,"BlackBerry. You haven’t seen their phones around in 12 years so they must be a shit company, right?

Maybe. I don’t know.

But what I DO know is that they stopped manufacturing handsets after getting their dicks stomped by Apple and Android in a market BB basically created.

Since the cock stomping, they have pivoted towards one of the juiciest market segments out there right now: the Software Services industry (SaaS). They are riding the ~Internet of Things~ buzzword (creating their coined Enterprise of Things), and hired a real gunslinger in 2013 to switch things up. The CEO is on the board of Disney and Wells Fargo.

With said gunslinger, they have sold and implemented their proprietary EoT software to:
-100% of Fortune 100 commercial banking firms
-100% of Fortune 100 aero/def firms
-100% of Fortune 100 media/entertainment firms
-88% of Fortune 100 medical firms
-77% of Fortune 100 insurance firms
-motherfuckin NVDA

This was all cemented on the Q1 CC, and the stock dropped from $11-&gt;sub $10... 

I think BB is due for an inevitable return on the SaaS front, the question is... does it start tomorrow?

Only hold ups would be that BB sued FB a while back for taking BBMessenger’s IP for WhatsApp and FBM. FB has now countersued, which doesn’t look good.

——-TLDR STARTS HERE——

With BB having their teeth deeply sunk into the enterprise software market with a growing market share v. IBM/MSFT, I believe we will see them become fruitful this quarter or at least be end of FY19. 

Even if the financials aren’t good this Q, we should see some extremely positive guidance unless the FB bullshit is causing them to hemorrhage cash.

I will be instancing vertical debit spreads on BB (long $10, Short $11, exp 11/2) at 3:45pm. Definitely want to fix risk/eliminate Theta&amp;IV here with the off-chance that this has somehow been an earnings run-up.

Thoughts? I’d love an inverse opinion here bc my DD has me noticeably overconfident. ",dscg24,1538070166,1,0,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9jezmj/blackberry_earnings_a_new_hope/

HRTX Buying Opportunity,"Heron Therapeutics is dropping today because of an article that came out [today](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/opioid-legislation-could-lift-certain-hospital-operators-drugmakers-2018-09-26) specifically naming HRTX as being hurt by the new opioid bill, likely in response to its pipeline drug HTX-011.  
What the article gets wrong though, is that the new opioid bill specifically has a section 3001 [summary] (https://energycommerce.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/HR6_09.26.18-Final-Opioid-Sec-by-Sec_BIPART-BICAM.pdf) [actual legislation](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180924/HR6.pdf) which specifically says that the secretary of HHS has to have a meeting within a year of the bill passing to talk about non-opioid painkillers.  
The interesting thing is that during [Heron's phase 3 clinical trials](https://herontherapeutics.gcs-web.com/static-files/09cfb8c6-499d-439d-a728-d236ea9e91df) the company specifically tested for its effectiveness in reducing opioid consumption and use. In fact the clinical trial was so successful that it was granted [breakthrough therapy designation](https://herontherapeutics.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/htx-011-postoperative-pain-management-receives-breakthrough) by the FDA.  
Today is a great buying opportunity since the company has a great track record of delivering (past drugs of SUSTOL and CINVANTI), and is about to file the NDA for HTX-011 anyday. Huge upside, though this is likely a buying equity play rather than calls due to the longer timeline of getting the FDA approval next year.",a_lost_function,1537986445,11,9,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9j54x4/hrtx_buying_opportunity/
$PFE $ARTS $PRTK,"PFE: Treats form of non-small lung cancer (Drug: DACOMITINIB), Expected: **EOM**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult to treat, particularly in the metastatic setting. Biomarker therapies dramatically changed the care of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Approximately 75 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with metastatic or advanced disease where the five-year survival rate is only five percent.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“What is most encouraging about these results is that patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR-activating mutations who received dacomitinib achieved a median overall survival of nearly three years, a marked improvement compared to an established treatment in this setting,” said Mace Rothenberg, MD, chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “With today’s podium presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Priority Review granted earlier this year, we are encouraged by these data and committed to deliver this promising investigational medicine to patients as quickly as possible.”   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In April 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted priority review for dacomitinib for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations. The FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is in September 2018. The European Medicines Agency also accepted the Marketing Authorization Application for dacomitinib for the same indication. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

ARTS: Testosterone Deficiency (Drug: XYOSTED), Expected:  **September 29, 2018**. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Antares received a complete response letter for Xyosted that did not cite any questions relating to efficacy, manufacturing, quality control or the device used to deliver testosterone. Surprisingly, the FDA raised concerns that Xyosted could cause a clinically meaningful increase in blood pressure and might also be linked to depression and suicidality.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**The FDA Unexpectedly Responded to the NDA Resubmission with Lightning Speed; this is Highly Positive**  
&gt;  
&gt;In December 2017, Antares prepared for and requested a type A meeting with the FDA to discuss the CRL: this took place on February 21; 2018. The Company described the meeting as cordial. Antares announced on March 27, that it had received the official minutes on the type A meeting with the FDA. The Company said that based upon this that it believed that it would not need to conduct any new clinical studies to resubmit the NDA for Xyosted. At the time, Antares said that it expected to refile the NDA in 2Q, 2018. FDA guidelines mandate that the FDA respond within 30 days to determine whether the filing constitutes a complete response that addresses all deficiencies in the CRL.  
&gt;  
&gt;On April 5, 2018 Antares announced that the FDA acknowledged receipt of the resubmission to the Complete Response Letter (CRL) which Antares had submitted on March 29, 2018, earlier than the earlier guidance of a second quarter resubmission. Moving with unaccustomed speed, the FDA said that it considered this resubmission a complete, class 2 response and assigned a PDUFA date of September 29, 2018. The FDA had 30 days to consider the resubmission and my experience is that if the FDA has 30 or whatever days to respond, it invariably uses the full amount of time. It is out of character to respond in just eight days. This acceptance also takes away the risk and uncertainty that a new trial would be required.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Key Conclusions**  
&gt;  
&gt;This quick action by Antares in resubmitting the NDA just two days after receiving minutes of the type A meeting and the FDA accepting the filing as complete just eight days later is very positive.

LENNAR,"Thesis: LEN will beat earnings on October 3rd.  Estimates are from 1.19-1.29, my guess is 1.81.

Caveat: Even if my expectation of a beat is correct, it could still be annihilated as was its peer KBH, which reported . 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The below was written prior to the release of the August New Home Sales figuers here:  [https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html)

&amp;#x200B;

These were better than I expected, but June and July figures were revised down, so that cancelled out whatever the upside may have been.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

DD: 

&amp;#x200B;

First, I noted that the New Home Sales figures for the first two months of the third fiscal quarter were significantly higher than in 2017, per [census data](https://www.census.gov/econ/currentdata/dbsearch?program=RESSALES&amp;startYear=2016&amp;endYear=2018&amp;categories=ASOLD&amp;dataType=TOTAL&amp;geoLevel=US&amp;adjusted=1&amp;submit=GET+DATA&amp;releaseScheduleId=).

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I looked at the regional sales growth (click the Tables \[Excel\] [here](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html)) and determined the weakness in the North East (-48.8% declines year-on-year) would not impact Lennar, since Lennar does not operate in those States (see the 10-Q for Lennar's definition of sales regions; none of these overlap with the census definition of the North-East).

&amp;#x200B;

I then confirmed that homebuilder sentiment was still high, lumber prices (everyone was rattled in Q2 about Canadian tariffs) had normalized, and starts had resumed here: [https://www.nahb.org/](https://www.nahb.org/)

&amp;#x200B;

I then went to Redfin's data center to see if things were as terrible as the Redfin CEO seemed to say: [https://www.redfin.com/blog/data-center](https://www.redfin.com/blog/data-center) \- they did not seem to be as catastrophic as he implied, and his words only refer to used housing anyway

&amp;#x200B;

I then read the Barclay's Homebuilder's Report (released 13 September 2018) and noted the various headwinds from mortgage rates and affordability, but saw they were still overweight on LEN with a $63 price target (the lowest analyst target is $56: [https://www.benzinga.com/stock/len/ratings](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/len/ratings))

&amp;#x200B;

I then re-read the Q2 earnings transcript (I had listened to the Q2 call live; analysts were very congratulatory) and affirmed that it had been as positive as I remembered.

&amp;#x200B;

I then noted that LEN's multi-family segment must be part of CNBC's commentary on housing starts in August ([https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/us-housing-starts-aug-2018.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/us-housing-starts-aug-2018.html))

&amp;#x200B;

\[See Lennar's multi-family segment; it's pretty cool: [https://www.lennar.com/nextgen](https://www.lennar.com/nextgen)\]

&amp;#x200B;

I then bought approximately 30k worth of October, November, January, and February calls when the stock was between 51 and 52.69. Strikes were 50, with some 52.50s in October.

&amp;#x200B;

It then collapsed to it's 52 week low while my fiancee was visiting me and I couldn't even drink whisky in my menagerie to dull the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

KBH, Lennar's peer, beat earnings: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kb-home-fiscal-3q-earnings-201928257.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kb-home-fiscal-3q-earnings-201928257.html) yesterday, but nonetheless 

&amp;#x200B;

I await my fate on October 3rd.

"My take on $PLUG power, near and long term tendies, DD inside","**TLDR**: Buy $PLUG $3 11/16 calls for tendies as Plug Power will see the results of opening new factory, developing robots to take advantage of autonomous forklifts and delivery trucks, and developing new tech to double power storage. $AMZN, $NKE, and $WMT already use their equipment (and will purchase more) and $FDX has conducted 7500mi of deliveries in the Albany area using a Plug Power powered FedEx truck.

&amp;#x200B;

**DD**:

WSB listen up - Plug power is going to pop soon with a price target of $3.57, a 90% increase over its current price for the near term tendies. It will increase over the next quarter further as it completes its transition from research company to viable manufacturing company. I have 155 $3 11/16 calls for the near term tendies based around its 11/8 earning report, which I'll then turn over to 3/15 calls for the long term tendies where I expect it will jump yet further.

Walmart, Amazon, Nike, and FedEx have opened contracts with Plug Power for hydrogen powered forklifts and vehicles. Hydrogen power might seem lame but their niche is in industrial forklifts and local deliveries where time spent recharging is thousands of dollars a minute. Their CEO Andy Marsh has also been named to the U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee, giving the business the political connections it needs to succeed. Jonathan Silver, a member of the board of directors, is also a former US Department of Energy official. They are also pursuing European expansion to become an international company, where the political connections will offer them an advantage over their competitor Bloom Energy.

All eight of the board members have purchased hundreds of thousands of shares in the company four times since the beginning of the year, most recently in late August, signalling that they see a positive future for the company as it has turned around from a research company to a viable industrial and manufacturing business. Institutional investors have increased their stakes by millions of shares - Odey Asset Management Group Ltd bough an additional 2,330,000 shares increasing their stake in the company to 4,910,000 shares. Ignore the misleading title of the article and read content for a breakdown of the institutional investor increases: ([https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html](https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html))

This is also different than a vehicle running on LPG or other alternative fuel. The hydrogen isn't burned in the traditional sense, but is instead run through a membrane that strips the electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst and generates electricity directly from the reaction - the hydrogen then bonds with available oxygen and generates water as a byproduct. The advantage of this type of system is the reduced refueling/recharging time compared to traditional electric forklifts that are used in warehouses, and the reduced emissions compared to traditionally powered forklifts. Their systems are retrofit-capable and can be fitted to currently owned electric forklifts, reducing the overhead of purchasing all-new equipment.

They have also in-sourced the production of the membrane electrode assemblies to further reduce costs ([https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article](https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article)) and opened a new almost 40k SQFT factory in Rochester New York ([https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park](https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park)). They used to purchase their membranes for their equipment from their competitor Bloom Energy, and now that they are producing their own membranes they have announced two new pieces of technology - a new membrane that doubles the energy output of its fuel cell system.

Herschel Segal – Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer

**Herschel Segal**

Good afternoon and thank you, Howard. Thank you all for joining us. Our slate of board members were elected at the annual meeting in mid-June, halfway through the second quarter. Since that time, we have begun collaborative work to reverse the tide of recent negative quarterly results.

We know that DAVIDsTEA is a leading tea company with great products and a recognized brand. We also know that we are in a healthy industry and I believe on the right side of history. Tea remains the second most consumed beverage in the world after water. A February 2018 Euromonitor International report states that the trend over the past decade of consumers increasingly drinking tea continues. This is because Canadians are becoming more aware of the health benefits and the huge variety of tea offerings.

Euromonitor also observed two distinct tea markets in Canada in 2017. There is the traditional market, where products are presented mostly in teabags, that are sold primarily through supermarkets, hypermarkets and discounters. And you have on the another category of players distribute tea in bag or sachet format but currently focus on loose-leaf and organic teas.

As we look for our growth opportunities, we know we must capture more of the teabag market. This can only happen with better pricing and a continued mission to bring consumers a convenient tea experience that they cannot obtain in traditional markets and at the same time, offering consumers the opportunity to purchase our teabags in the traditional supermarket environment.

Two positive actions that have been taken with respect to capturing more of the teabag market: first, we are now working to buy teabags smarter and for less so that we can price our products better for our customers and attract many new ones; second, last month, we launched an excellent program with Loblaw Companies and are now in 450 stores across Canada, including Loblaws, Independent, Zehrs, Valu-Mart, Atlantic Superstore, Dominion, Provigo and Fortinos. These banners now offer a variety of our best-selling, 15-pack tea sachet flavors. This product is merchandised at eye level and the consumer response to date has been very good. This is a great way to further promote our brand.

Overall, we are a merchant operator, first and foremost, and we must deliver the right product at the right price. Therefore, our focus needs to be on improving our purchasing and delivering the brand wherever the consumer wants the brand wherever the consumer wants it. This includes in our stores, bricks and mortar, or online, through other retail channels as well as other potential growth areas such as hospitality and travel markets.

Following a thorough evaluation, we determined that we need to get back to the basics of product innovation and procurement. To make this happen, we have made adjustments at head office to change our operations and our culture. We are building a strong team and we have put more senior leaders in buying, marketing and product development. We are also paying more attention to our costs. As well, we are ready to find a CEO who will enthusiastically adapt to the DAVIDsTEA environment, lead with a realistic optimism and bring vision that will be refined and further developed with the senior executive team and the company's board.

A great deal has been accomplished since mid-June. We are working hard to continually seek improvements, and I feel confident that we are putting in place the steps needed for the future success of DAVIDsTEA.

With that, I will turn the call over to Howard.

**Howard Tafler**

Thank you, Herschel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my remarks with the review of our fiscal 2018 second quarter results. As a reminder, the dollar amounts referred to in reviewing our results are in Canadian dollars. Sales decreased by 12% to $40.2 million in the second quarter of 2018 from $45.7 million for the same period in 2017.

We ended the quarter with a total of 239 stores, an increase of three net new stores versus 233 stores at the end of Q2 2017. Second quarter comparable sales decreased by 14.8% as our product offering did not resonate with our customers. We were less promotional as we moved to reduce our dependency on discounting, and we had less products available for our semiannual sale as we were in a better seasonal inventory position compared to the prior year quarter.

In addition, we have revised our merchandising strategy, which has not reflected in our second quarter assortment. This is compared to a 0.9% comp decrease in Q2 last year.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 43.2% from 44.2% year-over-year as product margin increases driven by less promotional activity and a shift in product sales mix were offset by a deleveraging of fixed costs due to the negative comparable sales.

Adjusted SG&amp;A in the second quarter decreased to $24.6 million from $25.9 in Q3 2017, due to lower stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expenses. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&amp;A increased to 61.2% from 56.7% last year due to deleveraging of fixed costs due to the negative comparable sales.

Adjusted results from operating activities for Q2 2018 recorded as a loss of $7.3 million relative to a loss of $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2017. In Q2 2018, the company recorded an adjusted net loss of $5 million or $0.19 per fully diluted share. This is compared to an adjusted net loss of $4.2 million or $0.16 per fully diluted share a year ago.

Adjusted EBITDA was negative $5.9 million in the second quarter compared to a negative adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million in Q2 2017. At the end of the second quarter, our ending inventory was $33.7 million as compared to $28.6 million at the end of Q2 2017. In terms of liquidity, we ended the second quarter with $39.6 million in cash. We are continuing to clearly manage our cash position and balance sheet.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Herschel for some final remarks.

**Herschel Segal**

Thank you, Howard. As previously announced, Howard will be leaving by the end of the month as he has accepted a position in another industry. We sincerely thank Howard for his valued contribution to DAVIDsTEA over the years and wish him every success in his new position. Joe Bongiorno, our Director of Finance, is taking over as Interim CFO while we conduct a search for a permanent replacement.

Further, the board recently named two independent directors recommended by our Governance Committee, Anne Darche and Susan Burkman. Anne is a well-known marketing and consumer trend specialist with a 20-year career in Montreal advertising agencies. She serves on the boards of a number of other companies. Susan Burkman has 35 years in the investment banking industry and has successfully led equity, M&amp;A and valuation and fairness opinion transactions in Canada. We are very pleased to have them both on board.

We have now entered a new era at DAVIDsTEA. Our dynamic management team is focused on what needs to be done as we begin the road back to profitability. I am confident that our shareholders will see improved results within the next nine months, and we will continue to share our progress with you as we move forward. Thank you for joining us today.

I'm Still Bullish on Micron:,"**Q4 2018:**

Revenue: $8.44bn (up 38% YoY)

Net Income: $4.33bn

Cash Flow: $5.16bn (up 61.25% YoY)

&amp;#x200B;

**Fiscal Year 2018:**

Revenue: $30.39bn (up 50% YoY)

Net Income: $14.14bn

Cash Flow: $17.40bn (up 113% YoY)

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights of the call:**

· The record revenue was due to SATA SSD (but Micron may be switching away from this into MDME SSD.)

· DRAM increased to 70% of revenue 

o The ASP of DRAM products remained unchanged Q/Q, but higher demand lead to more revenue

· NAND ASP declined by 12%. However, sales increased by 30% YoY

· Micron is going to be hiring over 1000 new employees by 2022 as they believe expansion is key and the demand for memory will support the expansion

· Cash position declined sequentially, but that’s due to a reduction of convertible debt notes. $6.4bn worth of debt has been paid off.

· Hired new President of worldwide sales- Mike Bokan

&amp;#x200B;

**The Future of Micron:**

Unfortunately, Micron’s guidance for Q1FY19 was much weaker than what I was expecting. Let’s look at what they predicted:

*Non-GAAP Guidance:*

Revenue: $7.9bn - $8.3bn

GM: 57% - 60%

Operating Expense: $750mm +/- $25mm

EPS (based on 1.2bn sharecount): $2.95 +/- $0.07

There are a couple of factors affecting guidance that I believe are actually blown out of proportion. First and foremost, Micron’s tax rate is expected to increase from 2% to 12.8%. This is drastic increase that was expected due to the next tax bill. On a proportional basis, I believe the tax rate alone will decrease EPS by about $0.34.

In addition to this, tariffs and CPU shortages became a big point of contention. It is hard to estimate an exact impact of tariffs, but I estimate this will reduce EPS by about $0.12 (even more if tariffs become 25% rather than 10%). Intel has three facilities making 14nm chips, and though Intel already spent $1bn on CAPEX, adding even more production takes time. This slow-down in production is a short-term loss for Micron as PC makers aren’t buying as many memory chips because of slowed production due to scarce CPU chips. Unfortunately, the weakened demand on Intel causing shortages is expected to last about 2 quarters.

&amp;#x200B;

**Supply/Demand Outlook:**

Micron expects DRAM to up about 22% YoY and NAND to be up as much as 45% YoY for the remainder of 2018. For 2019, Micron expects DRAM bits to grow another 20% YoY and for NAND to slow the growth to only 40% YoY.

Micron believes that DRAM profit GM will remain strong, if not increase, while NAND supply to moderate itself due to 96L challenges (Sanjay touched on this during the call. Approx. 37:00). Micron will also actively work to produce 3D X-Point.

SEMI’s World Fab Forecast data point to an improbable eye-watering fourth consecutive year of fab equipment spending growth to the tune of 5 percent.

[https://imgur.com/a/VsallVb](https://imgur.com/a/VsallVb)

When putting FAB spending on the same axis as aggregate revenue, we see that this carries an r2 value of 0.772, which is very strong.

[https://imgur.com/a/U9gFEeM](https://imgur.com/a/U9gFEeM)

So this shows us that an increase in FAB spending should lead to an increase in revenues, which should drive the stock prices higher even if the multiples aren’t changing.

On this note, Intel is expected to spend $5bn in Israel this year ([Intel Expansion](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12774/intel-discloses-plans-to-spend-5-billion-on-israeli-fab-28)).

Micron Technology is opening a new facility in Singapore this year ([Singapore Facility](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12622/micron-starts-construction-of-third-nand-fab)). Micron is also opening a new facility in Singapore. Overall FAB spending in expected to see a 5% CAGR spending starting this year.

Inkwood Research sees the semiconductor market growing at 7.67% CAGR through 2024, ending with an $835bn market by then. In 2017, the semi market was $499bn with $364bn in sales. Discounting these numbers at the same rate (73%), this gives us $607bn.

Obviously the market is discounting that growth by a fair bit, with concerns of cyclicality and a drop off in prices. The semiconductor cycle is boom and then bust. We've clearly had some boom, but have we had it all?

Going into 2018, a KPMG survey found the semi cycle to be mostly expansionary still.

Concerns of seasonality/cyclicality have started to really grow. After a huge runup in SOXX (semiconductor ETF) over the past few years, it's up 5% this year so far with long peaks and troughs, running up strong when the market is running good (December/January) and getting hit hard in overall pullbacks (February).

**Memory Outlook (As per BoAML):**

As I stated above, the entire semiconductor industry hasn’t reached its peak, and I don’t believe it will for at least 10 years. Recently, Merrill Lynch analyst Simon Woo visited South Korea (one of the biggest countries for memory) and had many positive things to say about the industry:

· CAPEX remains conservative for wafer fabrication equipment and incremental spending is mostly absorbed by shell fab construction.

· DRAM market is seeing low inventory levels for a few weeks. NAND inventories are behind by 4 weeks

· ASP in 2019 should remain stable

· NAND ASP in the rest of CY18 should be smaller than expected

· Tariffs will have a minimal impact

· DRAM demand is solid (30-40% bit growth)

**The Negatives:**

· Their guidance is weaker than I would’ve liked regardless of the reason.

· Even if Intel CPU shortage is true and affecting Micron, this means poorer demand

· If Micron is building inventory now, this probably will lead to oversupply in CY2019. This would likely drive prices lower.

· Higher CAPEX weighs in on operating cash flow. In turn, this forces depreciation expenses to increase, which drives EPS lower.

· NAND prices are falling 

· The already-below EPS estimate is with a 1.2bn sharecount, which is not taking into account the buyback. With $1.5bn in buybacks this quarter (assuming a share price of $45), we still have 1.166bn shares outstanding. Adjusted for GAAP diluted EPS, we are still NOT up to analyst estimates.

**The Positives:**

· Management states that weak guidance is due to CPU shortages on behalf on Intel, tariffs, and higher taxes instead of being due to weak demand.

· DRAM supply/demand outlook appears to be very healthy. Micron says that accelerating supply growth worries are overstated and that DRAM bit growth should be 20%.

· Though NAND prices are falling, this accounted for only 13% of revenue and sales increased by 30%.

· Network Business Unit is very strong. Revenues nearly doubled YoY. Nvidia chose Micron as a partner for GDDR6 graphics alongside Nvidia’s new TRX GPU

· Mobile Business Unit revenues rose 60% and are expected to rise further going forward.

· Micron is spending $10.5bn +/- 5% for CAPEX in 2019. Would a company who is expecting a decline in demand want to expand their business? No.

· Though ASP may decline, production costs are declining as well and should offset the price. 

· Micron is going to actively buyback their stock up to $10bn. Dave Zinser stated that Micron will actively spend “at least $1.5bn on programmatic stock repurchases this quarter and could direct additional funds towards opportunistic repurchases.”

· Micron is also using their FCF to pay down debt. This is never a bad sign",itschrisolson,1537543753,94,57,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9hr14i/im_still_bullish_on_micron/

Delusional MU Bull Thread,"Like everyone here, I am definitely pissed about the CFO's Q1 guidance after a stellar quarter. But I can't help but agree with Papa Sanjay and how he routinely mentioned throughout the call ""that we continue to believe our stock is undervalued."" He also discussed the declining cyclicality of the industry. Hynix and Samsung are slowing their production. With respect to NAND, Micron has the highest cost-efficiency in the industry. They still expect 20% DRAM and 40% NAND growth annualized over the next five years. While I was done dirty and will never trade MU calls again, I don't see how this isn't a great long-term play. I get this is WSB and it's short-term, but it's not like the fundamentals absolutely collapsed. Oligopoly. I'm still with Tepper and still with Papa Sanjay. Jesus didn't deliver over-night.

Notes on Micron’s Conference Call:,"Sanjay Mehrorta (CEO) just said “our stock is undervalued and we will be deploying metrics to expedite the buyback and increase shareholder value.”

CC is looking great so far!

• Record SSD revenue due to SATA SSD

• Storage lead to 13% of total revenue

• DRAM is 70% of total revenue
    • ASP (average sale price) is unchanged sequentially but higher shipments lead to higher revenue in segment. (This is the same thing CFO said 3 weeks ago)!

• NAND ASP did actually decline by about 12% even though sales increased by 30%

• CFO is optimistic about the future and Micron is going to be hiring 1000 new employees in order to expand the business. (Great sign in my opinion)

• Focus of 2019 will be on expanding DRAM market, leaning more toward the first-half of FY2019

• Cash position declined in Q4, but used that cash to reduce debt by $6.4bn!

• Hired new President of Sales- Mike Bokan. He will start October 1.

GUIDANCE:

• We are seeing impact of CPU shortage

• Gross margin to be affected by Tariffs. Working to mitigate impact, but only so much they can do

• 2019 tax rate is expected to be 12.8% 

• Non-GAAP guidance:
    • Revenue: $7.9bn - $8.3bn
    • Margins: 57% - 60%
    • OPEX: $750mm +/- $25mm
    • EPS: $2.95 +/- 0.07

• Will spend $1.5bn in 1st Q to buyback shares

• Will also buyback more shares when they seem undervalued in addition to $1.5bn

• Will not be disclosing predicted margins going forward as they believe “it’s proprietary and not important.” This is a major negative in my opinion.

SUMMARY:

Great quarter for Micron. They did guide down for next quarter and FY2019, but I believe it is because 2019 will be a transition year away from SSDs.

Micron is STILL a buy in my opinion, but I am less confident in Micron after hearing this new call. We WILL need memory going forward, and Micron is one of the leaders in the field.

Full disclosure: I will most likely start taking profits sometime soon &amp; reduce my position and diversify into other companies. Not a bad quarter, but guidance is lower than I’d like. Pricing, unfortunately, is not one of the things you can forecast easily. Demand drivers are still vibrant.

Q/A:

“What % of the lowered margins are from tariffs vs declining memory trends?”

CFO believes it will take about 2 quarters for it to recover and that tariffs account for 100-150 basis points.

That’s reassuring to hear, actually.

Kind in mind, margins in Q1 2018 were 55.1%. While they expect margins lower than this quarter, 56% margins are still higher than last year.",itschrisolson,1537479429,115,84,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9hj91y/notes_on_microns_conference_call/

NVDA benchmarks results are better than expected!,"The performance of the new turing cards are out and reviewers are recommending that most gamers pick up the older generation of cards.

This outcome is so much better for shareholders than most people probably realize! There are a lot of comments across several platforms where people are claiming to have cancelled their preorders for the 2080ti and are picking up a 1080ti instead; however, if you check out tracking websites, such as nowinstock.net, the 2080ti is still sold out. Additionally, the 2080 is sold out at many vendors, but not all.

The people that don't care about blowing a lot of money on new tech (myself included) for less than linear performance gains will buy the new cards in great enough numbers. While the normies that don't want to spend that much for the top of the line will deplete the supply of the old generation of cards. Then after the old cards are gone, the turing cards will come down in price and capitalize on the people that were holding out for the price drop.

Additionally, the new architecture seems poised to be much more powerful for the professional market (with the non-gaming cards) with the addition of AI focused cores. It seems similar to AMDs development of Ryzen-TR-EPYC as a ""glued together"" scalable architecture. Not exactly the same, but primarily developed for higher end, higher margin markets (data center) while able to provide value to regular consumers.

The stock price has not caught on yet, and may continue to fall over the next month, but this is good for NVDA. I'm calling 300-315 by Janurary.",iaminan,1537448325,10,29,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9hf2qb/nvda_benchmarks_results_are_better_than_expected/

Public Service Announcement to MU callers,"Here is why I think MU kills earnings tomorrow. Lets start with the basics and review last quarters Q3 report. It what went down as Micron's record breaking quarter, MU stock was nothing short of spectacular in future guidance and results. 

**Finacials**

Revenue

MU reports Q4 with expected revenues of 8 to 8.4 billion. For this to be met we would have to see a 2.5% increase. In Q3 MU saw revenue grow 6% sequentially (Q2 to Q3), with its current momentum I don't foresee how this portion can be miss as stated by Micron President and CEO ""We see ongoing momentum and healthy industry fundamentals in the 4th quarter to close out an exceptionally strong 2018"". I predict revenue to be 8.3b+ 

**Mobile Business**

In what came to leaders as suprise the mobile business of the company saw a 12% increase in revenue. This increase will most likely see further increases as the high-value NAND see's more tuning and focus leading to higher margins, better reliability, and supply. 2 new breakthrough launches including 1Y nanometer low power DDR4 memory and several 64-Layer TLC UFS are sure to provide even more momentum. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Data Center Trends &amp; SSD's**

Worldwide the demand for valuable and high value solutions in the cloud and datacenter has increased. Revenue up 37% from last year and not cooling down. Production shipments of new 96 layer 3-D NAND and development of 4th generation 3D NAND serve to increase these numbers 

&amp;#x200B;

**Intel Partnership** 

On track to develop and introduce 3D XPoint late this year. Company achieving record gross margins even with underlying charges associates with advancing the volume ramp of 3D Xpoints solutions. 

&amp;#x200B;

""We are on the strongest financial footing in the company's 40 year history"" - Dave Zinsner, Senior Vice President &amp; CFO

&amp;#x200B;

**Units**

Nearly all business units with the exception of Storage Business unit which is gaining momentum due to new SSD portfolio and 3D XPoint Sales. Transition to selling 64-layer SSD's will benefit the bottom line as the focus shifts away from 32 layer 3D NAND (Currently targeting cloud and consumer customers) 

&amp;#x200B;

As evident in the last quarter company leadership has done an exceptional job moving focus to profitable products and correctly creating plans to expand into the 3D market with its partnership with Intel. For the future it plans to start to buy back diluted stocks beginning in 2019.  Exponential revenue growth in almost all units, I don't see anything cooling down. I predict an EPS of 3.36+

$NKE Earnings Report 9/25 - DD and thoughts?,"Whattup,

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts on the Nike upcoming earnings report. First off, call is on 9/25 after close, I'm getting 9/28 calls tomorrow.

Nike is up about 10% since last quarter (May: $71 - Aug: $78). Kaepernick ad increased sales by like 30% I believe and now this report just came out: [https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/nikes-number-of-sold-out-products-spiked-after-kaepernick-ad-report](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/nikes-number-of-sold-out-products-spiked-after-kaepernick-ad-report)

 \- Alot of sold-out Nike products basically

We won't see those this ER but the news will probably drive it up even more.

Nike has beat their last 4 ER's and the stock has popped on the last one big May's ER: Stock jumped $8 after ER!

This quarter runs from May - Aug. Here's where I think it may beat even more. 

This year was the World Cup- largest sporting event in the world. Even bigger than that, Nike sponsored 10 teams (Adidas sponsored 12) and out of those 10 teams, 3/4 were in the top 4 teams and France (Nike) won this WC. Perhaps there was more revenue as Nike sponsored national teams grew closer to the finals and after France won! In addition, Nike sponsored Nigeria and saw a record breaking jersey preorder of 3 million Nigerian official jerseys. Nike also sponsored more individual player's boots with 60% of the top 200 players being sponsored (including Neymar, Ronaldo and Kane). Finally, Nike has outperformed Adidas stock in 4/5 past world cups, I expect them to do the same this year.

Nike's EPS (0.62) is lower than the past few ER's by a few cents, even given the WC additional revenue. It has beaten 6/6 of the past ER's and I expect it will do the same this time.

\&gt; What's everyones thoughts? I'm gonna grab a few $85 calls and $88 - 9/28 at open tomorrow, especially with todays dip I think this will be good. Hoping to see another $6-10 jump after earnings.

Goodluck everyone!

Tesla Going Bankrupt? Long DD Post Inside.,"[https://imgur.com/a/9uFgMxS](https://imgur.com/a/9uFgMxS)

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't a new topic because much has been said for the past couple years about Tesla's financial situation. Since just about the beginning of Elon Musk's involvement with the company, Bears have been claiming that the E.V. Companies' days are numbered. In my opinion the threat of Filing Chapter 11, or even Chapter 7, have never been more imminent.

 So why, after all this time, is the downfall of this company just around the bend? The timing seems suspicious, especially with the new release of their supposed Cash-Machine the Model 3 this year. Well.... things aren't always as peachy as the outward appearances make them seem.

&amp;#x200B;

Well lets talk some random facts and educated estimations

1)Around Labor Day, Tesla is estimated to have around  1.2 Billion in cash reserves

2)Tesla currently burns about 300 Million dollars a month.

3) In November a Convertible Debt payment of $230 Million is due

4) In March a Convertible Debt payment of $920 Million is due

5) Per contract, the full amount of their March Convertible Debt (920 Mill) PLUS a 400 Million dollar  cushion MUST be in their CASH account by DECEMBER 31st.

6) Tesla has about 3.5 BILLION in Accounts Payable, which means they currently OWE Parts Manufacturers, Bills, ETC in that amount

7)In the time since they became public, they have only had one profitable quarter (couple YEARS ago)

8)From 2010-2018 They have raised 19 Billion and are NEGATIVE 9 Billion in cashflow

Judging by the current financial situation alone, you can see how the current picture being painted is UGLY AF. 

&amp;#x200B;

So whats the obvious solution for them?

The only thing that will get them out of this Money Jam is to either Take on more Debt or issue new stocks through an Equity raise.

So why haven't they done that already?

Well, for one, Tesla's Bonds have plummeted, meaning the banks/companies who issued them have priced in the very HIGH probability that Tesla will default on the bond payments. Do you think these companies will be in a rush to issue even more debt? (Didn't even mention that the upcoming Debt payment schedule only scratches the surface of the totality of Debt/Bonds Tesla has accrued in the past decade or so)

So how bout an Equity raise? 

Elon pretty much screwed the pooch on this one singlehandedly. Earlier in the year, on a conference call he did already say that their was no need to raise Equity and that Tesla would be fine without it. Lets get that out of the way. The real, high probability reason why Tesla isn't raising money right now is because they are UNDER INVESTIGATION. First it was the SEC, now the DOJ is involved in possible criminal charges being raised against Musk. He really messed things up when he claimed back in August in that ill-fated tweet that he was considering taking the Company private @ $420. And that Funding Was Secured. It turns out that Funding is in Fact NOT SECURED and that sending out tweets like that can be construed as Stock Manipulation. How the investigation turns out, remains to be seen.

If you think very little will come out of that investigation, that's on you. Just know that Subpoenas are being sent to companies and people are being questioned regarding situations going far beyond just sending out a idiotic Tweet. The implications here are possible Book Cooking and making Fraudulent statements to the public regarding financial details.

Where does that leave us?

Tesla has a shit load of debt, due in a very short amount of time with little to no ways to raise money to pay for it. THAT is the perfect recipe for Default aka BANKRUPTCY. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a couple other things of note that add to this thesis:

1)Over the past couple months, parts manufacturers and companies servicing TESLA have filed several LIENS against them. This implies that either Teslas Cash situation is worse then we thought and they've already ran out leaving them unable to pay the people that enable them to CREATE the purpose or their companies existence, CARS! Or they are hoarding what little cash they have left to show some kind of numbers on the next quarters books and/or pay off upcoming debt obligations. REMEMBER, 3.5 BILLION in Accounts Payable. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Just over the past month their CAO (Chief Accounting Officer) Dave Morton resigned from the company after working with them for about less then a MONTH. He left his previous job as an executive/officer for 23 years. He was going to be paid $325,000 plus $10 Million in stock options. What did he see in those financials that was so terrible, or what illegal activities did he not want to be a part of that he left 10 Million on the table and left a job after a MONTH?!? Tesla is supposedly going to turn it all around this quarter, why leave on the cusp of greatness? Once he got a glimpse of those books, he must've realized hes on the Titanic and that bitch is about to hit a iceberg of debt and career killing scandals. I should also point out that over the course of the past year, about 13 high level Executives have left the C-Suite of Tesla. Must be a great place to work at. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) My final little blurb on all this mess has to do with current perception. At this very moment it looks like Tesla has taken a turn for the better. Their stock is rising (aside from the drop yesterday) Model 3s are being delivered (through logistics hell) and Elon is promising a profitable quarter (from last conference call.) Perception can lose you a lot of money if your not careful. If you start digging a little deeper, you start to see the flaws and how they effect the big picture. Tesla's factories barely, BARELY have the ability to produce the 5000 cars/week that ELON promised. Because of Elons insistence on pushing the factories to meet these numbers, they are pushing out vehicles with defects at an alarming rate. One report stated that on one of the first weeks that production was pushed over 4000 cars in a week, a stunning 83% needed REWORK! Thats money being burned because Tesla cant do what the company exists to do at a decent enough performance. Then there's the dozens of cars being refused delivery because of defects that make it all the way to the customer's hands. Then there's the reports of Tesla having random lots with up to hundreds of cars sitting there, dying. Like literally, batteries dying. Are they inventory that were refused, or signs of something EVEN worse? Like a lack of demand now that they've pushed thru a huge batch of reservations that were waiting on cars. Either way, it all adds up to more and more Expenses. Expenses that Tesla literally cannot afford right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

All these points come together to give a snapshot of a company in turmoil. A company that is dangerously close to insolvency. Elon is touted as a Messiah, but ultimately is one foot off the ledge and the other foot is on a puddle of oil. I'm sure there's more points that can be made, but at this point this post is way too damn long.  

&amp;#x200B;

IMO, Tesla faces BK by March at the latest. The way things seem to be heating up with talk of SEC/DOJ Investigations the timeline could be pushed even closer. November possibly. The quarter ends at the end of this month. Tesla is furiously fighting to show a profit this quarter so they can attempt to raise more money. But i think the jig is up. Times ticking away and i think their too late for any solutions. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to take advantage of a potential move to a stock price of ZERO, options are paying 100-1. Puts will do just fine. I have several spread out up til March at strike prices of 25,40,45, and $50. Take advantage of them while their cheap!

&amp;#x200B;

ATVI Serious DD - Is the street underestimating Blackout?,"Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

Last time I did a DD on Snap I didn't make it serious enough so I guess people didn't listen. Here with the next play though. Please read through the whole thing and give me your thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Blackout. Activision is close to an all time high because of excitement about Blackout. The beta was good, reviews are great. People are hyped. The opportunity stems from the fact that the sales estimates for the New COD are WAY too conservative. I expect Activision's sales to blow expectations out of the water and lead $100 stock price within a couple months. I'll describe my thinking below. 

&amp;#x200B;

Morgan Stanley's latest report has their BULL CASE at around 23 mm units sold. They claim if that happens they expect a $100 stock price. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last two shitty COD games sold about 12 mm. Lets call those guys the Loyalists. They all plan to buy this next game so that's an automatic 12mm. 

&amp;#x200B;

PUBG which is the closest comparison to Blackout has sold 50 mm (same price). Everyone who has played the beta so far has said that Blackout is way superior to PUBG. It's someone took PUBG and had an actual well funded studio produce it. Given that the games appeal to the same demographic and Blackout is just better, I don't think it's a stretch to say that at least 50% of people who bought PUBG will buy Blackout. That gives us another 25mm copies sold. BUT, lets be super conservative and say that all of the COD loyalists also had PUBG, so we'll subtract 12 from 25 and get an additional 13 mm units sold. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far this leaves us with 25mm units sold. That is already surpassing Morgan Stanley's even bullish expectations. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OF THE SALES. We have to account for the Fortnite effect. Fortnite is a very kid friendly game and they have about 80-100 mm non-mobile players. For many of these players, Fortnite might be the very first shooter they've played. In other words Fortnite has expanded the shooter market. On top of that all of the top streamers: Ninja, Lupo, Courage etc have been streaming the blackout beta. Ninja even had 250K+ for one of his streams for blackout. The point is that players (some quite young) who play fortnite and have never bought PUBG or COD may be enticed to try blackout because it's hyped, streamers are playing it etc. In fact Ninja is even headlining a Blackout tourney at Twitch con. So lets say out of the 40 mm or so of fortnite players who didn't play pubg (some may be Old COD fans like myself but havent bought a cod in years), 10 mm will look to buy Blackout. 

&amp;#x200B;

That leaves us with \~35mm units sold, which is almost 50% better than THE MORGAN STANLEY BULL CASE. So point is that there is definitely some upside. that 35mm by the way isn't crazy for a call of duty game. The first black ops sold 32mm and that was half a decade ago, so the market has certainly expanded since then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway the conclusion from this is that you should just throw your money on MU Weeklies and AMD puts, but if you have some leftover, consider buying some ATVI",Harry_is_gay,1537301781,49,41,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9gycou/atvi_serious_dd_is_the_street_underestimating/

$SIX Flags buy-in opportunity,"Anyone looking to get into $SIX Flags, now is your chance. They currently sit at $68.41, with a $3-4 dip since the high last week. 

Every year $SIX announces their upcoming park improvements between Aug 30-Sept. 1. From that point on there is a 25-30% run up until early 2019! (Based on the 5yr history chart of Six Flags). This year $SIX announcement included several record breaking rides as well as the acquisition of 5 new parks (announced earlier this year). 

The run up from this years announcement was quick, gaining about 6% in 2 weeks, however with the pull back it’s now only up 2% since the announcement. 

Despite this hiccup in the growth (also seen in 2016) $Six Flags still has about $13-16 growth to do in the next few months with an expected goal of between $80-85 (based on 5yr history).

While history may not repeat itself, $SIX has a lot going for it this year with the record breaking rides and 5 park expansion. If anyone was looking to get in, now would be a good time. 

Stock price @ $68.41. Calls seem to be a good bet at this price! Dec. $70 @ 2.75 | March 2019 $70 call is $3.90. 

TL;DR: $SIX dip over the last week has brought it back to consistent price point and a good buying opportunity before a $13-16 growth over the next few months. ",TheBoyDilly,1537025585,119,45,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9g2cdv/six_flags_buyin_opportunity/

"Turkcell: Get Paid to Fight Digital Imperialism, Play all EM Telecom with one stonk","Kaan Terzioglu is a badass and you want to invest in his company.

Turkcell is soaring today because the Turkish interest rate hike but also because of the statements yesterday from the CEO that they are working with Huawei to expand the Turkcell franchise empire which already is in Ukraine, Belarus, Cyprus to ALL emerging markets.

Turkcell will help emerging markets either develop their own app suites to compete with western ones or will let them use Turkcell apps with their own skins.

And a ranking executive of Turkcell just took a major job in Erdogan’s communications department. They are also a key investor in Erdogan’s Turkish car initiative.

MU not coming back anytime soon,"Guys look at [this chart](https://imgur.com/bgLyCOg)

- Even if by some miracle major buyers show up, there are many levels of resistance where profit taking will stop any big sudden move up, and this is only chart for September, the longer term chart looks even worse with more levels of resistance.

- There is no signal of the downtrend reversing yet. It’s just down/sideways/repeat so far. 

- The spectrum of outcomes after earnings doesn’t seem great. I have no idea what earnings will be, but look at the range of what can happen. Best case earnings are great but we only see a small bump up, I mean how many of you wouldn’t sell if you could get out at even? Everyone is in that same boat. Worst case earnings are not great and the slaughter continues. The risk/reward here is not great.

- There are probably profits with MU long term but there is a lot of profit taking to get out of the system before we get there.

- Buyback doesn’t seem like it will save the day. They have incentive to buy back at the lowest price they can, and it may be months out before they even begin.

- Too many wildcards possible. September not a great month for stocks historically, possible market crash/correction is pending, tariffs, and even if everything else breaks perfect we are one tweet away from derailing the whole thing.

Buy QCOM Leaps 2020 (DD inside).,"[My last DD on AVGO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9blptm/buy_avgo_calls_jan_or_anything_further_out/) went well, but I was also dumb enough to dump most of [my RH play money into MU Jan 50c's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9eyty7/mu_literal_hindu_prayer_thread/) so take whatever I am saying with a metric ton of salt.

QCOM is basically a tech monopoly, but our politicians are too dumb to understand how email works let alone wireless technologies. 

QCOM is very unique in that they are the worlds most successful patent licensing firm and a semi con. QCOM has two distinct Business units that account for most of their revenues. QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) which sells most of the chips (think snapdragon etc.) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) which is the BU that rakes in all the licensing dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

QCOM has been sued by everyone and their mom (Apple being the biggest one) for predatory pricing and monopolistic practices with regards to the royalty payments made to QTL. **Any resolution in these lawsuit is in fact a net positive for Qualcomm, particularly the Apple lawsuit .** The reason I say this is that Qualcomm and Apple share a codependent love hate relationship and the lawsuit has basically become a [negotiation for future pricing.](https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/01/qualcomm-apple-resolution-offer/)

&amp;#x200B;

QTL is a money printing juggernaut, **it doesnt matter whether or not you use QCOM chips on your wireless device**, you still have to pay the license fees. 

&amp;#x200B;

QCOMs Snapdragon is the best Android processor out there (Apple makes their own.). QCOMs RF and WiFi chipsets are amongst the best in the industry. (Apple used Intel modems and there is a rumor that they might make their own in 2020.)

&amp;#x200B;

QCOM is using this industry leadership to branch of and dominate niche markets like wearables and quick charge. Their IoT and automotive strategy took a bit of a hit with the failed acquisition of NXP, but they havent given up on those markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the wireless landscape there are a bunch of new technologies that will be hitting the market next year and Qualcomm is an outright market leader in many of these.

&amp;#x200B;

**WiFi -** 802.11 ax, only real competition is Broadcom (MRVL, Mediatek and Intel are stinking turds.)and they havent been able to figure out [key parts of the spec](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-battle-for-next-gen-wi-fi-pits-qualcomm-against-broadcom-2018-09-10). This tech is slated to start hitting enterprise end of this year and consumer markets by mid to late 2019 (phones).

&amp;#x200B;

**5G:-** Rolling out soon, testbeds are being scaled up, mass adoption is projected in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  Keep looking at QCOM leaps, end of Apple lawsuit is fundamentally good for QCOM, Trade War is the biggest storm cloud (sorry for using this). Watch for an immediate tank in the stock price from any trade or lawsuit news.  

Again this isnt a FD play strictly long term. 

I dont really know how to do TA voodoo but I think anything below 65 is a steal for QCOM. I would buy leaps if it hit between 65 - 68.

Basically just costs a lot of money to recreate all the operating and hedging stuff under a new company. The company is new but the business is old and undervalued by any and every metric. It's not a sure thing they turn it around this quarter and long-term growth is doubtful but the assets they hold are currently worth 25% more than the current stock price so there is limited downside risk.

DD on trade war : US tariffs are backfiring for now,"**The bilateral trade surplus with the US continued to balloon in August** – standing at a record USD 31 billion, up from USD 28 billion in July 

&amp;#x200B;

**The record trade surplus will just provide more fodder for the Trump Administration** to ramp up tariffs further. Not that they need more of an excuse.  
 

**But there is a plenty of irony here,** because it is the way these tariffs are being rolled out that is actually driving the current massive surplus.  
 

**Recall that the next USD 200 billion worth of tariffs can be applied any day now** – and Trump just reiterated his threat to add another USD 267 billion more on Friday.  
 

**The result:** Trump’s actions are driving the dollar  stronger and incentivizing American buyers to bring import purchases  forward in time – to beat the next round of tariffs.  
 

The timing element will all change, of course, once the full complement  of tariffs are in place; but as long as there is the threat of more to  come, the incentive will be for Americans to purchase MORE Chinese  goods.  
 

**Get smart:** The negative effects of the trade war still  aren’t showing up in the data, but they will soon. Purchases that were  brought forward into Q3 will be purchases forgone in Q4 – expect very  weak Chinese export data to close out the year.

**Geron**  $GERN – Short term buy

As opposed to the more common AML and CML, myoproliferative neoplasms don’t have substantial clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The aforementioned AML and CML have very common chromosomal translocations – one of the reliable ones was the BCR-ABL fusion – which lead to the so called Philadelphia chromosome – and the huge success of Gleevec. Myoproliferative neoplasms don’t seem to have those huge rearrangements. Recent sequencing studies have pointed towards FLT3, JAK2, MPL, and RAS mutations being associated – but so far they haven’t proven to be great targets. RAS has never been a good target, despite being one of, if not the first oncogene discovered. Imeltestat targets Telomerase. I’m not going too in depth about telomeres, however consistent proliferation of these cells (aka cancer), will lead to the telomeres eventually disappearing. So the cancer’s have to “learn” how to turn Telomerase back on if they want to keep proliferating. Imeltestat prevents telomerase from doing its deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

The downside to Geron are that they are a 1 trick pony. All their eggs so to speak are in the Imeltestat basket along with their partnership with JnJ (albeit 100 mill in bank). I don’t think targeting telomerase will “cure” these neoplasms or contribute to PFS in any meaningful way. However, it could lead to really good extension of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imeltestat is on JnJ’s current list of compassionate use drugs – which is a good sign. Anyways, JnJ will have to give their decision soon – which will be a 65 million dollar payment, and then structured rewards of up to 800 based on the clinical trials. On the down side, Imeltestat has been associated with a shit ton of adverse events. 

&amp;#x200B;

If JnJ decides to not pick up the partnership, expect the stock to crater. The IV is huge for the options, so you’re looking at a huge move in order to make any money. However, this is prime WSB Yolo material. Its going to be at either +50% or -80% within 2 weeks. I’m buying stonk, and puts at $5 for some semblance of downside protection.

**Omeros $OMER** – Strong buy short term and long. 

I find tons to like in this company. They really have a ton in the pipeline with a bunch of different diseases, which is really unusual. They have several shots on goal for their most developed lead, OMS721 (aka trials in several different disease spaces). They should have some data coming soon on the IgA Nephropathy – which is a very common kidney disease. OMS721 targets a portion of the innate immune system as opposed to the adaptive immune system (the one you hear most commonly about).   This is a Phase III trial, so you would expect a big pop if it looks good.  

&amp;#x200B;

I’m really a big fan of their pipeline. PDE7 and PDE10 are both really interesting targets. Dart Neuro - prior to their folding - was really a PDE10 company, and there is a lot of literature that backs up PDE10 being a potential treatment for Alzheimers. Also given that PDE10 inhibition doesn't work on anything specifically with Alzheimers, I'm guessing we'll get a ton of off label boomers using it.  PDE7 I think is a little more exciting. It is mainly present in both Immune cells and Neurons, and its activation can cause neuroinflammation. There is some good evidence that PDE7 inhibition can help with both Alcoholism and Opiod addiction, a space that has significant unmet needs. They are targeting movement disorders as well (AKA parkinsons), which I find a little quizzical, but will read more into. Given that the company has survived for quite some time, and still has a fairly healthy balance sheet, I think it’s a great short term and long term buy. There is while significant short term downside risk if OMS721 fails, I don’t think their totally nuked like some of the other biotechs are. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other really impressive thing is beyond their mix of diseases and targets, is that they’ve proven themselves to be competent in both the antibody space (OMS721), and the small molecule space (PDE7, PDE10, pparg) - plus their approved therapy (Omidria) Also they can run clinical trials. Also they’re developing platforms. Seriously, WTF? Its rare to see even larger companies this aggressive with different spaces. This all speaks volumes about leadership competency. They apparently are hiring a ton, because there are a bunch of job listings (75 ish) on linkedin  - which means the management has to be pretty bullish. On the flipside, glassdoor isn’t too kind to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm buying  NOV16 26C, OCT19 30C, and Stonk.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not certain we'll hear the OMS721 data prior to Oct19, hence my going a little further OTM for the lottery ticket play.  ",orchid_breeder,1536529396,73,45,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9egsrj/some_september_biotech_dd/

MU DD Let it ride ...,"I have been reading WSB for a long time now and this is the worst advise ever. People need to BUY good companies and hold them for long time.  Buy low and sell high I don't even know how to stress this enough. Everywhere I read everyone has given up on poor Micron and I keep hearing about top of the cycle. Micron is the 15th most profitable company in the world right now. Let that sink in !! They are trading at a 3.89 PE which shows that in 3.89 years they can make up their entire market cap in pure cash.  They make a billion dollars a month in cash so everyday they are making 33+ million.

The competition is SK and Samsung who have already stopped expanding. The competition and MU will not let the last over production happen this cycle. In addition they are in the most up and coming industry of data centers, AI, autonomous driving, and IOT. Last cycle there were 7 memory manufacturers and now there is only 3.  It's impossible to just start up a memory chip plant as it takes years.

Even if this is the peak of the cycle they still have lowered their costs to manufacture DRAM, Forget NAND for a moment and just focus on memory. All these devices that we use everyday needs memory. Soon every car on the road are going to require SO much memory.  Data Centers are where it really is right now, however every one of these sectors is young and just now starting.

Today was the washout or capitulation of the longs. People finally had enough of these constant down days and threw in the towel. This is the time to buy ! They traded 96.5 million shares today where they average only about 36 million. On every message board people are dumping this stock and talking trash just like this post.

People need to give MU time and it will shine. The problem is everyone needs instant satisfaction so when it dips hard they cry like a little bitch. Today is the day you should back up the truck

Lastly the reason MU is the red headed step child is due to the unbelievable amount of CALLS that have been purchased over the last 5 months. From April this year to Jan 20 it was almost 900K calls which is INSANE. Does anyone really think the big funds are going to let those people walk away with that much money. Look at all the CALLS strikes going to 2020 and fortunately a lot have expired already and even more once we get out of September. After Sept 21 the over hang of so many CALLS really goes away. If you want to sell go ahead, but I have lost money on 10X worse stocks than this.",ridenourt,1536275638,49,47,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9doa9o/mu_dd_let_it_ride/

ADATA is a Taiwanese DRAM manufacturer. They reported 35% increase in monthly DRAM sales from July to August. Looks good for MU ER this month. I assume people are more interested in guidance for the next quarter however to confirm the cyclical theory.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the biggest things overhanging MU is the cyclical theory, that memory prices will collapse any time now and these companies will stop producing record profits. SK Hynix announced a delay to the expansion of their new facility a few weeks ago which triggered the initial 5% rally. However a rumour going to press in 6 hours on [Digitimes](https://www.digitimes.com/topic/bits+chips/memory_chips/) is that ""Samsung, SK Hynix reportedly to defer expansion plans"". No doubt this would reduce the supply that the cyclical meme relies on.

Gamestop: Buy calls before earnings,"&amp;#x200B;

You may ask yourself why would anyone invest into a company that makes it's money selling video games in a era where physical games are a dying breed. With the advent of downloadable content and streaming services, alongside heavy competition such as Amazon, and Best Buy who would think to buy calls. Here is my take  

**Current Price: Gamestop $13.89 (+4.71%) .** 

I will be buying long term calls specifically Jan 18, 2019 $14 Calls which are currently going for $1.42   

**Why Buy**

Although the business is dying investors and the market are well aware of this. Leaders have set the bar so low that a beat has become expected. Looking over the last 4 earnings calls 3 have been beats. The scheduled Q3 call (Thursday after hours) has an expected EPS of .08, the lowest in history as far as I could trace back. Video game sales are up lately fueled by the Nintendo switch and various other new releases ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/201093/revenue-of-the-us-video-game-industry/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/201093/revenue-of-the-us-video-game-industry/)) . This situation points me to think that Gamestop is primed for a beat even without considering other factors. Other incoming news suggest that the company is close to be being acquired by Sycamore Partners and by some estimates the price of such an action would nearly double the stock price ([https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202784-gamestop-critical-valuation-role-sycamore-partners](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202784-gamestop-critical-valuation-role-sycamore-partners)). With nearly a 48% short pool this make it a prime candidate for a short squeeze . The company may be in decline but it is a profitable business and with the right partners and strategy it could be transformed into a growing enterprise.

Biotech write up: $AVMXY DD inside,"Posting what I wrote in another sub:

Lads, I've benefited quite a bit from multiple subs and wanted to give my two cents about a stock I see immense potential in(will put this elsewhere as well)

AVMXY is Avita medical. It's an Australian company listed as an OTC. Their claim to fame is a product called RECELL. 

What RECELL basically does is use a RES system which is regenerative epithelial suspension for burn victims. It is an autologous suspension that contains cells necessary to regenerate epidermis and provides a way to above closure if burn wounds. We all know burns aren't going away anytime soon and be seen in anyone from combat victims to fire victims or car accidents. Their product mainly comes into play for third degree burns and sometimes in second degree burns where skin grafting may be needed(taking skin from one part of the body and placing it on another). They did a multi centered randomized  controlled trial which was published which showed that patients who got their product RECELL essentially :
- required 97% less skin graft than those who did not
- had possible faster wound healing
- had less pain during recovery (burns are obv painful)

This is huge and potentially transformative for the burns industry. It is not currently approved but it's PMA application is currently being reviewed by the FDA and a decision is likely in Q3. The company is very confident that this will be approved and has already started production. Earlier in the year the FDA approved an increase in the number of patients who could be treated with RECELL under its compassionate use of investigational decide exemption program(basically allowing experimental therapy in extreme cases). They thus used it on 108 patients.this and its study results almost guarantees approval of the product which will be huge.

Imagine every burn center carrying Recell if it is approved. That's big.

I see one of a few possibilities:
-it gets listed on NASDAQ
- it gets bought out by another company
- nothing happens and it loses steam

I think the third is very unlikely given how this product can change management of burns. The first two possibilities are likely. It is currently $1.47/share which is still cheap. I can't predict how high it'll go but I do see an upward trajectory.

Constraints:
It is an OTC stock and these entail more risk than other stocks since they aren't as ""vetted."" That being said, they have already started in Europe and china so that's a good sign.
Also, interestingly it's been very quiet. Other than a couple of people mentioning it before, I haven't really seen it ""take off"" on Reddit. I believe mainly coz it's an OTC.

I see big things for AVMXY and I just bought quite a bit over the last week. FYI I am not trying to shamelessly promote this. I'm trying to give my two cents as DD and if you guys like please research the stock, company and the medical evidence. DONT  buy just coz I said so. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

"$25K, how would you play it?","Is anyone sticking around the sub for Labor Day weekend? Because there are so many better things to do but this place is my crack and I can't stay away so here's a full blown post that I labored over putting together for the lack of something better to do - if you're here like me, throw me some pity feed lol.

So after mulling for a month, I finally pulled the trigger today and sold off a couple hundred shares of SQ (screw fomo) to open up 25K of buying power because:

1. I'm waiting for a September dip for everything but especially SQ (SQ's looking pretty parabolic),
2. I want to switch out shares for call options on SQ, and
3. I need BP ready to make some retarded bets playing on Q3 earnings

[proof](https://i.redd.it/8ugg51z2gkj11.png)

Personal plan, I'm planning to buy shares and call options on SQ the first dip I see. 7K in SQ options to commemorate how I started with 7K in SQ shares last year when I first started active trading (gay, I know lol) and I'm thinking of putting 10K back in SQ shares. With the rest, I'm planning to buy FDs in advance of earnings run-ups in October. Btw, I'm new to options. To test the waters, I ran an experimental options portfolio for a month on RH with 1K that [did better than I expected](https://imgur.com/CKspWwZ) (positions: winners were SQ calls (earnings), ETSY calls (earnings), AAPL calls, CRM calls; losers were FNKO calls (earnings), FB calls, DOCU calls). But that was just this August just working its magic. I'd be happy just to have a 50% gain in September. In total, I'll be playing with 12K for various non-SQ FDs.

**Got any FD suggestions for the 12K? Or would you play my 25K any differently?**

On a side note, if the SQ dip never comes in September (trollollol) - do you think I should just get back into SQ at an inflated price before Q3 earnings season or just hold onto my cash lol

Buy AVGO calls. ( Jan or anything further out),"Alright boys, we all made a ton of money on AMD and NVDA. Now let me speak to you about another big daddy in the semi con space. 

With a PE of 8.16, dividend of 7.00, market cap of 90 billion and revenues of 17.64 billion, AVGO is a money printing machine. 

Analysts are projecting a 17 per cent growth in revenues for the next quarter on a year on year basis. 

Their CEO is one of the best the semi con space has seen, the man has consistently grown shareholder value, year on year. 

AVGO and QCOM basically have a monopoly on the wireless chipset market with a stable of IP that makes it’s near impossible for anyone else to enter the space. 
 
And unlike certain other semi con companies most of their products cannot be called easily replaceable commodities with storm clouds over their head. 

The market has unreasonably shat on the stock because Daddy Hock wants to step out of the semi con field and get into enterprise software. His 19 billion dollar (cash) acquisition of CA technologies was followed by a in warranted 15 per cent drop in the stock price. 

Ever since then the stock has languished around the 210 level, with a low of 205 and a high of 220. 

Daddy Hocks’ specialty is buying profitable bloated companies with large IP portfolios and widening the margins buy firing people, selling parts of said companies and/or cross selling with existing products. He has done this numerous times with his previous acquisitions such as Broadcom, LSI, brocade etc. 

CA technologies is all of this, just not in the Semi con space. 

I believe that this acquisition is just AVGOs first foray into a new space because they cannot make anymore meaningful acquisitions in the semi con space without regulators accusing them of monopolistic practices. ( QCOM merger was thwarted because of this) 

The company is highly undervalued right now with earnings coming on the 6th of Sept. 

Daddy Hock has done no major press events since the acquisition and this earnings call is going to crucial to address those concerns. 

I am buying / have been buying Jan 250 and 240 calls. Am also looking to buy further dated calls after exiting my MU and AMD positions.

$MU to invest in city named Manassas... truly a WSB move," 

*— Micron        Technology plans total expansion of approximately $3 billion        and 1,100 new jobs in the City        of Manassas —* 

MANASSAS, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Governor Ralph        Northam today announced that Micron        Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), one of the world’s largest        semiconductor companies, will invest $3 billion to        increase memory production at its operation in the City        of Manassas, creating 1,100 new jobs by 2030 in a community        that has become a regional hub for technology and advanced manufacturing        industries.     

The City of Manassas        and the Commonwealth of Virginia        faced fierce competition against other U.S. states and countries like        the Republic of Singapore        to secure what the Virginia Economic Development Partnership        estimates to be the largest private-sector capital investment in modern Virginia        history. The expansion is also significant in that it marks the largest        project win in terms of increased exports for the Commonwealth and        strengthens Micron’s position as Virginia’s largest exporter. The City        of Manassas plans to work closely with major education        institutions like Northern Virginia Community College and George        Mason University to ensure Micron has a continuous pipeline of        qualified, technically-skilled labor.     

On the heels of the recent news that Aurora Flight Sciences will invest $13.75        million in the City        of Manassas, Micron’s expansion further cements the City as        one of Virginia’s most highly sought after locations for technology        companies. Manassas        boasts:     

&amp;#x200B;

* **Tenth highest weekly wages** and the **16th highest per capita          income** in Virginia;       
* **Fourth highest wages in professional and technical jobs** in the          Commonwealth**;** and       
* More than **20,000 people commuting into this City of 43,000** each          day to work at jobs in financial services, health care, homeland          security and defense contracting.       

“Micron's expansion in the City        of Manassas represents one of the largest manufacturing        investments in the history of Virginia        and will position the Commonwealth as a leader in unmanned systems and        Internet of Things,” said Governor Northam. “This $3        billion investment will have a tremendous impact on our economy        by creating 1,100 high-demand jobs, and solidifies Micron as one of the        Commonwealth's largest exporters. We thank Micron for choosing to deepen        their roots in Virginia        and look forward to partnering in their next chapter of major growth.”     

“For almost two decades Micron and Manassas        have been partners in the manufacturing of semiconductors and community        development, as the City was with IBM before them. The        significant benefits that the company brings Manassas        by virtue of their employment and investment help us make advances in        public education, infrastructure development and in maintaining a stable        tax rate for all of our citizens. On behalf of our entire community I am        thrilled Micron has chosen to modernize and expand operations here which        will guarantee the relationship continues into the future,” said Mayor Harry        J. Parrish II. 

“Micron’s Manassas        site manufactures our long-lifecycle products that are built using our        mature process technologies, and primarily sold into the automotive,        networking and industrial markets,” said Micron President and CEO Sanjay        Mehrotra. “These products support a diverse set of applications        such as industrial automation, drones, the IoT (Internet of Things)        and in-vehicle experience applications for automotive. This business        delivers strong profitability and stable, growing free cash flow. Micron        is grateful for the extensive engagement of state and local officials        since early this year to help bring our Manassas        expansion to fruition. We are excited to increase our commitment to the        community through the creation of new highly skilled jobs, expanded        facilities and education initiatives.”

CRON new deal with AGI,"Most of you are already familiar with $CRON from the weed stock hype recently, but a big issue people had with $CRON's growth was that it nearly matched $CGC's growth, but with no new innovations to support it. Today they went into a joint venture agreement with an affiliate of AGI, Columbia's leading agricultural provider.

The join venture established NatuEra which will ship cannabis products worldwide and sell locally. They plan to use 207 acres of available land in Columbia to grow cannabis(1 acre of cannabis is worth \~1.1M). This along with Canada's upcoming legalization of weed leads me to believe that $CRON will go up in the short to mid term.

Now that there is news to support the growth of $CRON many investors may see this as the opportunity to jump on a train similar to $CGC. This stock is extremely volatile so a mid term call that would expire sometime near the October 13th legalization date for Canada would be a better bet than trying to ride a small rise in the short term.

$TLRY DD,It is mind boggling that TLRY with $30M revenue is valued at $5B. Their current production area is around 60K sqft. They will by end of Q1 2019 have close to 1M square feet. They plan to increase it further to 3.8M sqft. Thats why its valued like crazy as in 3 quarters they will pump \~17 times more cannabis.

Nothing lasts forever. Bearish | Earnings | $CRM,"[Salesforce.com](https://Salesforce.com) is one of those infinity P/E companies (on a serious basis), 60x+ if you go by how they cook mgmt comp out of diluted shares. 10x price to sales,Everyone has a buy rating on the thing. 

The problems: The biz fucking sucks. you gotta have an army of consultants (glorified salesmen) remunerated for biz they bring in. The issue is that the salesman take their cut at time 0 even if sub revenue is only coming in years + U not sure these folks are gonna stay. they invest half income into customer acquisition even though they are already a +10B revenue Co. you'd expect 

2. Peer review: there's only one we can seriously use and that's SAP

they have around same market cap, very close gross profit margins, but CRM's pretax margin is close to 1/5th's of SAP's WHILE SAP's REVENUES ARE \~\~3x of CRM

what about growth ? CRM/SAP PEG = 6+/3.5x don't be fooled by the raw figures, growth is cool but it's got a price tag like everything else

SAP Is german, could that be it? no actually being a german large cap tech firm SAP is about one of very few European hot stocks.

Indeed, SAP &amp; CRM are normally highly correlated but lately (see below), the relationship between CRM/SAP is bordering on 2stdev based on 200 days data

3. Stock performance

YTD this stuff is up 50% on a great 1Q growth beat which puts a hiiiigh barrier in front of them. it can go on but if it doesn't, people are gonna take their profits and crash the thing sensibly

# 4. My recommendation:

Option market  is pricing in a 1std move (meaning 68% chance this thing stays in the 144 to 158 range ASSUMING log normal distribution of returns, that's a big IF)

The whole point of my little exposé is that i believe there is a better distribution here:

The thing either falls a lot or goes up a little hence i recommend you buy the 141 put and sell the 155 call  

or if you need closed risk trades u can do 2 bearish put spreads like i did, it's a 5.5x'er

why 141/155? option OI makes this combo plausible for what we're aiming for here, see below.

[DD] $AMZN to $2000 post-earnings?,"Minimum effort DD on my lunch break, but something I’ve been thinking about. 

Amazon is trading at ~$1920 today, and averaging a pretty nice $10-$15 gain per week over the past three months. Assuming this trend continues, plus an earnings beat on Sept. 25th, is it feasible the stock hits $2000 post-earnings?

The math seems to suggest this.
• $15 x 4 weeks = +$60
• $20+ jump from earnings beat (common for AMZN)
• ((15 x 4) + 20) + 1920 = $2000

With all this said, am I crazy? Is there a play here within the next month that could be profitable? Let’s fuckin hear it boys.",ShortAmazon,1535395851,1,1,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9arnrh/dd_amzn_to_2000_postearnings/

**Disclaimer= Everything I write on here is my personal opinion, and shouldn’t be taken as 100% true. Make sure to do your own DD and not to blindly follow others, no matter how “good” of traders they are. All traders are wrong, so don’t be surprised if something on my watch list doesn’t happen exactly how I wrote it down. The important thing is to make a plan, stick to it, and if something changes, adjust it accordingly. Making a plan helps curb your emotions when investing, and keeps you objective.

Notes from Micron talk from a Senior Fellow at UC Berkeley,"I am a student of UC Berkeley and I attended a talk from Micron at the university (if mods want proof I can give). Obviously, I have calls and shares at the company like y'all, so I took lots of notes during the presentation and hope you guys will enjoy. TLDR at bottom.

* Out of 35000 Employees there are 4 Senior Fellows. The presenter was a Senior Fellow.
* Interns say that their work is super impactful to the company.
* Sanjay and university recruiter are from UCB and favor the university. More nerds = better company
* Moving up hierarchy to memory sub systems. 7th largest semiconductor. 3rd largest memory.
* Micron provides infrastructure to big companies like Apple or Google to store and pull data. Data is currency of business.
* 20,000+ patents overall.
* Only competitor with companies and business all over the world. Samsung is in Korea. Toshiba in Japan.
* Industry trends
* Compute and Networking - Biggest growth is in data centers
* Embedded - Autos using Micron memory increasingly
* Storage - NAND flash memory displacing HDD in data centers. Mobile using DRAM and flash storage
* 5 years ago Micron was only in memory and fast storage. Now into primary storage, software, platform.
* 3D Xpoint, their new memory technology with Intel, has good middle between DRAM and NAND cost vs latency. It’s the newest technology after 25 years when NAND was invented.
* Data generation increasing exponentially. For example, viewing a video makes its data go from DRAM to NAND in system then to the cloud in a data center’s DRAM then its NAND.
* Artificial intelligence requires either in your own devices or in the cloud data centers. Cloud latency too high so self-driving cars require in device memory, which Micron makes.
* Currently in AI cars we have ADAS technology. In 2020+ there will be autonomous driving. Senior Fellow was very bullish on this. Needs 4x storage 6x memory.
* Google uses tensor PU; Apple uses neural PU instead of CPU GPU for AI. All these consume lots of data fast. Training and models are huge and cannot be stored purely in memory.
* Their R&amp;D are looking at doing processing in memory for AI. Even further is analog compute, directly on memory.
* Qualcomm Broadcomm Apple don't manufacture silicon, while Micron makes everything from scratch. 
* NAND Flash currently at 3D NAND technology. 3 Generations. Gen 1 32 tiers. Gen 2 64 tiers. Gen 3 96 tiers.
* Memory technology is so volatile and prices increased so much because the cyclical prices are supply demand driven. Previously, companies would invest and oversupply during high prices, driving the prices down a lot and eventually destroying multiple companies. It takes 5-10b to build a new supply factory. Nowadays manufacturers are disciplined. Do not oversupply during highs. 
* Historically there were more companies less stability. Hedge funds hedge against downturn with low Price/Earnings multiple. Now there are 4 stable companies that are not oversupplying and creating volatility. Senior Fellow thinks MU should trade at 15 P/E.

TLDR: AI technology and Data centers are the future and need lots of memory. 3D Xpoint is also a technology to be bullish over. Hedge funds trade MU at a low P/E multiple because they think the industry is volatile, but Senior Fellow thinks that it has become a lot more stable and disciplined, so it should trade at a 15 P/E.",Shivin302,1535304492,119,83,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9ah9qu/notes_from_micron_talk_from_a_senior_fellow_at_uc/

TNDM Challenges on this stock Or Growth,"  

TNDM has nice pull back yesterday, planning to take more (deep dive) on Monday if it falls again. Before taking more, just wanted to share the details.

I recently came across this TNDM Stock. It went down from peak $300 to as low as $5 (I think reverse split happened), now recovered to $38.

Some of the positives:

* They are the lowest Mcap of all competitors like MDT, DXCM(partner), PODD, JNJ
* They floated secondary offer, got 115M and paid off their debt $94M (appx) have excess 20M for operation cash flow. This diluted shares at $28.5, but jumped to $38 now.
* Got FDA approval recently for T:Slim products, commercialization started since Aug 2018 onwards. They are able to make a software to work with DXCM products
* Year over year sales improved, and making losses, but losses narrowed.
* With debts removed by follow on offer, and having slightly excess cash for operations, there is likely turn around profit by end of this year.
* This equipment is lifesaving / extending category and Continuous Glucose Monitoring technology is important. Type 1 diabetes market is increasing.
* Institutional holdings are appx 62%
* In Q1 2018, it shipped 4,444 insulin pumps, up 58% year over year, and its sales totaled $27.3 million, up 44% year over year. Over the past 12 months,Tandem Diabetes sales were $116 million.
* Tandem Diabetes is guiding for sales of between $132 million to $140 million, up 23% to 30% from 2017, but I suspect that forecast will increase now that the FDA's given its automated insulin system the OK.

Some of the negatives:

* If competitors like MDT or JNJ or any other makes similar product, in next 6 months, sales may get impact.
* Even though TNDM made some break through, they are no match (in sales) against MDT , the biggest challenger
* Cash burn must be stopped by increase in sales, which is one or two years away.
* Skeptical/scared because of the way it jumped from $5 to $35 (bit follow on offer was 28.5 subscribed nicely)
* Overall, Tandem Diabetes' opportunity is big enough to have me thinking it is a stock worth buying, however, it and Medtronic will not have this market all to themselves forever.

Facebook's Comeback? DD Inside,"Miss the boat on NVDA? Well don't be sad, fellow autist, because next week is a new week. A new week for you to lose another 35% of your portfolio, come to terms with your autistic (and rapidly devaluing) $90 MU calls, and long $ROPE. Today I am writing up about FaceBook (FB), which was recently rammed in the ass after Q2 earnings. Here's my take on why there is a short term, high profitability play in store, and why the Z u c c will offer us his precious tendies. 

**Technical Analysis** 
1. [Bear Pennant pattern formation](https://gyazo.com/c24eebdc543f314ee57a49ab37c5687f) - Simply put, as long as we can safely jump off of the ~$171 support line (and not have a bearish breakout), I see a short term breakout as high as the low $190's in the next month. I will go into more detail as to why I don't see us having a bearish breakout later on. 

2. [MACD](https://gyazo.com/8f63aec72b200644a2580d1e1986f122) &amp; [RSI](https://gyazo.com/8ae20c9a243bd2bf2bc568b439366d96) - Both the MACD and RSI have been pretty strong indicators of trend reversals when it comes to FB, and I see no reason why this would be any different. The MACD line has just crossed the signal line (bullish indicator) and RSI has bounced off of the 30 line and is approaching neutral strength (currently 47 ish). Historically, when FB has shifted momentum like this, it's held onto bullish momentum (at least enough to sell well in the green). 

**Fundamental Analysis**
FB is, by far, the largest player in the social media industry. They are well diversified (FB, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus VR, [See Full](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook)) within the industry... they are certainly not a ""one pony show."" Quite aggressive profit machines, I still see a massive amount of upside. If you had to ask me, the selloff was justified, but simply left FB oversold. Expect this drop to signify a key support line that we seem to be bouncing away from. In the long haul, the experts [are still bullish](https://postanalyst.com/2018/08/24/technical-roundup-on-two-stocks-facebook-inc-fb-geron-corporation-gern/) as well. 

Keep in mind that we are in the largest bull run in history. Judge Facebook's performance against the S&amp;P and you will see an even more staggering signal to buy. FB is not going anywhere, and there is a lot of money to be made if you time your buys and sells right. 

**Conclusion:**
Try buying FB as close to the low $170's as possible. I expect this play to unfold within the next 2 weeks or so but buy a month out to be safe. Mix up some FDs and ITM options with stock if you swing like that. Fin",MrHindoG,1535252686,50,68,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9acjs1/facebooks_comeback_dd_inside/

Saturday Short: $ZN - Zion Oil and Gas,"Good morning losers, 

I present you the best short on the market other than Tesla. $ZN

This shitty company has somehow existed for 18 fucking years on the thesis of drilling for oil in Israel. With zero revenue to date, Zion has raised capital by advertising via televangelists, claiming they will fulfill a biblical prophesy. This can be seen by the massive marketing expenses in their 10k. 

Their employees then embezzle most of this money with ludicrous salaries. Of the 33 employees in the company, the median salary is 139k, with the CEO bringing home 450k/year. Over the years, they have taken home 17% of all capital raised. 

Earlier this year, Zion made claims that their well #5 had struck oil, and would asses the commercial viability over the next few weeks. Some three months later, Zion announced the well had proven to be commercially unsuccessful and would need capital to move forward in drilling more wells. 

Zion has been able to raise capital via equity dilution over the last 18 years, but has run into headwinds with an SEC investigation at their door. This requires them to disclose the investigation as a part of any equity raise. Now the company has roughly $8m of cash on the books, 6.7m of it earmarked for current liabilities. The company is also entangled in a class action lawsuit which could result in another couple million in liability. On top of it all, the company maintains burn-rate of roughly 2m a quarter. 

With the stock down 80% off it’s 2018 highs, the stock currently sits a 1.53. Given the inevitability of delisting/and or bankruptcy, the $1 puts for any maturity are an attractive purchase. My personal strategy is to own an assortment of puts from Sep18 to Mar19. 

TLDR: $ZN has no revenue, and exists by selling stock to gullible bible belters  SEC now involved, stock going to 0.

Long Hershey Co ($HSY). Selling $88k worth of BRK.B to buy in.,"So as you know, many cities are banning the use of plastic straws. Metal straws are a no go because they would be expensive, and paper straws are stupid because when paper gets wet it becomes soft and can’t hold its shape. This is where Hersheys comes in. Currently, they manufacture Twizzlers, and while being able to use it as a straw is not the main draw, it works great as one! And you can eat it 🤤🤤🤤!

So as more cities ban straws, more restaurants will buy Twizzlers to replace the plastic straws!! 👍 LONG $HSY

$AMDA can we talk? DD inside.,"Can we talk about $AMDA? Due to metal wear in medical implants causing metal poisoning, plastic parts causing bone loss and silicon nitride being biofriendly material, killing bacteria and promoting bone fusion I think it may be only a matter of time before silicon nitride catches momentum in spine joint and dental implants. Especially factoring the netflix documentary ""bleeding edge"" exposing the metal poisoning issue. Revision surgery for these complications are estimated at $10 billion a year in a $140 billion dollar medical implant market. The danger here is the reverse split and it's important to call the bottom before entry. My theory on bottom is based on a 15 million public offering recently closed. Don't really want to go into why I believe this indicates bottom as it's speculation. So i\`m only putting in enough I\`m completely safe with losing expecting to lose everything to revers splits and maintain strong hands. With the recent offering this should have a 35M  share  float so an estimated value of 17.5 million at .50 cents a share for the entire company(my maximum target buy price). The supposed brass ring of a $140 billion dollar industry. I can agree with this math, from what i've heard speculated, that this could translate into  a large profit, possibly on Buy out and share conversion. Obviously, looking at the ticker, This would require very strong hands to not get shook and I suggest minimizing risk here to a very small long bet. Seems like alot of Money invested into a solid material in initial public offering can be picked up off the trading room floor here for pennies on the dollar. Just hard to believe looking at the ticker and having to spend the time Deep diving the Research studies to ever consider a long hold here for the normies on wall street. I could literally talk your ear off about the material science and stock market dynamics until your eyes glazed over.

"L Brands $LB (Victoria's Secret) - The Real ""DD""","Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands $LB shares are down 48% year-to-date and 67% from all-time-highs. The company reports earnings this Wednesday after market close, and is primed for a pop from the low following strong retail sector numbers earlier this week. 

L Brands has moved sharply downwards over the past two years as ""real beauty"" trends have pushed both retail competitors and institutional investors away from 'idealized' models and 'male-focused' lingerie products. This trend can only move so far however, and while larger sizes certainly exist, investors seem to have forgotten that Vic Secret holds a dominant brand and moat-protected competitive positioning in small-sized products aimed at younger women. The VS Fashion show is unrivaled among corporate names in viewership, and the list of names employed as Angels total a combined 100m followers on instagram. Additionally, overt feminist trends have stalled and begun to reverse in the Trump era.  

The stock currently trades at a tiny 6x P/E ratio, a number usually reserved for dead and dying companies. $LB however has posted 8% revenue growth its last quarterly, and has recently expanded into China with a huge flagship store in Shanghai, targeting overseas demand for American brand name products.

Some privileged info on $AAXN,"This is my first post on WSB (I've been a lurker for a long time), so this post is probably not even worth reading and it's definitely not worth betting any of your hard-won tendies on the information I detail here. But for those idiots who are still willing to read this, here you go:

**Public Info** 

&gt;Axon Enterprise has been on an absolute tear this year. At its peak in July it was up almost 200% YTD. Their EPS the last 3 quarters have been great. CEO Rick Smith plans to grow the company 10x over the next 10 years and by all indications that goal is totally achievable. As the public demands more accountability from LE officers in the field the use of body cams and other recording devices continues to go up. Eventually every cop in the US will have a body cam recording at all times and there's good reason to believe that the vast majority of those body cams will be made by Axon. Axon even offers an exchange program that allows LE to exchange any other brand of body cam in any condition for a brand new Axon cam, which brings more and more departments under their umbrella. They are the #1 player in the body cam industry, and they increased their market share considerably when they acquired their biggest competitor, VieVu, back in the spring of this year. Axon is absolutely dominating the law enforcement space and all signs point to them continuing to do so for the foreseeable future. In addition to their SaSS and body cam revenue, people tend to forget that Axon essentially has a monopoly on Less-Than-Lethal electroshock weapons. Their Tasers use patented Neuromuscular incapacitation to effectively rob people of their ability to control their muscles. The word ""tase"" has become synonymous with any use of any electroshock gun. Essentially Taser is the ""Coca-Cola"" of the LTL weapons industry.

**My Not-So-Public Info**

&gt;As of writing this post Axon has contracts with nearly 50 of the 66 largest metropolitan police departments in the country. That number is continuing to rise. Evidence.com subscriptions are skyrocketing as more and more departments outfit their officers with body cams, car cams, etc... They're willing to discount their physical products to rope LE departments into long-term Evidence.com contracts. In certain cases Axon will literally give away body cams to departments in exchange for multi-year SaSS contracts that bring in TONS AND TONS of revenue. Their internal ""Be Scrappy"" initiative has resulted in lots of bloat being eliminated from budgets, which is partially responsible for their recent better than estimated ERs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now lets talk about Tasers specifically. Unfortunately there are cases where particular individuals (i.e. people on PCP) are able to fight and overcome the effects of the Taser and thus officers tend to forego the Taser in favor of a lethal option when they are confronted with such individuals. Axon plans to change that soon with the release of the ""Taser 7"". This will be the most powerful Taser ever, so powerful in fact, that employees of Axon are forbidden from engaging in ""Voluntary Exposure Classes"" with the Taser 7. Internally they are saying that the Taser 7 ""solves the PCP problem"". In Axon's quest to ""make the bullet obsolete"" the Taser 7 is a huge step forward. LE departments all over the country will be falling over themselves to purchase crates of these weapons. The better LTL options officers have, the less they have to worry about pulling their gun and all of the social and legal risks that come along with that these days. Almost every cop has a Taser, and most major departments will pay to upgrade all of their Tasers to the Taser 7. If you don't see dollar signs just thinking about all of the new revenue that will flow in from existing Axon clients for this, then you're not thinking.

**Prediction**

&gt;Good Q3 earnings with a slump in Q4 as departments looking to upgrade by then will most likely wait until the new year when new budgets take effect. Currently, most departments know that come 2019 they'll be able to get the Taser 7 as part of Axon's ""Passport Program"" and save money by bundling their upgrades together.

This information is 100% accurate, and comes directly from a source at Axon. I could've made it all up, but I'm a fat, unemployed, guy behind a keyboard so if I actually was creative and smart enough to fabricate this information I would probably have a job deep frying something.

Anyways, from where I'm standing, it looks like free money. I've got long and medium-term calls on this baby. It'll probably run strong for a few months, Q4 ER isn't until February.",mtchmadeinheaven,1534772052,134,98,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/98tm9h/some_privileged_info_on_aaxn/
"Stock Price Aside, Micron is the Real Deal:","**F3Q18:**

* Micron reported revenue of $7.8bn, which grew 6.1% QoQ. Revised guidance raised to $7.7bn-$7.8bn (their original guidance was $7.2bn-$7.6bn)
* NAND Revenue grew to $1.93bn (+7% QoQ). Flat QoQ growth in bit shipments offset by 7% increase in QoQ ASP
* GM grew to 60.9% up 250bps QoQ

**Memory Sustainability:**

*Rising Capital Intensity:* Moore’s law is slowing down and supply growth is becoming more expensive. Bits per wafer growth to continue to decelerate as transitions are also taking longer.

[https://imgur.com/a/FDBGJqf](https://imgur.com/a/FDBGJqf)

*Cost Declines are Structurally Declining:* DRAM cost declines have moderated from historic Moore’s law cadence of 30% per year to 10%-15%. 

[https://imgur.com/a/xfyBPri](https://imgur.com/a/xfyBPri)

*Node Transitions Adding Fewer Bits:* Supply growth from node transitions is now below demand for both DRAM and NAND. Capacity additions will be needed going forward in order to meet demand requirements.

[https://imgur.com/a/CMlm5L4](https://imgur.com/a/CMlm5L4)

*DRAM and NAND Supply Models:* NAND y/y bit growth peaks in late C3Q/C4Q with 64-layers cross over, the move to 96-layers is likely to be difficult and even at equivalent yields produce fewer incremental bits per wafer. While DRAM y/y bit growth doesn’t peak until C2Q19, 1-y shrinks are only yielding \~8% bit growth/wafer, implying the need to increase wafers \~10%/annum to meet demand – since CY13 wafer adds have only been \~1%/annum.

*Increasing Memory ROI:* To be clear, the structural growth in memory that I am arguing is NOT free of cyclical risk – the fundamental mismatch between capacity additions and the demand curves for which the capacity is being added has and will always lead to periods of digestion. In addition, with the rising longer-term importance of memory, and the rising pricing over the last 12 months – it is prudent to believe that end customers have bought ahead at least modestly. However, absolute CapEx levels, rising capital intensity and increasing memory content per unit of compute support softer landings, higher highs and higher lows. The risk to the memory cycle is macro demand, not bottom-up supply.

*Growing Importance of Memory:* With a slowing of (1) Moore’s Law, (2) Denard Scaling, (3) instruction level parallelism, and (4) the impact of Amdahl’s Law – fundamental transistor utilization (memory bound), is becoming critical to incremental system-level performance improvements. New applications like AI, are significantly more memory intensive with logic/memory ratio moving from \~1-to\~1 in PCs/Handsets to x-to-x in a standard server and 11-1 in a deep learning sever.

**Strong Core End Market Growth:**

MU continues to expect exponential data growth with a projected rev of $150bn by 2018, up from $38bn during the PC/Internet 2000-2007. By 2021, the company could see 62 zettabytes (62k GB) of data up from vs. \~250GB created annually from 2000-2007. By core end market: Autos represents $5.9b (\~24% CAGR); Data Centers represents $62b (\~21% CAGR); IoT represents $16b (\~16% CAGR); andMobile represents $54b (5% CAGR) by CY21.

[https://imgur.com/a/qKrnFOm](https://imgur.com/a/qKrnFOm)

**Declining DRAM and NAND Pricing?**

DRAMexchange keeps reporting that ASP is declining. Applied Materials just reported earnings and they stated that this is not true. However, if this were true, it's expected. Production costs are declining faster than the ASP.

**TL;DR-** It's ridiculous how cheap this stock is getting. I've been buying since $57 and it's a joke at this point. Even if it drops further, I'm not going to risk the opportunity to own this company. 20% of their shares will be retired in addition to 50% of FCF going forward. Management is incredibly confident in their company. Moore's Law is slowing down and cloud is growing faster than we can fathom. Long MU.

1. ATVI = slipped below that 200 MA of 69.85, will wait for reclamation of that area to jump in. Quarters 3/4 are usually the strongest for this company so don't be surprised if this has a nice rally towards the end of the year. Keep this one on watch. 
2. CGC = was struggling around that 50MA, and we saw two red days before \[[https://finance.yahoo.com/m/db18f06e-0c05-3415-8f94-85cb4f6a2aa0/cannabis-company-canopy.html?.tsrc=rss](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/db18f06e-0c05-3415-8f94-85cb4f6a2aa0/cannabis-company-canopy.html?.tsrc=rss)\](this news)  hit. For now, I will be watching to see if we can get another breakout above 37, and then a retest of that resistance to be support (probably gonna take some time on this one). If you are interested in marijuana stocks check out the ETFs, i do think they will be the better play in the long run. 
3. BIDU = had a nice bounce right off that support line, and this is my top watch next week. I think the Chinese market will bounce back, and BIDU very well could lead the way. I think that the google hype is an over-reaction for now, because it would take years for this competition to take affect. This is a strong stock, that is being beaten down by the trade war/chinese economy right now. Keep this on high watch. (remember there is no such thing as an ""expensive"" stock.)
4. TEAM = stilling waiting for that breakout, looking like a possible flag forming, but i would just watch this one for now. 

Hope you all enjoy the update, and next sunday I will have another brand new post with new tickers to watch. This week is gonna be hectic for me. 

By the way my current portfolio positions are 

PAVM - Highly suggest DDing this company. Am Long on it.

BZUN - Great company, great earnings, being beaten up by the Chinese market fears. Long also here.

holding a lot of cash also ready on hand. ",coquinaa,1534692459,40,23,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/98l08r/here_is_an_update_from_my_watchlist_last_week/

Want tendies? Go right to the source. DD inside.,"Alright you chodes and chodettes lets do some DD. If you want to print tendies with hunny mussy you have to go right to the source. No I’m not talking about MU 90 Faggys or even call puts on companies with negative P/E ratios, I’m talking about Darling Ingredients. More than half of their revenue comes from feed ingredients that other companies are buying to shove down chickens throats so us fags can eat tendies. This quarter they increased their margins and strong slaughter activity drove the global tonnage up 5.6%.  So why should you buy Darling Ingredients? Feeder cattle is up 7.5% this year. Poultry is up 10.5%. These increased prices will likely lead to an increased demand for feed to fatten those bitches up for slaughter. As populations grow and developing countries gain wealth they all tend to eat more meat. You could buy Archer Danials or Tyson for exposure to rising prices and demand for protein based products but Darling has one advantage over them. Exposure to fish farms(Archer Danials does produce some animal feed but it accounted for only 8 million in 2nd quarter 2018 revenue). Fish is the most consumed, produced and traded source of protein in the world by a long shot and fish farms are the way of the future. Currently, a significant amount of fish protein and and fish oils come from aquaculture byproduct and from wild caught Menhaden. These ingredients are then turned into feed pellets for fish farms. However, the wild caught Menhaden is not a sustainable source and has highly regulated catch volumes set years in advance. Eventually we aren’t going to be able to get wild caught fish since there simply won’t be enough to go around and all the demand will shift onto other sources such as the ones offered by Darling Ingredients. All of these factors are going to outweigh any of cheeto mans tariffs. When China inevitably gives in and ends the trade war Darling ingredients is going to see a nice boost. ATM calls are dirt cheap so lets make some ez tendies.

TLDR: Populations are growing. Animals gotta eat so people can eat the animals. ",howmynutstaste,1534605639,17,9,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/98cf7n/want_tendies_go_right_to_the_source_dd_inside/

Understanding Micron's Decline (It's Bullish),"Like most people here, I share your pain in seeing the decline of our beloved Micron Technology (MU). At its current valuation, it is trading at a PE of 4.80 and a forward-PE of 4.06. It's price/book is now under 2, and its price/FCF is 5.19. We all know how undervalued the company is, but that's not what I want to drill home today. I want to drill home the volatility of the stock and its buyback, which hopefully will start as close to 9/25 as possible.

**Let's Start With Volatility:**

For your viewing pleasure, I went ahead and attached a chart of Micron since November of last year. In less than a year, Micron has had many 6 drops of 15% or more. The point I am trying to make is that while this current drop is killing us all, it is in Micron's nature to do such a thing. Micron doesn't trade like Apple (slowly up 0.3% daily and climbs). It is a volatile stock that runs 15% in a week, and then drops 2% per day afterwards. If you're playing this stock, you have to be ok with this level of volatility.

[https://imgur.com/a/lbpY4JU](https://imgur.com/a/lbpY4JU)

**The Buybacks and EPS:**

Let's assume that each share is being bought back for $49.50 each (in reality it could be more or less, but that's what we are using for this example).

$10,000,000,000 / $49.50 = 202,020,202. They can repurchase roughly 200mm shares.

They current have 1,159,765,000 shares outstanding.

1,159,765,000 / 202,020,202 = 5.74. This mean Micron can get approximately 20% of the company off the market.

Analysts are talking about ""storm clouds"" and reduction in DRAM prices, which would lead to less revenue. However, due to the buyback, Micron can artificially increase their EPS by buying back shares.

**TL;DR-** Micron historically has dropped 15% or more this year alone. Buybacks will increase EPS even if sales decline.",itschrisolson,1534435327,20,28,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/97tjsg/understanding_microns_decline_its_bullish/

A warning to all you chaps,"So as we all know (because we all watch CNBC), the Turkish Lira is having a terrible time, its in crisis. And I'm sure you've heard people comparing this situation to the 1997 Thai Bhat debacle,  well it's because these two are enormously similar. If you look back at the causes of the Bhat devaluation you'll notice that the stem of the bubble occured from an immense amount of foreign debt and investment specifically from the U.S. using the U.S. dollar. Well what popped this bubble, not the sudden announcement of tariffs, no it was the strength of the dollar as Alan Greenspan rose rates to slow inflation. However as you can see the root of the problem in both scenarios is the strength of the U.S. dollar making investments in the U.S. far more attractive. Causing in both cases a drawout of U.S. capital, now I know what thinking ""TaRiFFs dOn'T RaISe ThE VaLuE oF THe DOllaR"" well autist you're right. However because of no reason I can figure out  the dollar has be consistently gaining value as of late despite some minor some shifts which has destroy the lira for the better part of a year and this was last the straw. So why should we worry about Turkey; the same reason we needed to keep a careful eye on Thailand. Thailand caused a contagion that smashed the asian emerging markets, Turkey is completely capable of doing the same thing to other emerging markets.... like china.  As money leaves Turkey it isn't reallocated to other emerging markets, in fact what tends to happens is the exact opposite  the whole emerging market sector takes a hit as people reduce their exposure for fear the strength of the dollar could spark another EM collapse. Well guess whose in that EM sector, china a crony capitalist country that has so much corporate leverage it makes Dick Fuld cum if the U.S. dollar continues to rise and money leaves this could spell disaster for china and as a result the U.S. stock market, because despite what Trump says we do a ton of business with china (and its not just soybeans) they need our products and if the dollar rises the yuan falls and especially if the U.S. investment leaves the average chinese worker is going to become suddenly much poorer and not able to buy Murican products.

Long $TUR,"As most of you know, $TUR is down a ton in recent weeks and is dragging the market down with it, which I can only imagine is because $TUR inventory is currently near all time highs. The strange thing is that this is highly cyclical and happens every year, with the vast majority of revenue on Turkey sales being generated in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving (cycle varies slightly each year depending on when Thanksgiving falls). 

I think this may be market manipulation, and $TUR should run up before Thanksgiving starting in early September when the manipulators buy back in low.

Semiconductor Theory,"Preface: I have no idea what I’m doing

This week, I’ve seen the sentiment on semiconductors go from bullish as fuck on Sunday to bearish tuck-our-dicks-in Wednesday right now. Whatever, normal movement... right?

It seems that all this money bleeding out of semiconductors is only moving because MANY OF THE BANKS simultaneously decided to release reports that pretty much fuck the semiconductor market, with NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. 

That last part is key, as it seems like they just all got in a room and hired a hit on semis.

This week, AMAT and NVDA see their earnings, two of the industry leaders, and semiconductor sentiment was at probably near an ATH at the end of last week. A day before earnings for both of them... and we’re seeing a huge discount. Seems fucky to me.

TL;DR: seems like the banks caused the semiconductor drop to synthetically create a buying-in point that’s to their liking.

*trigger warning* Bearish DD,"# Warning: Bearish DD

*Hello Wallstreetbets. Before you downvote me for being a bearfag, hear me out. I am not a bear, I am a panda. A Panda is a retarded version of both a bull and a bear. I have bullish and bearish tendencies, but am neither a full bearfag or a bullfag (and I own JD).* 

Alright so here is what this DD is. Its basically just a bunch of fucking numbers that show overvaluedness compared to previous markets. To be honest, overvalued is just a buzzword used by fags at Morgan Stanley who think they are hot shit (storm clouds REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE). It could mean something, or it could mean horseshit. Draw your own conclusions retards. 

Alright, now that we are done with the disclaimers. For the past nine years, the equities market has seen one of the best percent gains since the Bull Market of 1948-1969. Corporate taxes are low, GDP growth is strong, and joblessness well below the Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU).

However, quite a few ratios, economic data, and past performances are pointing to the conclusion that this bull market is close to its conclusion. For all data, I will be using the S&amp;P 500 Index. Sorry Dow Jones and Nasdaq. Nobody loves you (well I love Nasdaq fuck Dow).

**Buffet Indicator**

Not to be confused with the Buffet Rule, the Buffet Indicator compares the Total Market Capitalization (Market Cap) of the stock market divided by the Total GDP.

|Ratio = Total Market Cap / GDP|Valuation|
|:-|:-|
|Ratio &lt; 50%|Significantly Undervalued|
|50% &lt; Ratio &lt; 75%|Modestly Undervalued|
|75% &lt; Ratio &lt; 90%|Fair Valued|
|90% &lt; Ratio &lt; 115%|Modestly Overvalued|
|Ratio &gt; 115%|Significantly Overvalued|

As of 8/1/18, the Total Market Cap is 142.8% more than the total GDP. This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a “Fairly Valued” TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half.

[29.3 Trillion in Total Market Cap vs. 20.4 Trillion in GDP.](https://i.redd.it/i81rjdd2l3g11.png)

**Shiller P/E Ratio**

The Shiller P/E Ratio is a better measure of valuation than normal P/E. It accounts for the fluctuations of inflation due to the business cycle, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the true value of the security. Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.

Shiller P/E Ratio over the past 120\~ Years.

[The grey bars mark U.S Recessions. Note 1929, 2001, and 2008.](https://i.redd.it/lj5fxu76l3g11.png)

MEAN: 16.9 (We are currently 53% above the mean, indicating an overvalued market.)

MIN: 4.78 (DEC 1920)

MAX: 44.19 (Dec 1999)

RANGE: 39.41

**Price To Sales (Revenue) Ratio**

The Price to Sales Ratio (PSR), like the P/E ratio, is a way of measuring value. Instead of comparing a company’s price to earnings, it compares a company’s stock price to its revenues. 

|Price/Revenue Per Share|Valuation|
|:-|:-|
|PSR = 0-1|Undervalued|
|PSR= 1-2|Fairly Valued|
|PSR= 2-3|Overvalued|
|PSR= 3+|Significantly Overvalued|

(Again valuation is bullshit, but it can be a good estimate). 

The current for the S&amp;P500 is 2.23, and at the height of the tech bubble, 2.44, indicating overvaluation. The chart below shows that until the late 90s, P/S never topped 1.3.

S&amp;P500 Price to Sales 1955-2006

S&amp;P 500 by Deciles 1986-Present

[Tesla is in the top Decile](https://i.redd.it/3aiiorzkl3g11.png)

The graph above shows the S&amp;P grouped into deciles (each of ten equal groups into which a population can be divided according to the distribution of values of a particular variable (in this case Price to Sales Ratio)). Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&amp;P is the most overvalued it has ever been.

**Yield Curve**

Now we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates. It is a crucial market sentiment indicator about the future of the economy.

The normal yield curve shows that the shorter the maturity, the lower the yield.

https://i.redd.it/cetz1hmol3g11.png

The flat yield curve indicates a transition from an expansion to a downturn. Shorter maturities have the same yields as the

longer maturities.

https://i.redd.it/w19g7o1ql3g11.png

The Inverted Yield Curve is a strong indicator of coming recession. Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.

https://i.redd.it/be8wl7krl3g11.png

We are currently in a flat yield curve (kinda).

**Bull Exhaustion** 

Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.

*Processing img x93mkfkul3g11...*

The failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&amp;P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.

**Dow Theory (the Public)**

Dow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn’t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The “Market Trends” part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.

1. Accumulation Phase

a. In the beginning of the bull market “In the know” investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.

2. Public Participation Phase

a. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.

3. Distribution Phase

a. The final stage of the bull market. The “in the know” investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur “investors” through apps like Robinhood can now easily speculate with options and margin.

https://i.redd.it/e2bf5ppvl3g11.png

I believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.

Anyway. Draw your own conclusions. This is my first DD. Feedback and criticism (pls dont call me fag) is welcome.

"Here is my watchlist for next week, feel free to use it. Cheers","**Week of , August 13th– Swing Trades Watchlist,** **Technical Analysis ONLY**

1.  **ATVI – ACTIVISION**  

o Saw a large drop after earnings report, beat on EPS, very possible an over-reaction (3 day rule), after the drop we saw it hit the 200SMA near 70$, with the dip under that MA being bought, with 2 consecutive green closes after. Good risk/reward in this area.

o Entry would be in the area that it is in now, 70-71, would be small, and would want to scale on the way up if the trend holds.

o Mental stop loss would be under that 200SMA around 69$ (maybe even a tad lower) so that you wouldn’t get shaken out by an MM sweep. If it goes under that 200SMA, I wouldn’t touch it, would wait to see where the floor is.

o Resistances to watch would be 73, 75 (65SMA), 76 (50MA), 80, and then watch for the high break of 82.

o Support to watch is only that 200MA, otherwise I would be a spectator. 

o Will keep this on high watch Monday morning to see what the market does, If I enter it would be SMALL and I would respect the stop loss/mental if it doesn’t work out. Plan your trade accordingly! 

**2.**  **CGC – CANOPY GROWTH**

o One of the many marijuana stocks trying to get a piece of the pie with the upcoming legalization in Canada this fall

o Was only watching this stock because it was getting close to reclaiming that 50SMA (28.75), however on Friday, it hit that 50MA and bounced off, and closed red. 

o Will watch to see what happens around that 50SMA, and ONLY take a position if it can break and hold that 50MA.

o If it were able to re-claim and hold that 50SMA, I would use that area as an entry, and a mental stop loss, similar to ATVI. This is ONLY if it can re-claim that 50SMA. Keep this on watch for the next couple weeks, could see a nice run if it can re-claim that 50SMA to the double top high of 36.50. 

**3.**  **BIDU – BAIDU (“GOOGLE OF CHINA”)**

o This is one of my favorite “expensive” (don’t like that word) stocks that I keep on my watch list. It is finally back in the buying range (look at the 1/2/3 year chart to understand the patterns).

o It is near that support of 220-215 that I have been watching for, played this last time in was in the 220s

o Has seen this drop because of the competition that GOOG could be bringing into China, which BIDU hasn’t faced before.

o Has strong support in the 215-220 range, where 216 was the previous resistance (zoom out and youll see). 

o This is gonna be a high watch for me this week to see what happens, if I enter it will be in this range that it is currently in, with a mental stop loss near the 210-205 range, which if it broke, would tell me that this move is done and it is going back to the old support/resistance (zoom out!).

o Really like the r/R here, potential 15$ loss, for a 60$ gain (resistance is 270-280 (ATH is 284), with a 4/1 ratio. 

**4.**  **TEAM – ATLASSIAN CORP**

o This stock has been a monster recently, up over 100% inless than a year, but don’t let that scare you!

o After the earnings beat, we saw the old resistance (69) obligterated, with the stock hitting a 52 week high of 79.82. 

o Since that we have seen a pullback back into that 69 resistance area, which was then converted into the support area. Therefore the trend is still in tact and I will be watching this closely.

o Ill be specifically watching to see if that 52 week high can be broken, currently at 78$, or if it cant be broken, watching for another pullback towards the 69$ range. 

o If it breaks that 52 week high, watch for the pullback back to the 79-80 range to see if that acts as support

o Most likely will not be entering a position this week, but I think this is a great stock to keep an eye on for the near future and what these next few weeks can bring us. Watch those sup/res levels closely.

Random Biotech DD - $TTPH,"Just some degenerate who has occasional good DD, haven't posted any in a while.  Going to do a nice little write up on $TTPH.  Pulled up the Biotech Calendar for FDA events and randomly scrolled for a second and stopped on this is one that I saw coming towards the end of the month, so it'll give you faggots some time to review and decide.  I have no idea if my DD will signal buy or sell, haven't looked at this company at all yet.  Just going to roll with it and type as I go.  I'm also the one trying to put together a site that will have the FDA calendar along with DD of upcoming events.  I'm retarded with websites though and work, so it wont be up for several weeks probably.  Hopefully I dont fuck up this format.  Note: I don't have a position in this, like I said, I just picked some random event coming up and started typing.  Hopefully I can make sense through my bourbon.  



#*Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals*


# *Who Are They?*

Some biotech company that researches ways to get around potential antibiotic resistance. They create antibiotics to combat bacterial infections, including those caused by many of the multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.  This is shit like E. coli and Chlamydia which are resistant to some forms of current antibiotics because they mutate too efficiently (fuck you evolution).  So for all you degenerate hooker loving faggots out there, I guess its a relatable company.

They have been around for 12 years and their leadership team looks like a bunch of cucks, unlike Musk dady.  One of the fuckers is cross eyed, can't trust em.  So we have to divert to the science on this one.  


# *Over View*

They focus on synthetic variations of the Tetracycline, generating over 3,000 unique derivatives and creating a pipeline of novel antibiotics.  Essentially they are a one trick pony.  They seem to do alright at it, but they have the idea that their antibiotics can be used in oncology, but they are hoping for a stretch that really won't likely pan out.  So they focus their efforts on fighting bacteria that are becoming resistant to shit.  These drug-resistant bacteria are immune to the antibiotics society has counted on to treat these infections, causing a global public health crisis and what some have referred to as a “post antibiotic era”.  Of most concern are patients with bacterial infections that are resistant to many/multiple classes of antibiotics; referred to as multidrug-resistant (MDR), pandrug-resistant (PDR), or extremely drug resistant (XDR) bacterial infections.


Bacteria can be broken into two categories, Gram-positive and -negative.  You don't need to know what the fuck that means, just know that the company focuses on Gram-Negative which has been pretty much neglected like a red headed step child.  Gram-Negative (GN I will start calling it) cause most of the current serious infections in hospitals which is roughly 30% of all hospital infections.  Mortality is pretty high due to these infections being resistant to shit, so people just keep dropping.  


They license their tech from Harvard, so its gotta be working right?  Those Ivy League kids in Boston are smarter than those idiots at Yale in shit hole New Haven.  Anyways, Tetracycline has been around for 50 years and now this company is making it fully synthetically allowing it to be adjusted beyond anything that was done before and decrease the ability for bacteria to resist it.  

They use Tetracycline as the core structure and just modify the shit out of it like a Puerto Rican's Honda.  


# *Pipeline*



*Eravacycline*


Flagship product, treats life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) GN Bacteria.  A Fully synthetic tetracycline antibiotic in Phase III for treating intra-abdominal infections and some fucked up UTIs, comes with a side of cranberry juice.  Luckily for this company, the FDA thinks UTI's are serious business and granted these guys both Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations for both indications of use.  Thats pretty sweet they have more than one indication for one drug.  Two birds, one stone.
  

*TP-271*


Used to combat respiratory disease caused by bacteria and pahtogens. The FDA has granted QIDP and Fast Track designations for TP-271 for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, another two birds one stone situation.  Phase I though, so they are testing to see if the shit is safe, we will see later on. They have no news on this shit for a while.



*TP-6076*


Some investigatory drug they are running through Phase I to fight E. coli and a few other bacteria.  Lead candidate to fight a few different of the most urgent GN bacteria threats according to the CDC.  This one seems like they just picked one of the full synthetic versions of Tetracycline they have that they think will be effective and threw it out there.  We wont focus on this fucker, itll probably get through Phase I and be deemed safe like the other drug. 


# *The Real Focus - Eravacycline*



So this bitch is finishing up Phase III in two different studies, IGNITE1 and IGNITE4.  Eravacycline was investigated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) as part of the Company's IGNITE phase III program which comprised of administration to over 1,500 patients. In IGNITE1, a pivotal phase III trial in patients with cIAI, twice-daily IV eravacycline met the primary endpoint by demonstrating statistical non-inferiority of clinical response compared to ertapenem, was well-tolerated and achieved high cure rates in patients with Gram-negative pathogens, including resistant isolates. The IGNITE1 data is serving as the basis of the Marketing Authorization Application  for IV eravacycline for the treatment of patients with cIAI now under review by the European Medicines Agency . In IGNITE4, a second phase 3 clinical trial in patients with cIAI, twice-daily IV eravacycline met the primary endpoint by demonstrating statistical non-inferiority of clinical response compared to meropenem, was well-tolerated and achieved high cure rates. The Company has used the results from IGNITE1 and IGNITE4 to support a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA for IV eravacycline in cIAI. The NDA is currently under review with the FDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of August 28, 2018. In clinical trials to date, eravacycline has been administered to more than 2,700 patients. Eravacycline has not been approved for commercial use.


2,700 patients is quite a few in the clinical trial space.  Typically clinical trials through all phases will at most see around 3500 patients, so hitting a number near 3,000 and proving both safe and effective is pretty critical.  Not only that, bu the FDA seems to be wanting to pass more drugs through the pipeline of approval since Trump's inauguration so this only improves the chances or approval.  They are seeking approval in Europe, which would boos the revenues from the product, but what we really want to see is FDA approval because all the profits are really made in America.  However, that European MAA filing presents a massive stepping stone for the company on their first regulatory application for marketing authorization and pushing them one step closer to market.  Using both Phase III studies which are showing positive results will likely increase the chance of approval by FDA.   Even further, Tetraphase is also currently conducting IGNITE3, an additional phase III trial evaluating once-daily IV eravacycline in patients with cUTI and, assuming a positive outcome, the Company plans to use the results from IGNITE3 to support a supplemental NDA submission for eravacycline in cUTI. In parallel, Tetraphase is continuing its efforts to develop an oral dose formulation of eravacycline. A phase 1 clinical program is ongoing which is designed to evaluate and optimize the oral dosing regimen for eravacycline.

The phase III IGNITE3 results show that the clinical trial enrolled 1,205 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive IV eravacycline (1.5mg/kg every 24 hours) or ertapenem (1g every 24 hours) for a minimum of 5 days, and then were eligible for transition to an appropriate approved oral agent. The co-primary endpoints of responder rate (a combination of clinical cure and microbiological success) in the microbiological intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) population at the end of IV visit and at the test of cure visit (Day 5-10 post therapy) were evaluated using a 10% non-inferiority margin. Responder rates in the micro-ITT population at the end of IV visit were 84.8% and 94.8% for eravacycline (n=363/428) and ertapenem (n=382/403), respectively (-10% CI: -14.1%, -6.0%).  Responder rates at the test of cure visit were 68.5% and 74.9% for eravacycline (n=293/428) and ertapenem (n=302/403), respectively (-6.5% CI: -12.6%, -0.3%).  Some good fuckin results, showing the shit is effective.  Top line reached baby. 

There are probably several of you retards reading going, ""What the fuck is a PDUFA?""  Well its called the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, essentially companies pay money to the FDA towards this shit and it goes into speeding up Drug Approval times.  The PDUFA Dates are deadlines for the FDA to review new drugs and they normally have about 10 months to review them.  If a drug is selected for priority review, FDA has 6 months.  This all starts once the NDA is accepted by the FDA.  This company filed their NDA back on January 2nd, and the FDA accepted the filing on February 27th.  So the FDA has a deadline of August 28th to give their response on the NDA filing, which was given priority review as well as Fast Track designation and some other shit.  

The Phase III data was positive, the primary endpoint was met.  Thats some good fuckin news.  However they are filing for two indications here.  Thats what the fuck is worrying me.  I have seen this before, they are throwing a handful of tacks at a board and hoping one sticks, kind of.  In both indications that they completed studies on, these homies find that the drug is not only effective at what it does, but it also is relatively safe.  Compared to other drugs that are already approved, their compound is found to be no less effective, giving this shit a good case.  


Second Quarter 2018 should bring Eravacycline (apparently its also called Xerava) to market on a global level, like I said Eurotrash countries and Murrica.  They are getting ready for commercial launch upon approval.  They are also working on developing plans in China having recently also submitted an IND to the Chinese FDA.  I bet China and Asia gets fucked hard by GM Bacteria just due to population and lack of excellent healthcare.  So thats a huge market for them if they get approved in Asia.  Anyways, yeah to sum up they will likely see FDA approval in the next month and Commercial launch in Q4 2018.


*FINANCIAL SHIT*

Now these dont really fucking matter for Biotech companies because most of them hemorrhage cash until they get bought out.  But here we go, a layout of their financial situation as of June 30th, 2018.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - $111.2 million

Shares Outstanding - 52.9 million

They expect their cash to last them through Q3 2019, so they wont be looking to raise any capital ASAP.  This is some good fuckin news for people playing the approval.  Unlikely to see a fuckin offering a day after or day of FDA approval if it does happen.  So you will likely see some of the gains hold for months following.  

Q2 reveneues were $11.6 million, compared to $1.6 million last year Q2, a real 10 bagger.   The boys did it.  Although, nearly all of it came from licensing to China which is dope because this shows they can license shit out while also get grant revenue from governments and also should see some revenues flow in following commercialization if the drug is approved Q3-Q4.

R&amp;D expenses are down 50% YoY, mainly due to completion of studies.  However, their expenses on administration are going up a few million YoY.  This is due though to the expectation of commercialization and the company preparing to rake in some cash money.

The company reported last week that they had a net loss of $9.5 million (-$0.18 per share), compared to a net loss of $31.8 million (-$0.83 per share) reported same time in 2017.  They arent losing as much money and are showing good data.  This is tight.


*THE MARKET*

Now you are thinking, how big is this fucking GN bacteria market?  Can some fuckin germs be worth that much?  Well, according to the CDC, antibiotic-resistant infections cause over 23,000 deaths per year.  Fuck, over 2 million people become infected with these tricky fuckers that resist drugs and a bunch more people die due to complications caused by the bacteria resistant to antibiotics.  

This market of antibiotic-resistant bacteria treatments was valued at $26 billion and is expected to reach $44 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 6%.  Thats a good sized market.



#*TLDR*

They make some drugs to fight bacteria which are antibiotic-resistant.  They have 3 drugs in pipeline, but only one we care about now.  They have just over 2 weeks until they get a PDUFA notice from FDA on a NDA filing, hoping to get approval in the US for marketing their drug.  They are seeking Asia, more specifically Chinese, approval and European approval as well in coming months.  They have two different Phase III studies that show efficacy as well as safety in over 2500 patients.  They show that compared to similar compounds, the drug Eravacycline is just as effective as well as maintaining a safe profile.  Shit is going for two different indications which is pretty cool, shows diversity but the FDA can be fickle so it might be possible that only one indication is approved, they change some wording on their studies and label, and I see them getting both indications approved.  The market for their drug is pretty fucking big, going to grow over $40 billion in a few years, and if you follow science at all you know that antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem that needs to be addressed.  Their financials are pretty tight, they have cash to hold them off until end of Q3 2019.  This is the biggest thing to me because the company wont fuck their entire investor base by completing a fucking offering and announcing a dilution to everyone the day of approval.  Their leadership looked dumb in their pictures, they seem smart though because some Harvard connection.  Didnt read about them after seeing a cross eyed fuck.  Their trials have met all endpoints and the company is prepping for commercialization which is reflected in their finances.  This is a good sign and it means they expect approval.  I do too.

My take - They receive approval for at least one indication by August 24th, although I wouldnt be surprised by both indications being approved.  Company looks solid, they have plenty of cash, are ready for marketing their compound, and are reducing debt and spending.  No reason for denial from the FDA in my eyes, no reason for dilution immediately, and their drug was designated Fast Tracked and Qualified Infectious Disease Product, meaning that the FDA thinks that this is an urgent matter and needs to be addressed.  They are likely to approve compounds that receive these designations because if it is safe and can save lives, they will try to pass it, especially under the current environment.  Stock seems to have solid consolidation around $3.00 long term, I would expect this shit to hit $7.00 by September honestly.  I like it.  I approve.  I might buy.


#*Way Too Long Didnt Read*

It looks like a buy.



#*EDIT*

There are comments around the massive drop in 2015.  They have been in Phase III for a while, as this phase does take some time.  But these guys ran 4 different IGNITE studies on their flagship product, and IGNITE2 failed to meet endpoints back in 2015 as an IV to oral transition therapy for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, and failed to prove that it was not inferior to existing products. While it caused concern then, they have initiated and seen success in more IGNITE studies, such as 1 and 3.  These have solid data, meet all endpoints, are safe and effective.  So while they couldnt get a hold of one indication before, it looks like they will for these two indications based off the successful studies.  I think that FDA approval is immanent due to the unmet market need that the company fulfills.  IGNITE2 might have failed, but the other indications are what we are seeking for FDA approval.  Also there are a ton of lawsuits going on apparently, if you check yahoo finance the page is littered with them.  Most of them are just reminders.  In my eyes, they are trying to cause alarm and scare off investors more than anything.  They are holding the basis that the company engaged in more patients in one of its studies to inflate the endpoint data in their favor to prove significant results while also lying about present data.  I doubt that is likely to be proven, so these lawsuits are insignificant. ",Chill_Duck_,1534043250,176,73,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/96m8y0/random_biotech_dd_ttph/

"Get in on the $YEXT big thing - Earnings play, actual DD","This isn't a Seeking Alpha article so I'm gonna try to keep it short-ish Plus some of you would read a TL:DR on a tweet if it was a thing.  

Yext created a whole new market segment called DKM-digital knowledge management. They are a ten year old company which has been public for about a year. Going public allowed them access to capital which let them expand and win many partnerships this year including Yelp, TripAdvisor,Google and Amazon.  It's a simple product. On the surface they allow merchants and businesses to update the information that appears on search engines and review pages.  Under the hood it's a beautiful AI play with rich and complex ramifications.  The digital Knowledge Assistant interacts with companies and let's them know when and how to change their info. For instance if people are searching How many calories in a big Mac on their alexa, the KA will prompt the neighborhood Burger Restaurant to add the info to their website along with their hours of business and whatever else info is pertinent.  

-Management is stellar. Highly ranked on Glassdoor, recently named best place to work by Fortune. Keeps winning partnerships. Last big pop was a big win with Alexa 

-Expected revenue this quarter is 54 million ish. However, due to new features and partnerships I think this is a very conservative estimate.  Good chance of a big beat.  

-Last earnings call they mentioned a line about being worried about capital expenditures due to their spending on annual conference. Now they just announced David friggin Blaine will be entertaining them. Just an aside but I think this speaks as to just how confidant they are going into this report.  

-Company is currently cash flow positive, many catalysts this spring/summer, history of big beats.  

I bought calls and stock.

Edit: Earnings isn't till first week of Sept. Stock is currently range bound by about 5%. Possible to wait for a sale before buying. If you're a masochist and like being glued to your computer can wait till last week and write calls to capture theta/iv

JD is significantly undervalued...,"What is JD.com?

JD.com, Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates as an e-commerce company and retail infrastructure service provider in the People's Republic of China. It operates in two segments, JD Mall and New Businesses. The company offers home appliances; mobile handsets and other digital products; desktop, laptop, and other computers, as well as printers and other office equipment; furniture and household goods; apparel; cosmetics, personal care items, and pet products; women's shoes, bags, jewelry, and luxury goods; men's shoes, sports gears, and fitness equipment; automobiles and accessories; mother and childcare products, toys, and instruments; and food, beverage, and fresh produce. It also provides gifts, flowers, and plants; nutritional supplements; books, e-books, music, movie, and other media products; and virtual goods, such as online travel agency, attraction tickets, and prepaid phone and game cards, as well as consumer electronic products. In addition, the company offers an online marketplace for third-party sellers to sell products to customers; and transaction processing and billing, value-added fulfillment, and other services. Further, it provides online marketing services for suppliers, merchants, and other partners; logistics services for various industries; consumer financing services to individual customers; and supply chain financing services to suppliers and merchants. Additionally, the company offers online-to-offline solutions for customers and offline retailers, as well as online and in-person payment options and customer services. JD.com, Inc. offers its products through its Website jd.com and mobile apps, as well as directly to customers. December, 2017, JD.com operated 7 fulfillment centers and 486 warehouses in 78 cities covering various counties and districts. The company has strategic cooperation agreement with Tencent Holdings Limited and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. JD.com, Inc. is headquartered in Beijing, China. Most recently, Google announced they took a $500mm stake in JD last month. They plan to collaborate on a range of strategic initiatives, including joint development of retail solutions in a range of regions around the world, including Southeast Asia, the U.S. and Europe. By applying JD’s supply chain and logistics expertise and Google’s technology strengths, the two companies aim to explore the creation of next-generation retail infrastructure solutions, with the goal of offering helpful, personalized and frictionless shopping experiences.

Financials:

It’s no joke to say that JD is an expensive stock as it is trading near 200x PE. However, JD is growing exponentially and their PE represents that

The company is currently valued at $52bn and they have $55bn in sales. To put this into perspective, Amazon is valued at $905bn with $177bn in sales. This is roughly 5.11x sales, whereas JD is 0.96x sales. Expected revenue for FY18 is $74.16bn while their EPS is $0.68, which is up 250% YoY. EPS is predicted to grow to over $1.20 next year as well on revenues just shy of $95bn. My point is that JD is still in growth mode, and they have the perfect setup to do it.

For example, I don’t think it would be unreasonable to say that JD could be trading at 2.17x trailing sales, which is a very fair estimate. That would value the company at $89.48/share.",[deleted],1534006877,61,56,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/96i1vr/jd_is_significantly_undervalued/

ROKU write-up,"Well, it's 5:30pm on Friday, I know you fags are all worn out from your 9-5 at Burger King, thought I would give you a little Friday reading.

So ROKU had a killer quarter as most of us know. I have been excited about ROKU for a while now, posting a couple of very optimistic DDs. Posted one DD back at $48 but one of the mods deleted it about 10 minutes later for god knows what reason, so if your bank account is looking a little short this week, that's the reason.

Let's talk about the company:

**The Founder:**

Anthony Wood is this British-born guy who has been in Silicon Valley since the dot com bubble, had a successful exit with his first company ReplayTV(an early Tivo competitor), and proceeded to found ROKU in 2002. To summarize: this guy has been around and successfully building his baby company from nothing to a $5B company for 16 years. That is what I like to see. He has been extraordinarily patient in making his billions. He retains a stake of 27% in the company, so he has some serious skin in the game. He is also a total straight-shooter. Everything I like to see. You bet on the jockey not the horse, and this is one jockey that I would like to ride.

**The business:**

ROKU is a ""sell the hardware, monetize the software"" kind of business. This kind of business is extremely lucrative if done right. Apple would be a good example of this (except that they also make fucktons of money from their hardware). SQ is kind of another example, where they sell their card reader and then try and lock you into their ecosystem. SQ faces competitive pricing from other processors, but on their ecosystem services, the profit has no limits. This is like ROKU, they face competitive pressures on the box, but not on the advertising. ROKU will be able to increasingly squeeze their partners as their market share increases(because it's not the customer who buys the box who pays the cost)..

ROKU is one of these companies that has leveraged their access to the customer in order to build new products that the customer will enjoy. This is the big thing in tech right now; the reason that AGA is so successful, in a nutshell. The main example is the ROKU channel, but more historical examples would include their app store, moving from boxes into sticks and TV licensing, and etc. The ROKU channel was recently valued by Laura Martin from Needham at $1B. Imagine building a $1B television channel in a single year, because you fucking sell people a box. Astounding. What will they think of next?

Another fantastic sign is that they are just blowing out estimates every single quarter. It can't continue forever, but it's a very promising sign. And upgrades, and upward valuations on their assets like ROKU channel, it's clear that people underestimated this one and will continue to do so.

People who use ROKU products like the products. They are doing it right. They are successfully competing, and winning. Now is not the time to get worried, but to get greedy. Can AMZN and GOOG slide in some features on their product that nobody else has? Yes. Will it cause people to throw out their $199 TV and buy another different $199 stick? Probably not. 

**Moat**

Here, you have a product where there is not a huge amount of differentiation, but you have network effects. This creates a kind of winner-take-all effect. It's not nearly as extreme as something like FB, but it does exist. One network effect is that ROKU got on all the TVs before everybody else. The TVs get marketed by the manufacturers as ROKU TVs, and everybody hears about it. Another network effect is that ROKU now has a lot of consumer data-- probably the reason the ROKU channel is getting so popular so fast. The eventual goal is to build a bigger ecosystem that draws more and more people onto ROKU and creates a durable competitive advantage. That is a possibility, but I won't venture to say it will probably happen. The other thing is called ""cost of developers,"" as Ben Thompson calls it. The more scale, the lower the cost of developers. That is why MSFT was so successful. 

ROKU is also the Switzerland of this space. They will partner with everybody and that is conceivably a big advantage. Content providers would rather partner with it than AMZN or GOOG, who compete with them on content. 

**Valuation**

You can make a DCF to get any numbers you want, but we like to look for asymmetric upside. I think it's pretty clear where the asymmetric upside is coming from here-- a long string of years where they grow ARPU at 40% and/or users at 40%. The downside is that the growth decelerate from 96% platform growth to 80%, then 60%, then 40%, then 20% then 0%. This is very pessimistic based on historical advertising trends, and if that happens, we're still looking at $1.5B in platform revenue at the end of it. The kicker is that this revenue plays out for a while, because people take 8 years on average to replace their TV. So you are looking at an $800M annuity for 8 years(let's say 4 years, since it includes sticks + TVs), and you can see that even the worst case scenario is just not that bad. I think the likelihood of this happening, is low. Lots of downside protection here.

**Recent Quarter**

It's not any less expensive after that quarter. That quarter was a total blow-out. If you updated your DCF model, that intrinsic value got bumped up by 25%, at least. Don't fall for the fallacy that it's now more expensive.

**Competition from FAANG**

I like the notion that there is ""competition from FAANG"" because while it's never materialized in the numbers(ROKU is constantly blowing out estimates, not falling short), it makes people fearful. When theory conflicts with experience, virgins cling to theory, while Chads embrace experience. Be a Chad.",Jowemaha,1533940866,41,16,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/96blr6/roku_writeup/
BZUN - The Shopify of China,"Wanted to put BZUN on the radar, here's a couple highlights:

* Baozun is often called the “Shopify of China” since both companies provide marketing campaigns, digital storefronts, and fulfillment services to big and small partners.  

* The company partners with non-Chinese multinationals to enable them to effectively brand and sell their products in China. Baozun boasts, a total of 156 brand partners, including huge names like Phillips, Nike and Microsoft.  

* According to a study by consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company, 76 percent of China's urban population will be considered middle class by 2022, including 54% considered upper middle class. To put things in perspective, in 2000, just 4 percent of the urban population was considered middle class. ​  

* Internet penetration in China was 56% by the end of 2017. That compares to 88% in North America. By simply catching up over time, the Chinese population exposed to Baozun's online stores is about to grow more than 50% in the coming years.  

* E-Commerce in China grew 28% in 2017 and is now 15% of China's total retail market.  

* Baozun is backed by the top e-commerce company in China Alibaba (15.6%) and smart tech money Japan's SoftBank (11.8%) Not only is Baozun integrated into Alibaba's marketplaces, but it has also partnered with Alibaba's top rival, JD.com, as well as stores on Tencent's WeChat, the most popular messaging app in China.  

* The company is focused on the service side of the business, made up of “service fees” and “consignment.” The service-fee is reminiscent of Shopify in all its glory offering IT solutions, digital marketing, customer service, and inventory management.  

* Over the last 2 quarters its product revenue (gross based, related to its distribution model) has been mostly flat, while its service revenue (net based, related to consignment and service fee model) has been growing more than 55%.  

* Baozun's trailing P/E of 90 admittedly looks high relative to the industry average of 64 for online retailers. But its forward P/E of 41 looks reasonable, and indicates that the stock may actually be undervalued relative to its industry and earnings growth potential.  

* **Earnings next week.**  


TLDR: BZUN is great growth company, but be careful with FD's as the volatility is quiet high and it dropped significantly after earnings multiple times with healthy numbers. Looking at china's growth it's a great long term option. I've got some $50 CALLS I'm planning on executing no matter what direction we're going in next week after earnings.",WeAreUnited,1533929112,13,13,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/96a081/bzun_the_shopify_of_china/

Why that article on Yangtze Memory going to Market is BS (DD inside),"Ok autists, let me clear this up why you don't need to panic about your MU shares and why you shouldn't re-mortgage the house a third time to buy MU puts. 

So, according to an article by The Nikkei Asian Review, [see here](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/China-to-mass-produce-3D-chips-next-year-challenging-Samsung), China's $24B investment into Yangtze Memory startup has now developed a NAND chip (Xtacking) that, according to this article, will (1) be coming to market and rivaling Samsung by eoy , (2) be a ""game changer"" in performance, and (3) claims that Yangtze is coming into the market during an ""industry glut"". That last point though, let me quote the whole paragraph: 

&gt; Yet, Yangtze Memory is entering the market **during a time of glut**. The NAND flash memory market has been **oversupplied** since the beginning of the year and prices that have already contracted by 20% to 30% from last year are expected to fall through 2019.  

Wait a minute, wait a minute. First off, the semiconductor market (DRAM, NAND, NOR) is NOT in a glut this year. And it is NOT undersupplied. It is in fact UNDERSUPPLIED and everyone is reporting [record earnings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-25/sk-hynix-profit-tops-estimates-bolstered-by-memory-chip-demand). This should be the first clue to let you know whoever wrote this article is from /r/personalfinance. 

Second of all, from Yangtze Memory's own fucking keynote at Flash Memory Summit Aug 7th (when they debuted Xtacking), they claim their 64Layer NAND chip is nearly as dense at the competitors 96Layer chips, that IO speeds are nearly twice as fast, and that production time is reduced by 3 months. 

And then, at the end, they said they will NOT be ramping up volume on this magic NAND chip. Why? Because they said "" [from cost perspective it is not competitive](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13186/flash-memory-summit-2018-yangtze-memory-technology-keynote-live-blog-unleashing-3d-nand)"" enough to sell. So they're not even producing it yet, and the Xtacking chip was built in their current, smaller fab they said. The new, main fab being built will be used for ""future products"". So calm your tits.

Spotify Doomed to fail (Due Diligence​ inside),"Spotify is going to tank at least 67% in 1-3 years. My Due Diligence.

**Disclosure: I am trying to get a margin account to get approximately $5000 in long puts but the process of getting a margin account is taking a while.**

*“The streaming services have a bad situation, there’s no margins, they’re not making any money,” he said. “Amazon sells Prime; Apple sells telephones and iPads; Spotify, they’re going to have to figure out a way to get that audience to buy something else.”*

*-Jimmy Iovine (head of apple music &amp; former prolific music industry exec)*

**I want to warn investors that Spotify stock will fall and I suggest everyone short spotify (long put or short stock).** 

Current short interest: Approx 1.32%

Competitors Streaming: Spotify (Premium and free tier), Apple Music (Premium), Youtube Music (Premium and free tier), Soundcloud (Premium and free tier), Tidal (Premium and free tier), Pandora (Premium and free tier), Amazon music (Premium), Prime music (free w/ Prime), Deezer (Premium and fee tier).

Buying Music: Itunes, CDs

**Facts to understand before Due Diligence:**

“2/3rds of all music sales comes for three companies”

Labels: Universal, Warner, Sony

In the Itunes era Steve jobs forced the pricing of singles at $1. In the music streaming era, Labels/Artists and Publishers/Songwriters/Composers get paid fees when music is streamed called: Performance and Mechanical. Most of the rates are determined by Pseudo-government back entities except for the performance fee for the labels/artist, which is negotiated (still not even a penny). The economics is that Music Suppliers( artist/labels/publishers/songwriters/composers) all complain that they make absolutely no money, ie Taylor swift meltdown b/c of spotify, Tidal being created.

Streaming Services have two tiers free and premium. Free tiers make absolutely no money for Music suppliers. Another thing about the music industry is that music streaming companies negotiate their own payouts with labels/artist. To give an idea on the payout rate Tidal&gt;Apple&gt;Spotify&gt;Youtube. Youtube pays a paltry amount and the argument is if music is banned on Youtube people will post unofficial songs anyway then no money will made and Youtube will not be sued because (I can’t find the exact phrasing online) Youtube is a new innovative medium and is therefore protected in both European countries and the US from liability. Therefore Youtube has very low payouts becauses ads amount to very little revenue. Spotify has 75 million Premium members and 95 million members in its free tiers. The free tier dilutes the amount of money Music suppliers get. Apple music has 50 million users including free two month trials and has no free tier, which means it pays the most out besides Tidal.

“90% of its revenues from premium service subscriptions and 10% of its revenue from advertising via the company's free, limited-access service.”-Merrill Lynch on Spotify

**Due Diligence**

The facts are very important to understand before making an investment decision. The music industry is beginning to grow again but revenue in the US is at approximately 16 billion compared to 24 billion in 1999 (not including live performances). What does this mean? The internet has almost decimated the profitability of the music industry. Artist are unhappy and so are record labels with how much they get paid to the point that new legislation is constantly being introduced through lobbyist to reform the music industry. 

**Porter Five Forces**

**Supplier Power**

Labels/artists are suppliers who are forced to accept lower amounts of money for their music because of the internet BUT will still be insanely tough negotiators for their music. Not having control of your suppliers is bad for profits. Since streaming services can’t create music/ successful artist, they will essentially never have control over their suppliers.

**Competition**

Next the industry has has numerous competitors and is looked at as a value added service for larger companies ie google, amazon, apple. Therefore a lot of competition makes negotiating power with music suppliers very bad especially if there is an industry leader, Apple, which does not have a free tier which means they pay more per stream. This means labels have a strong negotiating power when dealing with Apple’s competition. Spotify’s size is replaceable in the long term and therefore their negotiating power based on their size is severely mitigated.

**Substitute Product**

A substitute product for streaming is illegally downloading music or just listening to youtube. Therefore, raising prices of the streaming services from $9.99 is impossible b/c dont want consumers to leave platforms. Also, Steve Jobs is notorious in the music industry because he was able to negotiate $1 per song on the guise that it was a way for the music industry to recover from napster. However, when given the option consumers no longer bought albums with undesirable songs, which caused a rapid decline for the music industry. Therefore, Apple will probably not budge for a while with raising its 9.99 price anyway because Apple is focused on the happiness of its consumers on iphones and macs not labels/artists or making money on streaming. 

**Buyer Power**

The nail in the coffin for Spotify is that all music streaming platforms have the same content. Because exclusive music content is negative for PR, Apple has moved away from it. Spotify could never really afford exclusive content from the get go. Therefore, all music streaming platforms have the same content and the only way they can really differentiate themselves is through music curation, which is very trivial for most consumers and I suspect all services will have a huge curation focus eventually.

Furthermore, switching costs from platforms are very low and there is only monthly subscriptions.

**Fin**

When spotify’s multi year deals current streaming rates with labels end, they will be drained of all profits they believed they were eventually going to make after negotiating. Spotify’s only real value is that they have 200 million people who use their platform. There business will however never run a profit. I would value Spotify’s eventual subscriber of paying and non paying users (est up to 280 mill) at 3-10 billion dollars (valuation includes 10% of Tencent Music ownership). Therefore my best case scenario estimate is that spotify is **320%** overvalued. Therefore, I recommend long term puts and shorting before earnings. If you have any long position on Spotify you have been **warned**. This industry is worse than the airline industry.

**For more info**: Here is an excellent article that has a wrong opinion but has great facts to better understand the numbers of the spotify and the streaming industry.

Selling $TSLA $420C = free money?,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/tesla-likely-to-face-sec-investigation-following-musk-tweets.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/tesla-likely-to-face-sec-investigation-following-musk-tweets.html)

I'll keep this short (no pun intended):

Facts:

1.) Elon Musk is under SEC investigation for his tweet

2.) $TSLA IV is expanding because of all this news

There are 2 possible outcomes of this SEC investigation:

a.) Funding is actually secured. No reason for investors to buy the stock past $420 because if the deal goes through they may lose money.

b.) Funding was not secured. Stock will guarantee to go down, because it was hyped on speculation of going private. Stock will not reach $420.

Both possibilities lead to the same outcome: Whether Elon has secured funding or not the stock will not go past $420 (at least in the short term).

Either sell naked $420 calls or $420/$420+ call credit spreads until the SEC is done doing their shit.",SentrySappingMySpy,1533771083,0,11,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95r917/selling_tsla_420c_free_money/

So you listened to me and bought $SNAP puts before earnings...,"This stock is dropping past hell.Earth's fucking core.At least, it should. That's what you wanted to hear. But the market will be irrational far longer than I am ever able to be solvent. I took some time yesterday to shit on snap about 4-5 hours before earnings dropped. And basically the stock ended the after hours session basically flat, with a (negative) You and revenue beat (of a respectable $11 mil) as the only buffers between SNAP and the very depths of hell.But I listened to the call, and aside from the ""victory"" of not losing as much money as the market thought SNAP was supposed to lose, things look bleak for SNAP. Real fucking bleak.The call was a collection of avoidance and attempts to gloss things with a baseless optimism. They basically refused to speak on DAU, and have discontinued its use as a metric that they give guidance on. If you dive into their presentation from the call, DAU dropped by 3 million down to 188. Snap tried to spin that in YOY terms, but social media isn't seasonal, you're trying to make little snap addicts, and even though snaps kept hyping how for a company this young having so many users is a big deal it's a much bigger deal that the users are dropping so early in their life.But what about revenue? Well most of SNAPs rev comes from ad rev. And most of that exposure to the ads is driven by a little button on the bottom right of the screen, the ""Discover Section"". An analyst who likely actually has used the app before had the good sense to ask how many people waste their time on that side of the app. (It's utter trash, I never use it, but maybe I'm just an old fag) Snap wouldn't say. They also wouldn't talk about clickthrough rates or ad engagement metrics. If I'm a company trying to sell an advertising platform (which at its core is their primary business model) why TF would I not brag up and down about ad engagement metrics and use them as a part of presentations on business performance and objectives for future growth?? Only reason not to bring them up is because the metrics fucking succ and would deter further advertising.And since privacy is important for users: the Indian guy on the call kept talking about all the different types of consumers they can identify, so it's very important to be able to trust snap won't have massive data leaks. they claimed that user should trust them for privacy, in light of the fact that they can’t even keep their own damn source code private. How can you trust a company that can't keep its own damn secret sauce a secret?And to go to a completely different area, news hit yesterday that some fucking Prince bought a lot of snap. So what? But even if it did mater, the accumulation was completed in May.And then finally, the big point that matters most, this trash company is still not cash flow positive. Back in 2012 when Facebook IPOed, Facebook had already turned a profit before, and grand total since IPO Facebook has had only 2 quarters with negative EPS, its first two. (-0.08 And -0.02). SNAP HAS BEEN NEGATIVE EVERY QUARTER SINCE IPO AND THEIR GUIDANCE FOR NEXT QUARTER DOESNT SHOW A FUCKING PROFIT EITHER.I am not the only person with a bullshit marketing and finance degree. Go listen to the call. That is a sinking ship. If you aren't short, get short.If you already are short, #metoo. Way to take initiative. If you're holding faggie D's RIP. While I want this to fall today or tomorrow, very likely that it just trades sideways on the earnings ""beat"" (hard to call a non profitable company with no signs of future profit a winner). I wouldn't be surprised if we see max pain on Friday at close, then start the selloff next week. Personally I am holding my Puts for at minimum a week. And I'll likely re evaluate the environment later next week once the earnings players have vacated the trading floor. If it hits $14 I'm not selling, unless it holds at 14 for a couple days and a support level gets found. If it goes sub 13 I'm holding on for more glory unless theta starts to fuck my profits.
TLDR: I listened to the call, it was bad, if snap doesn’t drop today it should start to drop next week.",DownvoteToKarmaHell,1533731784,211,118,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95lm5e/so_you_listened_to_me_and_bought_snap_puts_before/

ACBFF SELL OFF + DD INSIDE,"Noticed the almost 9% selloff in ACBFF today and only news I'm seeing is their planned acquisition of Hothouse. Wondering if anyone has some more info on this.

For the most part I think the weed stock ship sailed in january but I'm surprised to see ACBFF break below $5. Their investor presentation is claiming over 500,000 kg will be produced each year once all facilities are fully operational. We're talking 4 big ass grows over 100k kg a year, 3 in Canada one in Denmark. That translates to over 500 million grams a year. Currently their average sell cost per gram is right at about $8 with expenses at roughly $3 a gram. These are excellent margins and at $5 profit per gram times 500 million grams thats 2.5 billion dollars a year. The market cap is 4.6 billion. Other advantages I see them having are large market share, considerable inroads in Europe, reduced per gram expenses as operations scale up, and improved margins on concentrates and other products that MedReleaf excels in producing.

Possible disadvantages would be over saturation, lower than expected demand, and competitive pricing. I think another big factor will be their ability to infiltrate the U.S. market. I could go more into some of these but this post is already too good for WSB. Anyway let me know what you all think and why it sold off so much today.

Actual Snap DD inside,"Simple investment strategy: invest in companies you believe in and that you and others percieve well. Snap has been a peice of shit since the layouts were updated. I’ve been waiting to short this shit to the ground, and since facebook crashed (another peice of shit app that no milenials use anymore but I was cautious about shorting because elderly and adults still think it’s “trendy”) I’ve had my eye on Snap. Over the past year I have heavily decreased my snapchat usage, and this summer I barely used it at all. People are posting stories on instagram now because the snap layout makes viewing stories complete aids. No joke, last weekend I was at a wedding and my sister who used to use Snap for everything posted stories to fucking Instagram. In conclusion snap is a hot peice of trash and I finally bought puts. Who cares that they beat earnings, their daily users are declining. I may not have the research tools of big investors, but I have one thing they sure as hell don’t: my damn youth, which allows me to actually tell which social media sites are good.
TLDR: I’m short Snap cause I no longer use it and have a bad perception of the platform.

Serious: Elon wants the short sellers in agony because he has the emotional iq of a child/sociopath/saint; and knows that when TSLA reaches $420 is when the whales will be forced to cover.

ATH 390 to hypothetical 420 would be an %8 increase and many smarter people than us will most likely close their positions to limit losses, especially if it keeps moving parabolic. The upside is potentially over a $1000 if TSLA remains public.

You already know snap is a company that is bleeding cash. You know Snap doesn’t know how to monetize itself without pissing off its users. And you know that Instagram is starting to beat snap at its own game.

Take all this into account and then remember Facebook, a profitable company dropped more than 30 fucking percent after an earnings call that had them basically hitting estimated EPS.

Twitter (another profitable company) dropped about 20% after matching earnings expectations.

SO WHY THE FUCK WOULD SNAP GO UP EVEN IF IT BEATS EARNINGS? (Which I doubt it will) Social media companies are bleeding right now, and snap will not outperform behemoths like twitter and Facebook. The two have whipped up enough storm clouds that a slight snap beat would still plummet the stock to a much more reasonable valuation.

And if you doubt me, Ask yourself is SNAP really worth just $2 billion less than AMD?

DD on Nintendo- A History Lesson.,"Hey guys, 

So as you most likely know, Nintendo stock is down roughly 20% from its price in March. Its actual all time high was back in 2007 (70,500 yen, equivalent to $633.37), and its down over 45% from that point. 

I wanted to discuss whether Nintendo would be a good company to invest in, from a historical perspective. I hope someone finds my thoughts to be insightful. This is a big wall of text, so the TL;DR is that I am bearish from a historical and valuation perspective. 

Part 1- A Company Without Direction

Nintendo as a company was left in a very painful situation after the weak sales of the GameCube. It's attempts to directly compete directly with Sony and Microsoft were fruitless, as the more mature gamer base seemed to simply favor the IP's of its respective competitors. There were of course other factors involved (such as Nintendo's reliance on inconvenient storage media for both the N64 and the GameCube in an attempt to thwart piracy), but regardless of the reason, Nintendo was left shaken and vulnerable in the one industry it knew.

Left with few options besides switching to a third party developer, Nintendo instead decided to re-invent itself. Rather than compete with Microsoft and Sony, it would tailor more heavily towards the untapped casual gamers market by producing fun, innovative new consoles that prioritized creating new experiences over impressing on a graphical front. 

This led to them creating the Wii, Nintendo's most successful console of all time. It's stock soared to its all time high of 70,500 yen (or, roughly $633 in USD un-adjusted for inflation), back in November of 2007. 

However, Nintendo soon discovered a huge drawback to the casual gamer market it just won over- it didn't buy new games at the rate that more hardcore gamers did. While the install base on the PS3 or the Xbox 360 was smaller than the Wii, this install base was still much more active. This issue was aggravated by the fact that the Wii's weak graphical hardware limited the availability of 3rd party games on their platform, which heavily limited the number of available ""hardcore"" games on the platform vs its peers. This meant Nintendo had very little hardcore appeal at all. 

Nintendo's explosive initial success (its stock was up 439% from its IPO in 2005 to its peak in 2007), slowly tapered off as console sales slowed and game sales left investors unimpressed. 

However, the real guillotine came down on Nintendo with the launch of the Wii U. It was the worst selling major console release in Nintendo's history, even failing to eclipse the GameCube. Nintendo's future was suddenly in doubt once again, and the stock slowly bled out nearly 90% from its 2007 high to 2012. Nintendo had to come face to face with the other major drawback to its new strategy- ""trend surfing"" can blow up in your face if those trends phase out too quickly. The rise of tablets never really reached the terminal velocity Nintendo was looking for, and they, like their shareholders, were left holding the bag. 

Part 2- The Great Bottleneck

Nintendo has always had its monopoly on handheld game consoles to fall back on, the GameBoy, DS, and 3DS all dominated their respective generations with very little noteworthy competition. However, the sales and margins of the handheld gaming business simply does not compare with that of the home console market. 

Desperate and out of options, Nintendo came up with the radical idea of merging its handheld and home consoles into a single new console- the Nintendo Switch, a console that would allow them to sell home console priced games to its reliable handheld base. 

Nintendo took a big risk with intentionally cannibalizing its reliable handheld market in this way, but the risk seemed to have paid off with the incredible sales of the Nintendo Switch. 

However, this action carries a price- it alienates the 3DS and effectively puts all their eggs into 1 basket. If the Switch tapers off as the Wii did, Nintendo will have nothing to fall back on and they will be forced to downgrade to a 3rd party developer. Nintendo made the wise decision to ""front load"" its Switch launch cycle with heavy hitters such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and then followed it up with the excellent ""Super Mario Odyssey"" close to holiday season 2017. 

This gave the Switch a huge initial sales boost, but they are now paying the price- they have left their consumer base in a desert for the past year. Because of this, Switch sales have slowed down and the hype has finally come to an end. This reflects the decline of the Nintendo Wii in a way, and losing this hype factor is a very dangerous problem Nintendo will have to try and re-vitalize with Smash Bros and, next year, hopefully something else. Its struggled to get 3rd party support just like the Gamecube, Wii, and Wii U, and its own inability to produce sufficient amounts of 1st party content have resulted in it setting itself up with no safety net if every single one of their 1st party games isn't a hit. 

At this rate, it appears the downward spiral may repeat itself once again, and Nintendo will have its back up against the wall even worse than it did in the Wii U era. 

Part 3- Valuation. 

Mario, Zelda, Pokemon. These are all household names at this point, and they represent Nintendo's most powerful asset- its IP's. To help simplify the valuation argument, I think its best to compare Nintendo with another company I view in a similar light- Disney. 

Disney and Nintendo have a lot in common- they are both old stalwarts of their respective industries. Their age is ultimately what has allowed them to have the breadth and depth of the IP's they've accrued over the years, but its also the source of their greatest weakness- they've fallen behind in the rise of the digital economy. 

Disney, for all the companies it owns, still lacks a streaming service on the scale of Netflix. It has essentially taken over the US box office, but its cable companies, particularly ESPN, have really been dragging it down. This is reflected in the share price, which, while on an absolute tear lately, still sits at a modest 18 P/E ratio. 

Conversely, Nintendo has struggled with the advent of the digital games economy and the continued growth of the smart phone games markets. Worse yet, the aforementioned smart phone games market directly cuts into the casual gamers consumer block, Nintendo's biggest target audience. 

And yet, Nintendo's stock has a P/E of nearly 30. 

Disney and Nintendo both share many of the same pros and cons as well as nearly identical dividend yields, yet Nintendo enjoys a significantly higher valuation than Disney. Without a good understanding of why this discrepancy exists, I would have to assume Disney is the better stock to pick up for an entertainment play. 

Because of the high valuation of Nintendo's stock, the bad historical cycle it demonstrated back from the Wii-Wii U era, and the lack of real direction for the company moving forward besides down-scaling to 3rd party once they inevitably get hit with another under-performing console (maybe not the Switch, but perhaps its successor), they won't really have anywhere else to go. 

Let me know what you guys think about Nintendo as a company and as a stock. Thanks for reading. ",Trump_The_Lion,1533605879,114,48,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/957bmr/dd_on_nintendo_a_history_lesson/

Buy lotto strangle for SNAP earnings DD inside,"SNAP will make a huge move during earnings! When it went down during prior earnings, it went down by ~20% on average. But when it went up during earnings, it went up by 50%. 

Reasons to buy call:

- Snap has already dropped so much since their sh**ty update a few months ago, followed by Rihanna’s tweet, FB/Twtr apocalypse that one should ask themselves: can it go any lower? 
- Just because snap is doomed in the long term does not mean it is doomed in the short term. 

Reasons to buy put:
- I used snapchat religiously, and so did all my friends.   I used to get atleast 200 views for my stories. I recently put up a story and only got 40 views. None of my 400 snap friends post stories anymore. Everyone I know who used snapchat has migrated to instagram stories 
- My sister who just graduated high school believes that snapchat died after their terrible update. None of her friends use snapchat (except for taking pictures to share on instagram stories). 
- Social media companies have been getting owned in recent earnings. 

Given all these arguments for both sides, why not just invest in lotto strangles that are wayyy otm? We know its going to make a huge move, we just don’t know the direction. I know the IV is ridiculous, but it has not even reached its max yet, and possibility of a 20%+ move is hard to ignore.

Seeing a lot of people say that HEAR puts on earnings is gonna be the sure move. “Fortnite has peaked” has been one of the things thrown around a lot. I do hate the game, but battle royals is more than just Fortnite. So let’s hold up for a minute. It’s only been about half a year or so, maybe a bit more, since the battle royale format really became popular. I see battle royales coming to dominate the console industry. Hell, both Battlefield and COD developers have announced battle royale-style modes in their upcoming games. This thing has a lot of room to grow, particularly considering the dedicated fanbases of those long-established names. HEAR will improve guidance going into the end of the year as the holiday surge on consoles and video games in general will boat revenue dramatically.

This bastard has beaten earnings every quarter since their mid-2015 IPO, except for their last report which only met estimates. The stock dropped about 5% afterwards, but had experienced a 23% 3-month run up and was up 100% YTD, so it probably just needed to cool off.

Coca Cola European Partners - $CCE,"So I saw a thread on here the other day about the hot weather possibly driving sales of Coca Cola higher this quarter, and decided to do some solid DD for you fags.

Europe is currently going through one of the hottest heatwaves on record. (Reaching close to 116 F in dusty ass places like Greece).

So people will be drinking every ice cold drink they can get their hands on.

The average European temperature for each Quarter is as follows:

$KO has already released their earnings report last week, and reported a revenue of $8.9B. 4.2% more than the $8.54B estimate.

Despite slowing sales in North America, growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased and drove the share price up by 2.3% within the first three hours of trading.

Now Coca Cola’s European bottling company $CCE is due to release earnings on Thursday. European sales have increased  (As mentioned in $KO ER last week), judging by past performance, the hot temperatures will increase sales by about +3%, and volatility for the company remains low at around 22%.

I'm taking the gay route and going long on $DIS so I won't be playing the earnings. I do think it's going to be interesting - I think we're going to see great numbers, ESPN will be less of a shit bag than usual, and it's going to be a great presentation with great guidance.

Keep your eye on $AAOI in after hours today. YUGE earnings play potential.,"tl;dr if you see AAOI spike bigly in after hours go ahead and throw your entire net worth into those stonks.  

\&amp;nbsp;  

Here's what you need to know. AAOI is based in the US and labeled a semi conductor company. But really, they're more into fiber optics and data centers, and the only thing they actually do in the US worth a shit is R&amp;D. The long and short of it is, AAOI has great long term outlook, but they are getting mollywhopped in the short term currently(like many semis due to Yuan issues and trade war talks). This is worsened by the fact that they never say anything besides on the day of earnings. Many if not all of their clients are bound up in NDA's. In addition to this, some of the projects have huge business cycle lengths that don't allow profits to be seen for a while. However, in last quarters earnings it was stated that there were a number of big players who had contracted with AAOI, and that investors would start to see the gains from that and from previous partners. This is really important for guidance and you will see why later. 

\&amp;nsbp;  

What is really important is the data center aspect. Revenue growth from that has been extreme in china and taiwan over the last couple of years. This contrasts with a majority of CAT5 projects they used to do which have very long business cycles, the data center projects they have are way faster in the time to completion which in turn leads to more profits in the short term. Also, a proxy company that handles almost everything for AAOI outside of the US just recently filed with the SEC that they were taking on a loan from a Taiwanese bank. My guess is they will be using that to finance projects there because AAOI doesn't really have a huge debt/equity ratio currently. Plus it would be good to see on QE report that production was ongoing in Taiwan and china regardless of trade talks.  

\&amp;nbsp;  

Here's the play. AAOI for reasons unknown has a fucking massive short interest ratio, 61.49% last reported. I tried to look into it as some sort of convertible bond play, but that only accounted for like a 1.5 to 3% short interest ratio. I'm guessing it has just been labeled as a consensus short. In addition to this, 70% of AAOI is industry owned, which leads me to believe this a little more. As we talked about earlier, AAOI has great long term growth outlook, so at some point all of these shorts will have to cover because AAOI should be getting better valuations through 2018-19(especially Q42018 Q12019) that will drive the stock price higher. But for all we know this earnings could very well be the catalyst for a short squeeze of Enron Musk proportions.  

\&amp;nbsp;  

But if their earnings goes to shit the short sentiment will be regarded as true and the stock will tank. That is why I don't recommend doing anything until you see what happens after hours. Also the premiums on these options are ridiculous so a poor fag like myself will probably just stick to the stocks so I can still profit if a short squeeze happens. Here's hoping to The Big Squeeze ya filthy animals.  Also to all the other poor fags that use RH you have no excuse not to check this since RH allows free after hours trading now.

Reasons to buy SNAP puts,"I've been seeing  a lot of posts advising everyone to buy puts for SNAP. While the majority of the time going against the wisdom of r/wsb is highly profitable I think this one is a rare exception. SNAP is terrible company and the past 3 months have left a trail of evidence pointing short sellers to the obvious.   

Below is their last earnings report highlights   

Operational Highlights   

• \*\*Daily Active Users (DAU)(1) grew from 166 million in Q1 2017 to 191 million in Q1 2018, an increase of 15% year-over-year. DAUs increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, from 187 million in Q4 2017.\*\*  

 • Revenue was $230.7 million in Q1 2018, up 54% year-over-year driven by growth in Snap Ads, and down 19% sequentially, primarily due to seasonality and our redesign.   

• Average revenue per user (ARPU)(2) was $1.21 in Q1 2018, up 34% year-over-year and down 21% sequentially. \*\*Cost of revenue per user (CoRPU)(3) was $1.03 in Q1 2018, up 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.\*\*  

 • Adjusted EBITDA loss was $(217.9) million in Q1 2018, an increase of 16% year-over-year and 37% sequentially.  

 • Cash and marketable securities were $1.8 billion at March 31, 2018. Cash management reduced cash burn by 13% sequentially, to $222 million.\*\* Capital expenditures increased to $36.3 million in Q1 2018 compared to $18.0 million in Q1 2017 and $21.2 million in Q4 2017\*\*.    

Lets keep this simple..  

The key figure is DAU. With the huge app redesign that took place and the public backlash that followed, there is little to no chance DAU increased significantly especially considering that Instagram stories have begun to compete heavily with SNAP along with Facebook stories. The app offers no competitive advantage. Failed additional revenue streams including Snapcash, clothing, and glasses all point to a dark future. On top of that they have additional expenses incoming from their move to Santa Monica which is almost guaranteed to increase capital expenditures. SNAP is a novelty app trading at 20x sales. 

\*\*Risks\*\*   

I think its fair to think that SNAP has very low expectations to investors and analysts and a beat in any number of categories will potentiality see some investors thinking positive short term.     

Surprise product announcements?     

The app redesign increased  Average revenue per user (ARPU) and decreased Cost of revenue per user (CoRPU)   ",itbeg,1533304005,60,60,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/949prf/reasons_to_buy_snap_puts/

Why you probably shouldn't buy chinese meme stocks. DD inside,"There won't be any financial DD here, just an analysis of China's social policies.  


China is undoubtedly the fastest growing economy in the world. More urbanization is happening in that country right now than ever before in human history. With a population of 1 billion and yet still 500 million living in relative poverty, the country has ridiculous potential.  


That being said, **you probably shouldn't buy Chinese stocks**, because the country is a real-life 1984 dystopian hellhole in the making. The country still has many institutional problems and I would not be surprised if it loses massive amounts of people once its population is wealthy enough to migrate.  


Most of the world is familiar with china's internet policies. To support their anti-criticism, anti-activism framework, all search results and public profiles are constantly scoured by the government as to not include unwanted information. You cannot access Facebook or Google in China. Something like wallstreetbets, with the slightest potential to criticize a government's policies, would be banned outright. As massive and inclusive the internet is poised to be over the next few decades, with China [threatening to expand](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/technology/china-technology-censorship-borders-expansion.html) its censorship beyond Chinese platforms, this is ripe for global information manipulation.  


That's not the end of the story. China began its ""[social credit system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System)"" in 2014, with plans to fully implement by 2020. Right now, all Chinese citizens are given ratings by this credit system. The government positions this policy as a tool to prevent scams and counterfeit goods in the market, however anything from jaywalking to being from a poor family can be used as a reason to lower your score. A low score acts like a low credit score, but with the added benefit of potentially keeping you locked in the country and having your name advertised in a ""blacklist"" of bad people that others should avoid. China suggested in 2016 that employers begin using this blacklist as well to not hire people with low social credit. Millions of Chinese citizens already display and judge scores on social media and dating apps.  


You might be asking, ""how the hell would they give me lower credit for jaywalking""? Seriously, **ANY** [everyday behavior could be monitored by the government](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinas-social-credit-system-keeps-a-critical-eye-on-everyday-behavior-even-jaywalking-2018-04-24/) at any time. They are so concerned with subversive surveillance that they are [using realistic bird drones as in public areas to monitor citizens](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2152027/china-takes-surveillance-new-heights-flock-robotic-doves-do-they). If this doesn't scare the shit out of you, I don't know what else would.  


China is not using its newfound economic success to help provide its people with prosperity. It has doubled down on its authoritative policies and plans to use its economic success as a marketing tool to undermine any attempts to criticize its horrific social policies.  


I love tendies as much as you do. I took the time to write all this up and I'm still long $18k into BABA (because its underpriced for its potential). That being said, I am incredibly skeptical of the country's long term future. ",blowtestmebaby,1533225557,31,24,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/940ios/why_you_probably_shouldnt_buy_chinese_meme_stocks/

$PETS update,"\*Updated below post\*

Cat food and pet medicine stock. Thanks to a massive oversupply of liberal arts degrees,  careerism trends, and feminist propaganda, 1-800-PetMeds ($PETS) has  seen booming growth in sales over the past year. In North America, young  adults are 8 times as likely to own a pet than a child, and pets are  now twice as likely to be vaccinated as children.

The  $30.6 billion U.S. pet food market is expected to grow 5.4% a year over  the next five years, but more importantly, the proliferation of  internet pornography continues to drive down marriage rates, and by  implication, drive up pet ($PETS) ownership rates, especially among  women.

$PETS uses an online model similar  to Amazon to disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and uses an  omni-channel approach to support rapid growth. Revenues are growing 13%  yoy and growth continues to be supported by unusually high prices on  prescription products.

The rising  standards of living for humans will trickle down to pets, and humans  will continue to spend more on pet health compared to how much we spend  on our own health. Long $PETS

XPO EARNINGS,"is anyone playing xpo earnings? 

Stock is trading at $96.00 after dropping over 10% from it's ATH about a month ago. Freight market has been tight and most 3pls are making bigger margins and beating earnings. 

Their last mile delivery division probably dod well on ecommerce boom, while truckload, brokerage, and LtL all benefited from the tighter market.

They charge the customer a fixed price, while the price of trucks drops, increasing margins. ",wwick2010,1533040830,7,11,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/93e4fk/xpo_earnings/

Reminder if MSFT is selling off from the failure of others buy the dip,"Once again I’m watching my MSFT position get attacked from things outside of its control. Trade tweets whether its steel, dairy, or automobiles MSFT stock gets slapped. Netflix, and Facebook disappoint MSFT gets slapped. Mike Wilson continues talking about rolling bear market MSFT gets a slapping. Tech gets downgraded and people consider the FANG stocks to be susceptible to correction MSFT gets slapped.

MSFT has the doubt of not being the talk of the town when it comes to even the tech sector. Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Facebook, even twitter no one cares about talking about MSFT as much as either of FAANG or twitter. What separates MSFT from others is its actually a cash king and since Steve Ballmers departure MSFT has been positioning for growth and it actually has not only the cash flow, but the acquisitions and gaining market share to back up its price. Xbox continues to bring in smelly wrinkled dollars in the hundreds of millions (up +30% in gaming revenue). Minecraft sold 53,000 copies per day during the course of 2016. Linkendin continues to solidify its position in the business world. Azure continues to provide growth as CIOs agree its more cost efficient for workloads to be done in the public cloud than on site. Walmart has been advocating for its partners to consider Azure and has recently backed up its talk. 

We have github and flipgrid for the most recent acquisitions.  Defense contracts with the Government such as with ICE for facial recognition. Back in May this year the Intelligence committee awarded Microsoft an agreement for their cloud services further solidifying the trust in MSFT services.

Looking at the big picture for FB,"Since people haven't really been posting charts...let's look at FB. It was obviously overbought. Looking at the MACD, we are still fine. As for the consolidation range, we just went back into our box of $160-195. Anything above that box was a breakout, and FB just had a failed breakout. It's just not ready yet. So we may see some more downside risk in the near future but honestly after this drop this is a good time to buy long term. 

Anyway, Facebook is a buy. I'll be looking to pick up more shares at or near 165-170.

The wrestlemania of tech earnings ends next week... so where do we go from here? $MU,"Listen, I like you guys &amp; I know alot of you fello autists have failed with MU by buying at ATH near earnings and getting buttfucked. 
--------------------------------------------------------

If you are one of these guys who plays FDs on earnings and hate MU because of the mouthfucking it provided you...what you need to know is that, what you are doing with $MU is all wrong because earnings is a massive sell off... And in all honesty its the dumbest thing for it to drop, we all agree on this... AMD barely gets its shit together and its already close to hitting $20... MU has millions for buy back, knows revenue/EPS out the park. Sets a great tone for guidance. its such a perfect stock in so many ways. And its not cyclical like alot of bitch ass analyists have said in the past(maybe true a few years ago)... Why do I think they are wrong now? Because there is a computer boom occurring right now as we get closer to living in a world similar to blade runner. In all different fronts and not just personal computers is this stock booming. 

Places like cloud data centers (you know that thing that pushes Amazon and Microsoft to the stratosphere each quarter), AI, IoT technologies, phones, you name it, if it has storage, it has MU and friends.

--------------------------------------------------------

So how do you play MU? RUN UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't believe me? Look at the last two earning's, month before ER, run up... BOTH times this hoe as gone up from ~$50 to $60 (Last one was $64!). It doesn't have negative shit out (aside from china possibly which I will speak more on). ITs already going up, I am done with the wrestle-mania of tech and switching over to MU.Good luck to apple and the rest that still got a go but I need more assurance and space than just a week before ER.

So CHINAAAAAAA. Yes, its playing retarded right now and trying to steal MU's patients to copy. And Trump is about to throw in 500 billion dollar tariffs on this country. Both should make you uncomfortable. But now unlike 2 weeks ago, US is not alone on this. EU this week said that they will work with the US and try to get China to play honest. If china is smart, they would try to fold like the commies in EU did. Or else they are about to get hit with tariffs they cant directly counter attack... China dont even have 500 billion tariffs to counter. How they plan to retaliate is still to open to debate (target US companies in china, tackle American debt they are owed, etc). But with pressure coming from all the major countries in the world... It will be interesting to see what happens.

I am actually closing all positions as an options only trader since these past few weeks is the moeny maker for me. Don't need to buy/hold much and risk another correction(We had a nutty tech run where we hit ATHs)... But I will buy/hold for MU which is $10 away from ATH.


--------------------------------------------------------

WIth all this said... we may get a rocky journey to MU's ER but its more bullish than bearish. BUT since you autism isn't fully charged to utter stupidity. I hope you only buy a Sept 21 Calls at $57.5(or $55 if your a pussy) for 1/3 of the amount you want to invest and add more with each dip.

Earnings is on Sept 19.

Make sure to SELL before earnings! Buy an FD with your gains with a portion if you think it will do an AMD but dont risk everything on the earnings. Play the game of no IV &amp; have no risk of the unheard dare I say... possible shitty MU earnings.

$SNAP DD and earnings outlook,"Snapchat: currently trading at $12.92 \[52-wk high of $21.22, 52-wk low of 10.50\]  
 

With Facebook and Twitter both taking sizable hits following their ERs, it’s time to take a look at Snapchat. 

$SNAP is the least viable of the three companies. Its gimmick — videos and pictures you send to people “disappear” after a few seconds — struck a chord with millennials and became the de facto platform for sending nudes. It’s taken off since IPO’ing back in May, 2017 at $24 a share. Since then Snapchat is most notable for every social media site creating some kind of “stories” section— a curated timeline of pictures and videos for people that subscribe to you.   
 

Why puts:  
 Back in February, Snapchat unveiled its controversial update that changed the layout of the app…they’ve since “fixed” it…..the problem is, I don’t think they have. The layout is a compromise between the old and new — if you want to know what people think of it, check out \[Snapchat on the App Store\] (r/https://imgur.com/a/1ePfUgK).   
 

Even though Facebook missed earnings, one of the reasons to be bullish on $FB longterm is Instagram. Its analogous to Twitter in that “everyone” is on the platform—except instead of “everyone” including Donald Trump’s drunken but somehow sober thoughts at 2AM—“everyone” is Kylie Jenner’s duck-face selfies. What does this have to do with Snapchat? Remember earlier when I mentioned that Snapchat is responsible for all these “stories” ? Let’s get back to that.  
 

Snapchat launched their “stories” feature back in 2013. Zuckerberg caught wind of this in 2016 and boom, Instagram has stories now…and they’re called stories…not even trying to hide it. The absolute madman. And, like MU dropping another 2 perce—sorry I meant to say *clockwork*, WhatsApp has stories, Medium, Messenger, Facebook, Skype, YouTube, they’ve all got stories now.   
 

That’s the biggest problem for $SNAP. If its most or second most distinguishable feature has been copied outright by its biggest competition (and everyone else) what’s stopping people from just using the other platforms. And that’s what has been happening. Within just a few years, Instagram stories and WhatsApp stories (both $FB, just in case you’re still unaware) registered almost DOUBLE the active users that $SNAP stories did.  
 

$SNAP \[missed earnings\] ([https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/01/snap-q1-2018-earnings-and-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/01/snap-q1-2018-earnings-and-revenue.html)) the last two times it's reported. It dropped after Twitter reported its own earnings miss.   
 

It is certainly possible that Snapchat doesn’t miss earnings this quarter, but the outlook is not good for growth, which, as we saw with $FB and $TWTR, is key.  
 

The argument for calls: the growth outlook may suck but it might not impact *this earnings* as much as the next year of earnings. The expectations are low after two misses, it wouldn’t take much to trade flat or go up. It’s also been beaten down after Facebook and Twitter misses.

Anecdotally:  
I used to use Snapchat, I don’t anymore. Some of my friends still use it. Most people I know use Instagram more.  
 

TLDR: Snapchat has missed last two earnings, Facebook continually steals their lunch money but $SNAP can’t do anything about it, kids don’t like the recent changes to the app, and Facebook and Twitter just cratered after earnings.

I’m an idiot. .by taking this as advice you acknowledge youR an idiot and any losses are ur dumbass fault for listening to my dumbass, dumbass

Big D's DD for 7/27 (Calls and Puts ideas),"Okay \*cracks fingers\*

$AMD: My anticipation for $AMD is one of two things, either the public has finally caught onto the true value of AMD and it goes all the way over the next week, or it was a pump n' dump and it crashes like 10% in one day next week (possibly even today). Judging by its history and current technicals, I feel it may go up for a few more days (made most of my money in the past swing trading AMD)

$SNE: Sony has one of the best quarters its every had, and has had nonstop positive results. It has earnings next Tuesday and I believe its going to go up, I feel like everyone should buy in today or get calls as it will grow pre-earnings on Monday, and may skyrocket tomorrow.

$APPL: Huge risk as we saw with NTFX and FB, if APPL has a slightly lower income (which I feel it will as Samsung is eating the phone market), it may be worthy of a put or short straddle!

With earnings coming up, this seems like a great buying opportunity. I currently have 8/17 $19 calls, and I think it could hit between $20-$22 by then. Right now in AH its up 1% to 19.78. Earnings is coming up, and I think this is an opportunity to rake in the tendies.

Note under the TME investment section:

""Tencent Music Entertainment Group (“TME”), through its parent, Tencent Holdings Limited, has announced its intention to list TME's shares on a recognized stock exchange in the United States through a registered public offering. We own TME shares. These are held in long term investments on our balance sheet. A TME IPO would trigger a fair market value adjustment to the carrying value of our investment recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain could be significant. The accounting treatment for such a gain could trigger a tax benefit large enough to generate positive Net Income for us in the quarter of the IPO. If such an outcome were to occur, it would be a one-time, non-recurring event. The following quarters we would expect the business to once again generate a Net Loss.""

JD is worth $89/share. Analysis inside,"**The Bull Case for JD.com (JD)**

JD.com, Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates as an e-commerce company and retail infrastructure service provider in the People's Republic of China. It operates in two segments, JD Mall and New Businesses. The company offers home appliances; mobile handsets and other digital products; desktop, laptop, and other computers, as well as printers and other office equipment; furniture and household goods; apparel; cosmetics, personal care items, and pet products; women's shoes, bags, jewelry, and luxury goods; men's shoes, sports gears, and fitness equipment; automobiles and accessories; mother and childcare products, toys, and instruments; and food, beverage, and fresh produce. It also provides gifts, flowers, and plants; nutritional supplements; books, e-books, music, movie, and other media products; and virtual goods, such as online travel agency, attraction tickets, and prepaid phone and game cards, as well as consumer electronic products. In addition, the company offers an online marketplace for third-party sellers to sell products to customers; and transaction processing and billing, value-added fulfillment, and other services. Further, it provides online marketing services for suppliers, merchants, and other partners; logistics services for various industries; consumer financing services to individual customers; and supply chain financing services to suppliers and merchants. Additionally, the company offers online-to-offline solutions for customers and offline retailers, as well as online and in-person payment options and customer services. JD.com, Inc. offers its products through its Website jd.com and mobile apps, as well as directly to customers. December, 2017, JD.com operated 7 fulfillment centers and 486 warehouses in 78 cities covering various counties and districts. The company has strategic cooperation agreement with Tencent Holdings Limited and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. JD.com, Inc. is headquartered in Beijing, China. Most recently, Google announced they took a $500mm stake in JD last month. They plan to collaborate on a range of strategic initiatives, including joint development of retail solutions in a range of regions around the world, including Southeast Asia, the U.S. and Europe. By applying JD’s supply chain and logistics expertise and Google’s technology strengths, the two companies aim to explore the creation of next-generation retail infrastructure solutions, with the goal of offering helpful, personalized and frictionless shopping experiences.

**Analyzing the Momentum:**

After the announcement of Google’s stake in JD surfaced, the stock skyrocketed to the $50 range. Unfortunately, it didn’t hold. But, that’s exactly why I find JD so attractive. The stock is $14 cheaper, and nothing has changed since then.

[https://imgur.com/a/UOsP9cy](https://imgur.com/a/UOsP9cy)

I went ahead and looked at the SMAs for 20 days, 75 days, and 200 days. The shares are all under the moving average ranges, which would normally be an extremely bearish sign, but I don’t believe that’s the case this time around. Bear with me for a minute here:

The VWAP over 100 days is at $38.12. This means that on looking at shares traded on a volume-adjusted basis, shares are currently trading below the range most people entered. Additionally, RSI is drastically oversold as it’s near 37. I would consider both of these to be a strong sign, especially in tandem with two solid green candlesticks on relatively strong volume recently. I will go more in depth about the fundamentals in the next section, but I strongly recommend buying JD as there is some major upside.

**Financials:**

It’s no joke to say that JD is an expensive stock as it is trading near 200x PE. However, JD’s sole issue is profitability.

The company is currently valued at $53bn and they have $55bn in sales. To put this into perspective, Amazon is valued at $905bn with $177bn in sales. This is roughly 5.11x sales, whereas JD is 0.96x sales. Expected revenue for FY18 is $74.16bn while their EPS is $0.68, which is up 250% YoY. EPS is predicted to grow to over $1.20 next year as well on revenues just shy of $95bn. My point is that JD is still in growth mode, and they have the perfect setup to do it.

For example, I don’t think it would be unreasonable to say that JD could be trading at 2.17x trailing sales, which is a very fair estimate. **That would value the company at $89.48/share.**",itschrisolson,1532619224,20,15,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/923a0f/jd_is_worth_89share_analysis_inside/

It's never too early to start thinking about recouping losses,"My condolences to all, truly.

One money-making position I have is in IHI (iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF). These companies manufacture all the equipment we use in the hospital. The nice thing is regardless of if a patient can pay if we crack open an Edwards Lifesciences transducer set or some idiot tech drops a Stryker catheter on the floor the companies still get their check. It's the hospital that eats the cost when insurance doesn't reimburse (short US health systems BTW). Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci isn't cheap either but it attracts the newer surgeons we need on staff who are the techy type so it's a necessary expense (a $2M+ expense at that...why do you think your bill is so expensive?).

It doesn't really trade options but you can gamble with the individual components: MDT, ISRG, SYK, BAX, and EW are all solid suppliers. Everything from beds to IV pumps to $8,000+ vascular catheters are all necessary supplies. The population is getting older, fatter, and sicker so purchases are stable / increasing.

"Donut Tendies incoming (DD inside, no pun intended)","Hello fellow WSB cucklords, 

I'm a Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robbins franchisee in a top 10 sized US city. With company stock having been on quite a nice run in the last few months and the brand announcing Q2 earnings tomorrow morning,  I thought I'd share some info with you guys on why DNKN stock  might be a good buy going forward. 

First thing I should point out is why Dunkin posted such a massive beat in Q1. In Q1 of this year, the brand went through a massive menu changed for the purposes of simplification and reduction of the number of SKU's, and streamlining of the supply chain of inventory. This might be surprising, but Dunkin stores and especially Dunkin/Baskin combo stores carry more SKU's than any other restaurant chain in the QSR industry. We got rid of a massive 33% of all SKU's that we were carrying during this menu simplification. There was a lot of fear in the franchisee community around this time as all the changes were all implemented on a national basis, so for example, Dunkins nationwide discontinued the Biscuit when stores in the south outsell stores in the north by a ratio of 10-1 in biscuits and biscuit related products. However, the brand was firm about not carrying regional SKU's and unilaterally made the menu changes across the country. Analyst's estimates of Dunkin Q1 earnings reflected the sentiments of the franchisees-- that customers would take a while to adapt to the menu changes and this teething period would be reflected in the earnings. However, this proved to be not the case, and most stores amazingly found that the changes only effected guest satisfaction and behavior for about 3 weeks. Hence the brand posted a nice beat for Q1. 

There are a few reasons the stock has had a nice run up lately and the outlook for the rest of the year and beyond is truly exciting. Dave Hoffman from McDonalds came on board as COO late last year, and his primary innovation was the implementation of the 2-3-5 value menu, something that Dunkin has never had in the past. Guests were able to get 2 bacon egg and cheese croissants for 5 bucks, sandwiches which have been priced at 4-5 bucks and never discounted. Again many franchisees resisted, but it proved to be a smashing success. The stores in my market ON AVERAGE experienced Dunkin only sales comps growth by 13% over last year. We have been moving towards the direction of a more upscale coffee house with a lot of technology and design innovations in the process of happening. Some of these include: 

1) On the go mobile ordering so you never have to wait in line. 

2) Replacing standard espresso machines with high quality barista style brewers. 

3) Incredible new next generation design store which reflects our new modern style, many of which many units are up and running, see here: [https://imgur.com/a/P3JO6Fj](https://imgur.com/a/P3JO6Fj)

4) Innovative new coffee products and delivery systems, see in the picture above there is a full bar line/tap system, where you will be able to have nitrogen infused cold brew coffee which looks like a delicious dark beer [https://imgur.com/a/CTjce28](https://imgur.com/a/CTjce28) . 

5) Many new national partnerships especially with sports teams with various attached promotions. 

6) Testing stores where 'Donuts' is removed from the name, making it a nice clean 'Dunkin'

All in all, the phenomenal success of the value menu with these exciting new developments augurs for a great future for Dunkin and our business. I should add that the Baskin Robbins business has definitely struggled recently as consumer's dessert habits have changed, but the brand isn't building standalone baskin's now and there's very little downside to having a Combo store as Dunkin does 80% of its business before 12pm so it doesn't hurt to augment it with another brand. However, even Baskin is making effort to restore the brand to a more healthy place, including trying to launch viral style products like everything but the kitchen sink ultra giant milkshakes called Freakshakes that I imagine is every WSBers go to food to drown out the pain of being burned by the hope of elusive MU tendies.

Shopify is worth $257.13. Analysis Inside,"Shopify provides a cloud-based commerce platform designed for small and medium-sized businesses. Merchants use its software to run their business across all of their sales channels, including web, tablet and mobile storefronts, social media storefronts, and brick-and-mortar and pop-up shops. The company provides a platform for merchants to create an omni-channel experience that helps showcase the merchant’s brand and grow its business. The company’s platform provides merchants with a single view of their business and customers across all of their sales channels and enables them to manage products and inventory, process orders and payments, build customer relationships and leverage analytics and reporting. In summary, Shopify is a hub for online stores to get started and begin to leverage their businesses. Shopify has partnerships with Amazon and eBay to merchants direct paths to sell via these platforms.

Apart from Shopify’s own payment system, payment solutions such as Apple Pay are available on the platform. I will touch on the numbers later, which are phenomenal by the way, but Shopify makes money from two sources: Subscription revenue and Merchant revenue.

Subscription revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual term. The terms range from monthly, annual or multi-year subscription terms. The company earns revenue based on the services it delivers either directly to merchants or indirectly through resellers.

Shopify generates the majority of merchant solutions revenue from fees that it charges merchants on their customer orders processed through Shopify Payments. The company also derives merchant solutions revenue relating to Shopify Shipping, other transaction services and referral fees, as well as from the sale of Point-of-Sale (POS) hardware. At the end of 2017, the company had more than 609,000 merchants with over 1,000,000 active users.

**Financial Health:**

On May 1st, 2018, Shopify reported a non-GAAP profit of $0.04 per share, which was up from last year’s ($0.04). Their revenue increased 69% YoY to $214.3mm, and as their merchant base grows, Shopify’s top line will continue to expand.

Subscription revenue grew 61.4% YoY to $100.2mm, which was supported by GMV (gross merchandise volume) of $8.0bn. Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital both grew more than 50% YoY.

The most impressive thing about Shopify’s most recent quarter was the record profit of $124.3mm, which soared 71.4% YoY. This non-GAAP gross margin grew by 110bps mainly due to revenue growth in partner referral fee.

[https://imgur.com/a/I1F4INP](https://imgur.com/a/I1F4INP) 

With a view to make the platform more merchant friendly, Shopify is working on extending language capabilities beyond English. We believe this inclusive move will boost engagement and consequently increase adoption going forward. Further, shopping on Instagram was expanded to 35 countries in April.

Shopify has been developing various apps, including various augmented reality (“AR”) based applications to streamline customer experience, The first-of-its kind merchant product on the Shopify platform has been built on Shopify Mobile Buy SDK and Apple 's ARKit, enabling users to check how the goods look in real life surroundings. Moreover, investments in latest technological developments such as Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality will reap benefits for the company going forward.

**Understanding Shopify’s Platform:**

It’s no joke to say that Shopify is expensive as its PE ratio TTM is over 700. I am usually weary of anything over 35. But, I believe there bull case here is strong as Shopify has been posting growth that we’ve haven’t seen since Amazon’s early days.

Shopify charges merchants monthly fees to use their platform. These fees range from $29/month al the way to $299/month. Additionally, Shopify receives a flat rate of $0.30+2.9% per transaction, but it can be as low as 0.5% if using an external payment gateway.

Long story short, as Shopify gains transaction around the world, their revenues will scale very nicely, and I can see Shopify posting over $1bn in revenue by next fiscal year.

T**he Buying Opportunity:**

· Shopify continues to add to its platform, which is the main reason it grows at the rate it does. The launch of Shopify Payment, Shipping, and Capital have made it drastically easier for merchants to expand their businesses. Notably, the number of users for Shopify Payment grew each quarter in FY17.

· Shopify added a massive 231,500 new merchants in 2017. This number is projected to grow as Shopify scales with Google Pay, Apple Pay, Facebook Messenger, and Amazon. Shopify also added support for Houzz, Wanelo, eBates, and other channels. Shopify’s App Stre has more than 2,300 apps, and they expect this number to grow continuously. Shopify also has a referral system, which should boost the merchant base and drive top-line growth this year.

· Shopify is constantly adding new partners. They added almost 4,000 new partners last year, and their agency program drove Shopify Plus subscriptions higher than ever before. In addition to this, the Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) per merchant grew to 62% to $30mm at the end of FY17, which is mainly due to strong growth in Shopify Plus. Shopify will now be offering Shopify Plus with variable pricing, which is a great decision.

· Shopify is focusing on the mobile markets, which is a great way to leverage their growth. Shopify Mobile reached 75% of users, and accounted for 64% of sales, which is up 69% and 59% YoY respectively. Shopify has stated that merchants’ shops averaged 218 million unique monthly visitors, most of which were from mobile devices in 2017. Per market research firm comScore, during 2017 holiday season (Nov-Dec), mobile commerce grew 44% from the year-ago period, with $17.1 billion spent through smartphones and tablets. Per eMarketer, M-commerce sales are projected to grow 32.7% in 2018.

Bumble accuses them of suing them just to drive down their share price so they can acquire them later. Who knows. The origin of both companies is both shady and fkced up and I won't get into it here.  It's a tale of heartbreak, internet love and casual sex that turned into real feels but that's a story for another day.  Anyhoo MTCH just acquired Hinge which is Bumble's younger, innocent naaive sister aka An App that allows women to upload full profiles and is targeted towards middle to higher income women who want meaningful shit.  MTCH continues to sit on a boatload of cash for future acquisitions and has so far dodged anti trust regulation because the market cap on the industry is relatively small but eventually they won't be able to buy anymore but by then it'll be too late and they'll own everything (sorta like MSFT in the early days before anyone even knew what Enterprise software even meant).

Gold was a runaway success with users continuing to pay more for extra features. ARPU is up bigly and will continue to climb as the app adda more features (such as the ability to make full profiles and women get to control who messages first etc).  

Tinder has hinted to the point of blue balling about a new feature which should add significant revenue. They strongly indicated on the last conference call that this feature would be announced at the end of Q2.  

Lastly, Tinder continues to push in emerging markets such as India and South Korea.  Pairs in South Korea is growing and continues to bring in good numbers. Domestically the amount of new subscribers should be higher as MTCH has invested in advertising this quarter at a level they have not done in previous quarters (aka college campus appearances with celebs like Adam Levine, traditional ads etc).

"Real JD DD, kinda","I saw a post a few days ago talking about JD and how it just touched it's historic support level of $35. I figured why not and decided to look into it on my own.

[Here is the Imgur of my technical analysis stuff. Real detailed.](https://imgur.com/a/UYP57Qt)

If you can't tell by now, this is going to be a low effort post written at a second grade English reading/writing proficiency level. Anyway, in the picture I noted the previous times JD touched its $35 support and the the levels of the three main indicators I use, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and MACD. Right now, JD's RSI is low, way too low, indicating it is well oversold. This alone should be enough to warrant thinking about going long, but going even further, let's take a look at the Bollinger Bands and MACD levels. Recently, JD dropped out of its typically Bollinger Bands range. For those of you who are illiterate and don't know basic shit, this means it will likely ""snap"" up back to its normal levels soon-ish. This, coupled with the fact that the MACD lines are converging towards an upward crossover indicates, to me at least, a run up to earnings very soon.

"[DD] If the current fears over cyclicality die off, semiconductor stocks are poised to take off and a look at valuations","I'm a long time Micron bull, I'll admit my bias right up front (though I've sold off some of my shares and spread my money out a bit more). I don't need to rail on and on about how underpriced Micron is. That's a conversation we've had a hundred times here, and even though it is true (at least from a fundamental standpoint), it doesn't matter if people aren't buying the stock. 

Right now with Micron, and all other semis, the biggest concern is an expected drop in demand, which leads to a drop in prices, and of course a drop in revenue.

Going into 2016, there was concern that semiconductors may start to slow down, as executive confidence [reached lowest levels](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2016/02/kpmg-global-semiconductor-outlook.pdf) in years.

&gt; ""In this year’s survey, a significant decrease in KPMG’s Semiconductor Industry Confidence Index reflects a shift to uncertainty and negative
&gt; sentiment among industry leaders. After three years of cautious optimism, respondents believe 2016 offers only flat to modest growth.""

Gartner said that [semi revenue will decline](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3476417) in 2016 as well.

&gt; Worldwide semiconductor revenue is forecast to total $332 billion in 2016, a decrease of 0.9 percent from 2015, according to Gartner, Inc. 

Instead, [revenue grew](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3573717) by 1.5%

For 2017, Gartner [forecasted revenues](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3815063) of $411B, for a 19.7% increase. What happened? Well revenues [ended up growing](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3842666) by 22.2%, to $419.7B.

For 2018, Gartner [forecasted 7.5%](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3845163) revenue growth, to $451B. In April, they [bumped up that forecast](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3870478/semiconductor-forecast-database-worldwide-q) to $470 and 11.8% growth.

Obviously, the semiconductor sector is on fire. Forecasts for 2018 are more of the same, though maybe not as on fire as 2017

[KPMG](https://advisory.kpmg.us/blog/2018/adv-semiconductor-industry-outlook-for-2018.html)

&gt; Semiconductor leaders expect 2018 to be another year of growth for industry revenues though the industry will be hard pressed to match the historic growth rate of 2017...Average Sales Price (ASP) erosion is still seen as the top industry issue for the next three years but by a slimmer margin than last year. Keeping pace with diverse customer demands jumped to number two this year.

[WSTS](https://www.wsts.org/76/Recent-News-Release)

&gt; WSTS expects the world semiconductor market to grow in 2018 and 2019 to US$ 463 billion and US$ 484 billion respectively. For 2018, this represents growth of 12.4 percent. This reflects expected growth in all major categories, with an extraordinary growth from Memory at 26.5 percent followed by Analog ICs with 9.5 percent. In 2018, all geographical regions are expected to grow.

[IC Insights](http://www.sourcetoday.com/supply-chain/semiconductor-industry-forecast-continues-brighten)

&gt; The semiconductor industry’s forecast is brighter than originally thought. That was the conclusion of market research firm IC Insights on Wednesday, when it almost doubled the growth forecast for the semiconductor industry from eight to 15 percent in 2018...IC Insights now expects DRAM prices to increase 36 percent – significant given that the memory technology’s price jumped 81 percent last year. The price for NAND is forecast to increase 10 percent after jumping by 45 percent in 2017. The actual number of DRAM and NAND chips sold will grow only 1% and 6% respectively.

Two weeks ago, the Semiconductor Industry Association released that global sales [were up in May](https://www.semiconductors.org/news/2018/07/02/global_sales_report_2017/global_semiconductor_sales_in_may_increase_21_percent_year_to_year/) by 21% year-over-year

&gt; “The global semiconductor market has posted consistent growth of greater than 20 percent for 14 consecutive months, and May 2018 marked the industry’s highest-ever monthly sales,” said John Neuffer, president and CEO, Semiconductor Industry Association. “The Americas led the way once again, with sales increasing by more than 30 percent compared to last year, and sales were up across all major semiconductor product categories on both a year-to-year and month-to-month basis.”

https://i.imgur.com/wktWPFz.png

Everyone agrees that semiconductor sales have been strong the past few years and are strong now. That's the biggest issue. Will ASPs maintain and/or grow? Will margins increase/decrease?

Hilltop Economics looks at how final demand (in the broad economic sense)[ could forecast](https://linxconferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Meldrum-Outlook-SPCC-4-11-18-Handout-1.pdf) semi growth:

https://i.imgur.com/MmA2tG5.png

Semi.org [could see FAB spending](http://www.semi.org/en/2019-prognostication) (that is, the construction of new plants) growing again in 2018, for a near-unprecedented three consecutive years.

https://i.imgur.com/fbH9og0.png

That could also further lead to a truly unprecedented four-straight years of FAB growth.

&gt; Little wonder, then, that the record pace of investments through 2017 stoked speculation that traditional industry cycles could be changing. Historically, spending sees one- to two-years of growth followed by a downturn of roughly equal duration, setting up 2019 for a fab spending slowdown if historical norms play out.   
&gt; 
&gt; However, now, one year later, SEMI’s World Fab Forecast data point to an improbable eye-watering fourth consecutive year of fab equipment spending growth to the tune of 5 percent

FAB spending and semi revenues usually move hand-in-had (chart is my own; 2018 uses estimated FAB spending and revenue). FAB spending and semi revenues carry an r2 value of .778, very strong.

https://i.imgur.com/H4qWLWV.png

An increase in FAB spending would point to further increase in semi revenues. 

Intel is [poised to spend $5B](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12774/intel-discloses-plans-to-spend-5-billion-on-israeli-fab-28) in FAB spending in Israel.

Micron [will open a new facility](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12622/micron-starts-construction-of-third-nand-fab) in Singapore (where they have two other facilities) sometime next year.

China is expected to continue to push towards local expansion in semis.

Semi.org expects [a 5% growth in FAB spending](http://www.simmtester.com/page/news/shownews.asp?num=19985) overall in 2019



Inkwood Research [sees the semiconductor market growing](https://www.inkwoodresearch.com/reports/semiconductor-market/) at a 7.67% CAGR through 2024, ending in $835B in market by then

&gt; The global semiconductor market was valued at $463.5 billion in 2016 and is projected to reach $831.5 billion by 2024, growing at an estimated CAGR of 7.67%, for the forecast period of 2017-2024. Increasing investments in research and development, growing demand for consumer electronics, and evolving IOT market are all contributing to the market growth.

In 2016, with a $463B market value and $339B in sales, that's a 73% rate. If we expand that forward at the same rate:

Year | Market | Sales
---|---|---
2016	| $464B |$338B
2017	| $499B | $364B
2018	| $537B | $391B
2019	| $577B | $421B
2020	| $621B | $453B
2021	| $669B | $488B
2022	| $719B | $525B 
2023	| $774B | $565B 
2024	| $832B | $607B

Obviously the market is discounting that growth by a fair bit, with concerns of cyclicality and a drop off in prices. The semiconductor cycle is boom and then bust. We've clearly had some boom, but have we had it all?

Going into 2018, a KPMG survey found the semi cycle to be mostly expansionary still

https://i.imgur.com/ZYbHmwh.png

&gt; Are we entering a “new wave” semiconductor industry?  The significant majority of executives (62%) think we are in an expansion stage of the industry cycle in 2018, and more respondents than last year think we are in an early expansion stage, perhaps of a multi-year expansion. This finding reinforces the view that the industry is still in a strong upcycle and may reflect the fact that semiconductor leaders are taking a future-oriented approach and considering new end markets beyond the PC, such as AI, IoT, and autonomous vehicles. In addition, despite its historic year, memory companies likely do not see any coming reduction in sales in the sectors they are feeding, given booming demand for smartphones, data centers, and autonomous vehicle technologies.

Concerns of seasonality/cyclicality have started to really grow. After a huge runup in SOXX (semiconductor ETF) over the past few years, it's up 5% this year so far with long peaks and troughs, running up strong when the market is running good (December/January) and getting hit hard in overall pullbacks (February). 

Perhaps the make-or-break, or at least a strong indicator of the future, will be this upcoming earnings season. Q2 is a weird quarter for semis, as BofA Merrill Lynch describes:

&gt; We recommend some caution/wait-and-see during Q2 earnings season on: 1) potentially
&gt; conservative outlooks given global trade tensions; and 2) seasonally muted quarter for
&gt; semiconductor stock returns (SOX averages 190bp in Q3 vs. 800bp+ each in Q4 &amp; Q1).
&gt; Q3 tends to be the quarter when auto/industrial trends peak, and when consumer builds
&gt; (PCs, gaming, phones) are just starting to ramp, so visibility can get a bit strained and
&gt; companies can often guide conservatively. 

But they still have a positive outlook on the sector

&gt; To be sure, we think the results will be fine, it’s the stock reactions that we are concerned about on a near-term basis. We still firmly believe in the longer-term structural drivers for semis, and would view volatility as an enhanced opportunity for our Buy-rated stocks into Q4 &amp; 2019.

---

&gt; We expect US Semis to deliver strong 11%+ sales and 23%+ YoY earnings growth in Q2,
&gt; and guide to at least 10%+ YoY EPS growth for Q3.

Speaking of SOXX, it's currently trading at ~14.6x P/E ratio, below it's historical average of 16.3x (and the S&amp;P 500 at 17.5x) despite semis growing at a faster rate than most sectors. Right now SOX is at 1,359. To get to a P/E of 16.3x, that would put it at 1,517, or ~12% growth (or 20% growth to get the P/E in line with the S&amp;P 500).

Now Q3 for semis tends to be somewhat quieter, rising only ~2% during the quarter (still better than the S&amp;P 500 in the same time) but then taking off for ~8% in Q4 and into Q1 of the next year.

https://i.imgur.com/3Qoi4cK.png

**IF** Q2 turns out to be a strong quarter for semis, then that could break that trend easily and potentially put a stop to the fears that we are at a peak in the cycle. Those concerns would still carry over into 2019 a bit, but it should still put semis more in line with the overall market from a relative standpoint.

We know that Micron posted a strong earnings quarter when they reported back in June. Highlighted by:

6% increase in DRAM ASP (vs 4% expectation)

6% increase in NAND ASP (vs -5% expectation)

Increase in CAPEX/FAB spending

Most analysts are bearish on NAND prices, but expect DRAM prices and bit growth to continue to increase overall for the time being.

Many of the times, these semi companies are being valued at a lower multiple than big box retailers (Wal-Mart), banks (Bank of America), and credit card companies (Discover/Amex).

It seems clear that if you think that the market is discounting cyclicality too heavily for the semi industry, then the valuations for the sector are incredibly low. That's a bet you'll have to decide for yourself but I don't think the we are at the later stages of the growth cycle for semis, and if we are, there is still more room to run in this cycle. If that's correct, we're going to see a massive correction.

A little background- started the month off with 100k. I withdrew about 28k last month because I, like all of you, have some form of impulse control issues and thought that would keep it safe. All time high is around 300k and all time low is about 17k (not including when I first started with about 2k in 2010).

Also, I'm trying to convince my wife that I could totally do this instead of work. That's a whole different kind of yolo...

Anyway, I was not satisfied with the movement on MSFT so I held. Looking to offload next week.

Hoping AMD closes above $16.7 on Friday so I don't look like an idiot.

I'm not looking to play AMZN or GOOGL next week because I'm running out of pepto and have no clue how the market is going to react to things anymore.

Looking for an entry point in NVDA below $250 to hold shares for a run up and probably sell covered calls into earnings. Probably looking to buy 1k shares after I offload MSFT.

Debating whether or not I should throw some money in NOW. Leaning more heavily towards puts but don't follow my lead here. This is mostly driven by boredom, stupidity, and because a friend said, ""You should buy ServiceNow!"" Luckily, I didn't take his advice on NFLX.

I'm kind of nervous about next week. Thoughts?

Analysis of Microsoft. DD Inside,"**Azure (The Cloud):**

Before I touch on financials from their most recent quarter, which was reported yesterday, I want to look at the success of Microsoft’s Azure platform. While we don’t know the fiscal impact of it yet, Microsoft secured a 6-year deal with the US Intelligence Community for Windows 10, Azure Government, and Office 365 Government. I believe there is still potential growth potential for Microsoft in the US Federal Space.

1. Significant Federal adoption opportunity. 7 years after the first cloud policy was announced, cloud adoption among US federal agencies is picking up in pace. The US Fed cloud spending is expected to grow at 11% CAGR through 2021 to over $3.4bn. The Federal FY18 budget includes a focus on adopting new technology.

2. Six-year deal with intelligence communities. This deal allows 17 different federal agencies to use Azure Government cloud services and Windows 10. This builds upon Microsoft’s $1bn deal last year with the Air Force.

3. US Department of Defense Contract. The win potentially helps MSFT in its pitch for the US Department of Defense JEDI cloud contract, expected to be awarded by September 2018. The 10-year US Department contract could be worth as much as $10bn. Unlike the multi-cloud approach that has permeated across Enterprises globally, the DoD contract is expected to be a sole-source award with AWS reportedly seen as the front-runner.

During the conference call last night, Satya Nadella said that “Azure is the only hyper scale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application platform, security and management, and our differentiated architectural approach drove another strong quarter of growth.” Essentially, this means that Microsoft is taking this platform and translating it into impressive revenue growth that will allow margins to expand as the business is gaining scale.

Here's where things get interesting: in their Q4FY18 report yesterday, Microsoft reported that operating income grew faster than gross margins, which grew faster than revenues. This is due to successful cloud growth, which I believe is the future of Microsoft (as I’ve said about many companies previously).

**Analyzing the Earnings:**

Right off the bat, Microsoft delivered more than $110bn in revenue for FY18 which witnessed double digit growth on both the top and bottom line. Supporting this was the commercial cloud business which brought in more than $23bn with a gross margin of 57%.

The Intelligent Cloud brought in $9.6bn, which is up 23% YoY. This was supported by server product revenue growth of 26% and Azure revenue growth of 89%.

Though people have been claiming that PCs are dying, revenue increased 17% to $10.8bn, which was supported by an impressive 23% revenue increase in Windows commercial products, 25% Surface revenue growth, and 39% increase in gaming revenue.

Though Microsoft reported an absolutely monstrous quarter, it is not without problems.

**The Potential Risks:**

1. OEM Non-Pro revenue declined 3%, which is slightly below the improving PC market.

2. Declining Xbox Live users. Live had 59mm users in Q3 and that figure declined to 57mm in Q4. This is slightly less encouraging.

3. Though the financials are relatively strong, FCF decreased YoY. Nadella said this is due to “reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business.”

4. Microsoft acquired LinkedIn in order to market its professional audience, however, LinkedIn is still losing money. Granted, its margins are improving.

**What’s Microsoft Worth?**

Assuming Microsoft continues to grow at the rate they currently are, I believe Microsoft should be worth $115. Therefore, I believe its current valuation is actually very fair. In my opinion, its share price will depend on the discount rate applied to its WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital).

CRISPR Therapeutics DD (CRSP):,"**So, what is Cas9 Gene Editing?**

Well, would you believe me if I told you that if you truly wanted to, you could change anything about yourself? CRISPR may revolutionize how we tackle some of the world’s biggest problems, like cancer, food shortages, and organ transplant needs. Recent reports even examine its use as a highly efficient disease diagnostics tool. But, as with any new technology, it may also cause new unintended problems.

CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. Essentially, it is a series of short repeating DNA sequences with “spacers” sitting in between them.

In short, bacteria use these genetic sequences to “remember” each specific virus that attacks them. They do this by incorporating the virus’ DNA into their own bacterial genome. This viral DNA ends up as the spacers in the CRISPR sequence. This method then gives the bacteria protection or immunity when a specific virus tries to attack again.

Accompanying CRISPR are genes that are always located nearby, called Cas (CRISPR-associated) genes.

Once activated, these genes make special proteins known as enzymes that seem to have co-evolved with CRISPR. The significance of these Cas enzymes is their ability to act as “molecular scissors” that can cut into DNA.

After DNA is cut by CRISPR-Cas9, a new DNA sequence carrying a “fixed” version of a gene can nestle into the new space. Alternatively, the cut can altogether “knock out” of a particular unwanted gene — for example, a gene that causes diseases.

CRISPR technology is advancing so quickly that the Salk Institute has a Cas9 system that’s capable of targeting a gene without editing the genome at all. This is important because it could ease the concerns of the detriments of permanent gene editing.

**How Does Cas9 Actually Work?**

There are three parts involved in this process:

1. Guide RNA. This is a piece of ribonucleic acid that helps locate the gene. This is synthetically produced in a lab.
2. CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9): This is the “scissor” that cuts the undesired DNA.
3. DNA. Scientists then insert the new, modified DNA after the break is created.

In essence, the guide RNA finds the piece of DNA you want to edit and locates the exact part of the specific gene. Once it’s located, the Cas9 makes a double stranded break in the DNA, and the new DNA takes its place as the old DNA strand is removed.

**What’s the Potential with Crispr?**

The possibilities are endless.

Though still in Phase 1 and 2 trials, experiments on lab rats have been incredibly positive. In fact, one study shows that CRISPR has been able to disable a defective gene associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, inhibit the formation of deadly proteins in Huntington’s Disease.

Additionally, a 2015 study conducted by Chinese scientists performed a test on beagles that disables the myostatin gene. The myostatin gene directs normal muscle development. In the absence of the gene, the beagles displayed muscular hypertrophy and created dogs that were signifincanty more muscular than non-modified dogs.

**Human Trials:**

While there has been extensive research performed on animals, human trials have progressed much more slowly. Partially due to ethical reasons, but also due to some of the immense downsides, which I will touch on later.

Starting with cancer, the University of Pennsylvania is awaiting FDA final approval to test CRISPR on patients with multiple myeloma, melanoma, and sarcoma.

Europe is currently testing CRISPR technology to fight a beta-thalassemia blood disorder known as Sickle Cell.

Though patient trials are awaiting further FDA approval, a biologist by the name of Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health and Science University has begun editing a mutation in embryos that cause a thickening of the heart muscle. The altered embryos came back 72% mutation-free in the lab, which is 22% higher than the 50% chance without Cas9-editing.

**What’s the Future Like for CRISPR?**

1. Xenotransplantation. This is the act of transplanting animal cells into a human recipient. There is a high demand for organ transplants, and not enough organs to supply the demand. Xenotransplantation could be a possible solution.
2. Food and agriculture. Gene editing can make farming more efficient. It can curb food shortages, and it can create resilient crops that are impervious to droughts and other environmental impacts. For example, in 2016 the white button mushroom was edited to become resistant to becoming brown. In September 2017, a flax seed plant was edited to enhance omega-3 oil. In October 2017, Chinese scientists engineered a pig that had 24% less fat.",itschrisolson,1532013636,1,0,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/906rl8/crispr_therapeutics_dd_crsp/

Why CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has the potential to be a $250bn company. DD Inside,"**What is Crispr Therapeutics?**

The mission of Crispr is to develop a transformative gene-based medicine for patients with serious diseases. Their therapeutic approach is to cure diseases at the molecular level using the breakthrough gene editing technology called Crispr/Cas9. Its lead product candidate is CTX001, which targets sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia with an ex vivo approach whereby cells are harvested from a patient, treated with a CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutic and reintroduced into the patient. The company is also developing CTX101, a donor-derived gene-edited allogeneic CAR-T therapy targeting CD19-positive malignancies. In addition, it is developing earlier stage allogeneic CAR-T programs targeting B-Cell maturation antigen and CD70; hemoglobinopathies to treat other diseases, including Hurler Syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency disease; programs that are in preclinical development for indications, including glycogen storage disease Ia and hemophilia; and programs targeting diseases of organ systems outside the liver, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.

For example, in 2016 the white button mushroom was edited to become resistant to becoming brown. In September 2017, a flax seed plant was edited to enhance omega-3 oil. In October 2017, Chinese scientists engineered a pig that had 24% less fat. ",itschrisolson,1531929516,1,0,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8zwq9q/why_crispr_therapeutics_crsp_has_the_potential_to/
SLB Earnings 7/20. Get in today if you want to play it long. Mediocre DD inside.,"- SLB is down ~1% today and has traded basically flat for most of the last 6 months.  Today is a good entry point for an earnings play.

- Oil prices have gone way up in the last year, but SLB hasn't moved that much.  If prices stay high, SLB should catch up.  Many oil producers started hedging against downside risk at $55 WTI, but they never hedge 100% and their future hedges get cheaper when oil moves up.

- Recent supply chain disruptions in [Libya](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-oil-explainer/how-unstable-is-libyas-oil-production-idUSKBN1K61Y6) and [Venezuela](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Venezuelas-Oil-Meltdown-Defies-Belief.html) are providing tailwinds to oil prices.  Venezuela is seriously in full meltdown and Libya remains unstable.  Many other major oil producers are also seeing supply chain issues.

- Fundamentals are decent, but not great.  Could be some good upside in the next 6 months especially if oil stays high or goes higher.

"DD into Golden Leaf Holdings (GLH, GLDFF)","

I started studying GLH again a few months back while browsing Cannabis companies with operations in Canada and the US. Since then I’ve read every article, statement, quarterly report etc… from GLH i could find. I initially stayed away from the company when I started investing in cannabis because they had a sketchy management team who didn’t do any favours for shareholders, management has now changed. According to the new CEO William Simpson, the founder of Chalice Farms. The only thing left of the old management is the name (see interview linked below). From what I can gather when GLH bought out Chalice Farms last summer Simpson and his people lead a sort of corporate coup, booted the old management and took over. Simpson is now the CEO &amp; his Chalice farms co-founder is the COO (see investor presentation linked below for senior management bios)


This new team appears to have their heads on their shoulders. They have a great track record with Chalice Farms (an award winning dispensary chain with 7 locations in Oregon). My biggest concern with the industry is there is so much emphasis on cultivation that we could be risking an oversupply. On top of that there’s no distribution, it’s great to grow the stuff but you have to be able to deliver it to the end consumer in a profitable way. This will hurt margins at all the producers, big &amp; small. Strategically GLH is in a fantastic position to grow rapidly when US legalization occurs, they’re either licensed or acquiring licenses in most legal US states &amp; Canada. They are nearly cash flow positive and currently have over $22m USD cash on hand. Once they receive their extraction license they’ll become profitable imo. Canaccord Genuity released a report recently staying the company is undervalued.

The plan to sell Chalice farms franchises for $50k is a great way to grow distribution. The biggest value add products in the industry are oils, extracts &amp; edibles, by franchising distribution it’ll help provide some consistent cash flow as well  as a distribution channel for in-house high margin products where they’ll have a say in price, shelf-space etc.. I think Simpson’s focus on more value add products like edibles &amp; oils is brilliant because their margins won’t disappear in the event of over supply (Like in Oregon). Simpson said recently it’s cheaper for them to buy flower on the open market then to produce it due to oversupply. I read yesterday they already have edibles to market in over 50% of the dispensaries in Nevada.

Golden Leaf itself will be able to focus on improving their premium brand selection without having to worry about distribution.  They are already in markets like California, Canada, Nevada, Oregon. Once they roll out the franchise systems and the industry matures I believe they’ll be huge.High end recognized brands with quality products are the future of the mainstream cannabis industry IMO. The US cannabis boom will be 10x the size of Canada’s. They have the potential to be the Starbucks of cannabis imo.

Why BAC is worth $35. DD Inside.,"**Highlights from their ER:**

* Bank of America just reported earnings Monday morning, and their numbers were nothing short of exceptional.
* Bank of America posted $0.63 EPS, which beat estimates by 11% and grew an astonishing 43% YoY. Revenue grew by 3% to $22.6bn, which also beat analyst estimates of $22.27bn.
* Due to the new tax reform bill, Bank of America’s income tax dropped to $1.7bn from $3bn, which dropped 17%. As a result, the now 10.8% ROE and 1.17% return on assets are now a reality, though previously thought impossible just a few years ago. Most importantly, the efficiency ratio, which is just operating cost divided by net revenue, grew to 59%, which is the best among the big banks currently.
* The banking division had 7% loan growth and 5% deposit growth in tandem with noninterest expenses dropping 5%, which led to higher efficiency. Merrill Edge brokerage assets increased 20% YoY while client balances grew to a record $2.8trillion.

**Reasons for upside growth:**

1. The Federal Reserve is finally undergoing quantitative tightening, and this means Bank of America is looking forward to gradual improvement in the interest rate department. Net interest yield increased from 2.19% in 2015 to 2.38% in 2018. Net interest income is also improving as driven by higher rates and loan balances. Since 2015, Bank of America has seen 7% CAGR.

[Net Interest Income](https://imgur.com/a/awlJSUN)

2. Declining expenses continue to support the bank’s profitability. The company remains on track to achieve its operating expense target of $53bn this year and expects expenses to remain stable in 2019 and 2020.

3. Bank of America continues to align its banking center network to the customer’s needs by divesting and consolidating branches. By 2020, the company intends to open 500 new centers and redesign more than 1,500 centers with technological upgrades. This will allow them to expand their financial footprint with a primary aim to have full franchise, where until now, they provide commercial wealth management services.

4. Bank of America’s capital payment plans look impressive. After getting Fed approval during the CCAR two weeks ago, the bank got approved for a 25% dividend hike and $20.6bn in share buybacks.

[CCAR](https://imgur.com/a/FFjCWDD)

5. With revenues that are higher than competitors and a valuation that proportionately cheaper, BAC looks like a great company at a good price. BAC trades at 1.24x book. ",itschrisolson,1531842634,59,31,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8zma3t/why_bac_is_worth_35_dd_inside/

This is causing [nightmares for logistics and freight across the industry](http://fortune.com/2018/06/27/americas-trucker-shortage/).

CSX doesn't have drivers, so they will be able to capitalize on higher shipping rates by increasing margins.

2.  Some people drew some lines and stuff on a graph and it looks bullish.  I don't believe in technical analysis too much, but the trend is strong for this one and momentum is in it's favor.  

3.  The fundamentals are great too.  Earnings have been increasing but the P/E is still below 10. Analyst ratings are generally positive.  There's still long term potential no matter what happens tonight. That means if you want to play it safe you can buy shares or LEAPS and still make a profit even with an earnings miss.

Key points to take from Netflix's earnings,"Investors are beginning to worry that Netflix may have reached peaked growth, and with increased competition coming in the next couple years from AT&amp;T-Time Warner, Disney-Fox or Comcast-Fox, and Daddy Bezos, many of you fuckers are wondering if this bubble has popped. However, there are a few key takeaways from this earnings that may have contributed to this big pullback:

1) NFLX doesn't know what the fuck they are doing when it comes to guidance. They tend to overestimate or underestimate by 1 million subscribers. Netflix has a tough time coming up with proper guidance since they have something like 170 markets to monitor and correct guidance is near impossible. This has worked well in their favor having underestimated most quarters, but once every 4 or 5 quarters they miss guidance and the stock will take a massive shit.

2) NFLX content this quarter sucked balls. Like that fucking Will Smith movie? That shitty Lost in Space series? Like where the fuck was content this quarter? On top of that, their most popular shows did new seasons during Q2. We can likely assume that Q3 won't suck quite so much ass.

3) The World Cup likely cut into numbers (especially international numbers) more than Netflix expected. The truth is, this World Cup was lit as fuck. How can some shitty Will Smith MIB ripoff compare with the fucking World Cup, especially when soccer is practically a religion for half the global population.

4) Netflix still beat EPS estimates. This is extremely important since Netflix is borrowing enormous amounts of cash to produce contents during rising interest rates. Their entire business model fails if growth fails since they will be fucked by debt, but luckily they are becoming more profitable even in the midst of a weak quarter.

Personally, I think Netflix is overvalued, but there are plenty of legitimate reasons why this selloff may have been affected by outside factors and why a quarter like this may not remain a trend. If growth continues to wane for another quarter then Netflix starts to look very unattractive as competition heats up in 2019 and 2020. Till then, Netflix remains king.",blingblingmofo,1531840164,23,15,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8zlxd3/key_points_to_take_from_netflixs_earnings/

Apple's Services make it worth $230. DD Inside.,"I believe that as Apple is able to scale their service revenue segment, I believe they will be able to better scale their company. Currently, services account for 15&amp;#37; of total sales, but service revenue has increased 31&amp;#37; YoY and 8&amp;#37; QoQ. Contributing to this was the amount of paid Apple Music subscribers, which grew to 270mm, which is up 59&amp;#37; YoY.

**So, What’s the Deal with Services?**

I believe service revenue is a much bigger deal than people are making it out to be, and here is why: it is a highly profitable segment that is easy to scale, and it comes back and contributes directly to the top and bottom line.

1. Apple has some revolutionary offerings when it comes to Apple Pay, Apple Watch, Apple Music, and Apple TV. Revenues from services and licensing are on track to double to nearly $48bn by 2020. Apple recently hired former Sony executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to get their feet wet in original television programming.

2. Apple Pay has been expanded to over 22 different markets. Apple Pay users doubled, while transactions more than tripled YoY. Apple recently launched Apple Pay Cash, and is planning to expand into Norway, Poland, and the Ukraine in the next several months.

3. There has been a ton of buzz around AI recently with AR/VR, and Apple has started to focus on development of these technologies. According to an IDC report, global spending on AR/VR will witness a CAGR of 98.8&amp;#37; from 2017-2021.

4. In their most recent quarter, Apple’s operating expenses increased 16&amp;#37; to $7.53bn while their operating margin declined to 26&amp;#37;. While this is due to expanding R&amp;D costs for Apple Car, Apple TV, and other expenses, a focus on software and services will not cost as much to develop as hardware, which means more profitability.

The most important thing about service revenue is how it’ll affect Apple’s stock price. Apple is currently trading at around 16.6 TTM earnings. If Apple trades just above this metric at 19x earnings, Apple is worth $199. If Apple trades at 25x earnings, Apple is worth $230 per share. That’s great on paper, but is it possible? Yes. The industry average for companies with service revenue is 33x earnings. That would put apple at $303/share.

Softbank Will Be The Millennial Retirement Dividend Stock,"Hey you guys, I just wanna share something here off the top of my head.

So SFTBY started paying a dividend for the first time in 2018 of .15 and has already doubled it this year to .33. The company is also ridiculously undervalued relative to its net assets. It is highly leveraged at present but is planning to spin off the mobile division and thereby jettison a lot of debt too.

This is the only thing in my IRA now, I’ve only been in it for two weeks and I’m up nearly 20%. 

It’s the only way for regular people to own Foxconn, ARM, Boston Dynamics, Grab, Didi Chuxing, Uber, et al. And im sure everyone knows the nice piece of Nvidia they own and the huge chunk of Alibaba. 

World governments, Apple, Qualcomm, Oracle, and others all trust billions with Softbank. We should too. Masayoshi is already looking to start grooming an apprentice and wants this to be the biggest holding company in the world that will last 300 years.

He looks you directly in the eye. “But you've seen me everywhere, haven't you?” A film projects behind him. Images of rockets exploding, one 65 million dollar failure after another.

“I staked my career on colonizing mars. But now my shame will no longer define my legacy. This is the day a Muskrat will rise from the ashes, adorned in its Tesla flightsuit, and ascend to immortality.”

The film changes. Images of people, their eyes wide with fear or caution, like they've never seen a camera before.

“Uncontacted indigenous people.” He pours milk into his Cheerios. “The last human beings on Earth who've never had contact with the civilized world.” He’s still pouring the milk. “But what good are people who don't purchase goods and perpetuate the menstruation-like cycle of innovation?” The milk is overflowing from the mug, leaking off the table and into his lap. The heat radiating from his boardshorts evaporates the fluid into steam on contact.

“So I asked myself, what would our heavenly father do?” He removes his shirt to reveal an elaborate crucifixion tattoo across his veiny, throbbing pectorals, his sandy brown chest hair growing around it in patches. His left nipple replaces the head of Longinus, his right the head of Mary Magdalene.

“And do you know what he told me?” He grabs you by the hand. “Do you know the universal secret?” He briefly fondles your breasts, but you push him away, flirtatiously mouthing no, no, no. You know you want him. But you don't remember how you got here. You don't remember your name. You remember nothing but Elon.

“Our Father, through his only-begotten son, came before me in a dream. The Almighty and the Christ sat side-by-side in the holiest of holies, the inner sanctum, not of heaven, but of meaning itself. And behold, I saw the Mammon. Truly I say to you, the three were not in bitter dispute, but united together, each an introgial piece of the Holy Trinity, the base-most expression of God.”

“And what did God say to you, big boy?” You say, playing footsie with his milk-soaked black business socks.

“Ignorant harlot!” He screams, throwing the mug of Cheerios and milk in your face. “Do you desire my milk so badly, you can not discern for yourself God’s message from this vision?” You shake your head no, ashamed you've displeased your master.

He rubs your head, massaging the milk on his hands deep into your scalp. “Child, do you wish to possess this esoteric knowledge?”

“Yes, Papi Musk”, you say. Your conscious mind awakens as you realize you have no control of your actions, words, or emotions. “Your lessons begin now”, he says, loosening the drawstring on his shorts.

You pull his shorts off and see a large pink udder with four teets stuffed into his Teen Titans Go! boxer-briefs. You lovingly guide a teet through the folds. It's already dripping with pre-milk. “Suck it”, he says, grabbing your hair and pulling you closer. You obey your master and begin suckling. His warm milk squirts down your throat.

“Everybody has a place in the system”, he says. “as ordained by God’s laws of nature. Even when they seem lost and useless, He appoints a prophet to help them—to do His will.” His milk is getting warmer and more viscous.

“Truly I say to you, that prophet will channel the Mammon, and through him all people will find their purpose.” His piping hot milk globs down your throat and scalds your esophagus, but you can't let go of the teet.

“The Tesla Amphibious Observation Vessel. Now the world’s leaders and innovators have a window into the lives of primitive man, commodifying their existence and finally giving them purpose.”

The film changes. Images of the vessel in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit—crushing cars, busses, and people while Elon, Jeff Bezos, Charles Koch, Oprah Winfrey, and Kanye West peer out the observation window.

Facebook worth $240/share. DD inside,"1. Facebook saw it’s mobile ad revenue increase to $11bn in Q1FY18. Revenue growth is sustainable at a 39&amp;#37; rate in 2018, will slow to 25&amp;#37; in 2019, and drop to 23&amp;#37; in 2020. However, there is considerable potential related to emerging properties, specifically Instagram and Instagram TV.

2. Gross margins will modestly narrow on an annual basis through 2020, but that is expected due to increased security costs and substantial spending on products, infrastructure, and global expansion, which will in turn lower EBITDA margin and could decline to 61&amp;#37; by next year. However, I see this as a beneficial factor as Facebook has been open with their guidance about this and this should allow them to continue growing the business.

3. Facebook has a very flexible balance sheet which will allow it to grow mobile technology with geographic expansion and acquisitions. Facebook has $44bn in cash and investments as of March 2018, and I see this as a positive for potential investment and M&amp;A.

Facebook's market cap today is just under $600 billion, and it has 2.2 billion monthly users and $27 billion in operating profit. That equates to operating revenue of $5.54 per user and a multiple of 31 times operating profit. Because of its large opportunity in mobile, social, and digital advertising, I think Facebook can grow to 2.5 billion monthly users and earn $20 per user, racking up $50 billion in operating profit. At 20 times that figure, you'd have a market capitalization of $1 trillion.

CSX 7/17 ER - DISCUSS,"Okay so AIR ER did **NOT** work out. Did not help that the market took a big old dump so the dip buy is not in for AIR like AVAV. That brings my recent ER plays to 3/4 (AVAV,NKE,HELE,AIR). 

That being said I want to foster some conversation on an upcoming ER.. CSX. 

BULL CASE:
BTFD on CSX. Train routes are from the north-south Midwest to east coast and is one of the four trains on the monopoly board. They continue to report strong revenue growth (did not include the $3-4 billion in tax savings) despite a slight decline in coal car loads and revenue per car load. This is primarily related to cutting employee costs and improving efficiency. China is expected to buy more US coal to reduce the trade deficit with the United States and i believe there will be a resolution to this trade war BS soon.  

I’m scaling into 7/20 and 8/3 near the money calls. Currently have $64.5 and $65 calls and waiting for the runup. I am going to risk-off a portion of my calls assuming CSX returns to the $66-$67 range. I fully expect CSX to beat ER given the increase in exports. 

BEAR CASE 

CSX PUTS
CSX been improving numbers by cutting costs. The most recent ER they reported increased revenues despite not including the tax cut savings of 3.6B or reductions in coal carload ridership and revenue per car. They have reduced their workforce to keep revenues up. Coal production is expected to continue its decline because of a decrease in domestic coal consumption (thanks Obama/natural gas). Now, exports ***may*** increase but the revenue per car load is still not expected to increase given coal pricing and because of the Chinese tariffs. If the Chinese trade war continues, they may seek coal from a different source. They originally were planning to buy more American coal, but given the current relationship, I don’t see China doing us any favors. 

I’m going to sell my calls on a bounce and buy puts for ER.

XLF (the QQQ for Banks who have earnings next week),"I know some of you sluts are out there, looking to pay only cents for an option that is safer than putting your dick in a fire ant pitt. And there is a high volume ETF for you that relates back to stocks that have earnings this week and next week.

**$XLF:** July 20th 27.50 sits at .20c....

Next week we have: , $JPM, $BAC, $WFC, $C $GS, $JEW, $MS, $AXP... all of which relate back to this ETF.. Banks are far from ATHs from a month ago and have lots of potential to climb back. The party begins this Friday at open with some of the smaller fishes and carries on everyday next week with the bigger fishes. Dont waste time playing darts with one of these. Play em all with less risk and make equally the same money you would hope to make otherwise. Buy a portion and if we get a bloody thursday this week, buy more.

I think it’s about time we short SNAP,"I realized today i barely use snapchat anymore.  it has sucked balls since that horrible update way back and i hardly see stories on it anymore.  even my annoying girlfriend is starting to lose interest

then today i got a snapchat and it was a friend with caption “peace snapchat friends, deleting the app”. 

that’s pretty much the only dd i hate the app need as i personally hate stupid people recording all their dumb shit all the time. 

the only thing i’m worried is all the gay teenagers of this day being obsessed with their phones and social media, although i feel like insta is taking over. 

going to buy big puts soon i’m just not sure what expiration.  possibly Jan 2019
