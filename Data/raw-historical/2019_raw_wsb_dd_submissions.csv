Price of Wheat DD,"So the price of Wheat is currently at a low but had been increasing mainly on trade talk news for the past month. The price of grains in general has gone up but wheat seems to perform better in particular.  China doesn't buy much wheat but it's still benefitting from the talks.

Now 2020 is the start or end, however you look at it, of an 11 year solar cycle.  This means potentially more volatility in weather on Earth. Possibly a colder winter, earlier spring, and more drought.  This could lead to a potential crop failure especially for wheat. One article predicts a 40% upside.

Australia has been on fire and wheat production is down. The USDA predicts a great year for wheat so if it isn't the price could rise significantly.

The play: you could buy futures but for those of us, including me, that don't have access to futures, $WEAT is an ETF that tracks the futures of wheat. There's also consistent spikes in July, which is why I'm buying July 2020 $5 calls. As always this is one autist's opinion and any plays are at your own risk. Good luck!

TLDR: price of wheat increasing, buy July 2020 $WEAT calls",jep777,1577835957,1,38,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eiatp9/price_of_wheat_dd/

"My last buy of the second decade of the 21st century or ""I actually autistically believe I'll make thousands, even tens of thousands on a shitty chinese stock, having paid $182""","I'm not gonna lie, I'm entering this new decade and year with some pretty stupid positions (I mean NVDA puts and ACB calls levels of stupid), and this one I'm feeling smart right now but it's possibly the stupidest of them all. Be that as it may, I think I've found the golden pass into infinite tendies, and I'd like to share my play with you, so you can call me retarded (but don't, since comparing me to actually mentally-handicapped people is extremely offensive to them).   


Now there's this company called JOYY INC ($YY), of which I got acquainted with by searching for the [Top of all time post on /r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/top/?t=all). Now this company showcases absurd revenue growth, it's actually making money, and has huge operational margins. Balance sheet looks solid af. Like, please, someone tell me what the fuck is wrong here. Like, even if you value it at like half of what $SNAP is worth, you are walking away with 100% gains. Company is only worth 4.2B. And everything on this one looks better, from growth to... everything. I mean, I understand it's a chinese company but come on. It is right now near it's 6-month support and yada yada a bunch of voodoo TA shit that don't work. 

Hell, even the morons that call themselves ""analysts"" hold the stock on high regard. Deutsche Bank has a price target on it of 83, JPMorgan 90, Goldman Sachs 84..

"Why stonks only go up, and when they won't","The ridiculous levels that the market is sustaining is a direct result of easy money the Fed is supplying to banks and other corporations. Debt, which is cheap as hell right now, combined with (totally not) QE creates such a brainlessly perfect environment for going long in. The Fed, with its low interest rates and repo market debt monetization, is literally screaming at you to buy equities.

However, this upwards-only rollercoaster cannot last forever; the Fed will either have to stop giving away candy or face inflation. They're most likely unwilling to do the second, because it would fuck up the entire world, so they'll have to start raising interest rates and stop injecting money into lending markets.

We're CGC Bulls Now (Why Cannabis is Up Today),"Hey Guys,

Can't mention a company that begins with A because it's a penny stock and therefore it will immediately get any post involving it removed from this subreddit. Therefore, let's talk about the sector as a whole.

Below are my theories on why the Cannabis market is up today:

Everyone keeps asking why Cannabis is up 10%:

1. Tax loss harvesting season is over so people can re-enter Cannabis
2. Beverage announcement and further announcements for Cannabis 2.0 will be tomorrow
3. Short interest is squeezing. As stated before there is a heavy short interest in Canadian Cannabis companies specifically and in the Cannabis sector in general. That is now squeezing as tax loss harvesting season ends and portfolios can re-enter Vannabis and re-balance their risk to include cannabis in 2020

Some $BBBY DD before 2020-01-08 AMC earnings,"Evening fellow autists,

I saw a couple posts on $BBBY being a dumpster fire, and their earnings is coming up Jan 8th AMC. I figured i'd do some quick DD/financials on Bed Bath and Beyond. See below for the bullet points.

From a technical perspective, BBBY has had a 51% return in the last year. However, it's 5yr chart is horrendous, and are we really shocked? Let's get serious: BBBY is becoming more and more irrelevant to consumers, particularly when you can go to $WMT, $TGT, Ikea, $AMZN etc, etc to do whatever you need to furnish your own dumpster fire.

It should also not come as a surprise then, that the short interest on the stock is up about 64% in the last 12m, with the ""day's to cover"" period also increasing.

In terms of financials, it may *seem like* a mixed bag.

Revenue is slightly down while the COGS is unchanged/up 0.2%, making gross profit margin drop 8%. When you include the increase in OpEx/SG&amp;A, operating income has dropped an impressive 44% in the last year - $761m down to $423m. EBITDA has a similar outcome, down 29% in the last year, and thus EPS dropping 133% ($3.04/sh to -$1.02/sh).

The income statement figures seem to paint a grim picture.

Cash flow figures seem to paint a different picture. Operating cash flow is up 7%, primarily  from large increases in changes in working capital (-$124m to $283m), +$100m in ""other working capital"". Interesting to note that their operating cash flow increase was dampened by their $104m in deferred taxes payable.

In terms of investment activities, there was $50m less in investments in PPE, but an additional $440m purchase of investments, alongside the sale/maturity of $539m in investments. Note, this is NOT purchasing/issuing stock of BBBY. 

Financing activities are interesting. Dividend payments have been increasing, but the 2019 financials show almost half the amount of common stock was repurchased. As a result of increased operating cash flow, less capital expenditure, free cash flow increased a solid 22%.

Note that these figures are the 2/8/2019 and 2/28/2018 figures as comparison, NOT the TTM. the TTM figures are especially grim, particularly for net income. Inventory quadruples. the TTM free cash flow is less than half of the 2/28/2019 figure ($593m vs TTM of $266m)

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts here? I feel the thesis for a short position is justified in the financials and outlook of the company; never mind its continued irrelevance. However, what concerns me is that if I were to go short, and they post a better than pessimistic earnings, there may be a decent short squeeze. Analysts see a continued slide, but if it doesn't, may be a sizable pop.

Ultimately, i would probably short shares few days prior, then sell a $14 put as a 'covered put' position in the weekly to get assigned at a nice profit.

ACB - The Blind leading the Autistic,"TL:DR:  Any calls should be kept closer to strike as mooning depends on some weird shit happening and dilution will hold it down.  A few strikes out and you are depending on retail overreacting to some piece of news enough to squeeze shorts.  Gabor the Blind guy wasn’t enough to make that happen so it would likely take real news.  ACB has limited exposure to US market but if US legalized on federal level it would moon.  Selling calls a few strikes out is likely free money but is priced accordingly and the risk of stock dropping below price + premium is real.

Puts have super limited upside since the stock is sub $2.  $2 out for June is .60 right now so even if it went to zero your upside is capped at $1.40 or 225%.  Hell even if it dropped to $1 you would only see a 66% return.  Selling puts has some merit unless retail decides they had enough.  

Since there seems to be a post every 8 hours on this stock ever since Gabor the Blind Guy because WSB famous.  Let’s review where the company is at before we create anymore bag holders or yacht owners.

ACB is currently trading at its lowest price since October of 2017, back before Recreational Pot was legal in Canada, and was trading around $10 as recently as first quarter this year.  So in this year where stocks only went up it dropped 80%.

So that should mean it’s primed for recovery to the moon right?  Except there were good reasons that it dropped.  It made a lot of acquisitions by issuing shares and those acquisitions were definitely buying overpriced assets at the top of their value as demonstrated by the $3b CAD of goodwill sitting on their books.  Then back in November they further diluted shares by converting debt to shares.

Back when they were $2 in 3rd quarter 2017  they had 371m shares outstanding, as of right now that number is around 1.1b.  So even if they miraculously found a deal that would be worth a billion dollars the value is about $1 a share.

When you hear discussion about money mismanagement this is part of what they are talking about.  The other part is construction of two new growing facilities that was started and subsequently stopped.  Over the past 18 months they have invested over 300m into two giant facilities to increase capacity.  However as the past two quarters have demonstrated the Canadian market is currently oversupplied.  It’s building ice makers to sell ice to eskimos up in Canada.

Combine those factors and you have a ton of cash burn, combine that with limited revenue and you have people talking about the company going out of business.  Short sellers have noticed and account for a third of the volume in the market for awhile now.

Which brings us to you the Yahoo article that was posted recently with a price target of zero.  First off fuck that guy he cost me some money, second of all he was kind of right about their balance sheet although extremely pessimistic and ignored a few pretty important facts.  

His theory was that because of cash burn ACB would run out of money within two quarters due to limited capacity for lending.  They have $152m in cash and burned through 130m in previous quarter and only have lending capacity on their line of credit of another 150m.  So the idea being they do that for 2 more quarters and boom out of money and no more access to banks because their balance sheet is already carrying too much debt.  

Except the converted half of their debentures in November which accounted for 30m in payments in each quarter and halted construction on the two additional greenhouse which in most recent quarter accounted for at least 50m of that cash burn, possibly more.  Now they also had an influx of 80m last quarter from selling securities.  That’s page 8 of below.

https://assets.ctfassets.net/rhxhcf3cql1g/7p3Er952vcGekZovryfU7y/6969db5521c23a7f172d96805e5876e5/FS_2019.09.30_11.14.2019.pdf

However on page 18 you can see the book value on construction in progress went up by 90m.

So in a best cash scenario that burn would drop by $30-40m at existing revenue.  $30m less in payments on the debenture and $90m less on construction but not getting 80m from selling securities.  Which drops their cash burn down into the $80-90m range with $300m available before needing more cash or issuing shares.  That’s also on existing revenue.  So yeah fuck that guy.

Which brings us to recent news insider selling.  A director sold 4m shares and then asking Cam Battley their CCO to step down.  It’s been speculated that they moved him to fit in a Coke exec, I would say look at the past 9 months and tell me if you would demote someone that presided over your stock dropping 80% by buying a bunch of overpriced assets and building ice makers in Canada.  I would banish him to Australia as well. 

So they have a rough balance sheet, have dealt with a tough roll out in Canada and have demoted a c-suite guy.  All of moves look right for a turn around to profitability especially now that edibles and vapes have rolled out in Canada.  There are reasons to believe they can turn it around long term, however with the share dilution a trip to the moon is really damn unlikely.

However it’s of significant note that ACB is the most heavily owned stock on Robinhood right now which means you have a significant number of retail bag holders in play.  The fact that the stock dropped like a stone and it’s still number one implies that there are still a significant number of those 1b shares floating around.  Looking at how a yahoo article impacted the price, it’s likely safe to say you can’t expect any rational activity from this group.

TL:DR:  Any calls should be kept closer to strike as mooning depends on some weird shit happening and dilution will hold it down.  A few strikes out and you are depending on retail overreacting to some piece of news enough to squeeze shorts.  Gabor the Blind guy wasn’t enough to make that happen so it would likely take real news.  ACB has limited exposure to US market but if US legalized on federal level it would moon.  Selling calls a few strikes out is likely free money but is priced accordingly and the risk of stock dropping below price + premium is real.

If you are wanting free money make sure you purchase ACB on Monday,"Please hear me out before inversing me on this one!

So ACB has had a rough year, I'm sure I don't even need to go into details. Weakness in business, crashing stock, top exec's leaving, insiders selling, massive amounts of people shorting, etc. The list will go on and on. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, people are forgetting we are in the December dump season. That's right! Just about all stocks, this year are up 40% causing massive tax bills for anyone cashing out! However, what's the one way to reduce that? That's right dumping your $ACB stocks for $2 to capture their 80% loss from buying early in the year at $10. 

&amp;#x200B;

Heres where things get interesting. Earlier this week a bald blind guy posts a fake story about a possible partnership with coke. Despite nobody falling for this shit (because how the fuck can the blind guy have filmed the video if he's blind), the stock moved up 9% instantly! 

Why might the stock move that much if the story was so short-lived? That's because the huge hedge funds shorting it were quick to rebuy their shares to avoid a potential short-squeeze if the rumor was prolonged. What this means comes Jan. 1st, that tax year resets so people won't be selling to capture loss and hedge funds can start to take advantage of short squeezing people. That is why it's likely not going any lower and buying it can reap a massive profit when it does pump.

&amp;#x200B;

TL-DR: Stock is down due to massive short-sellers taking advantage of knowing in this year there are not many stocks to sell for loss-capturing tax purposes. The stock also is easily pumped which can cause a rapid short squeeze. The best thing to do is get into prior to Jan 1st for when the momentum picks up.",Boneyg001,1577595840,1,66,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eh1uvf/if_you_are_wanting_free_money_make_sure_you/

T$LA my analysis,"As you all know Tesla is pushing is limits everyday, and that's highest being 425, hers my key take away.
1. It was pushing high everyday. For instance, on Monday it Rose from 411 to 422 and closed at 419.22. which clearly meant the stock is still going to rise. And we saw what happened yesterday December 24th. It Rose from 422 425. But, the day started with a huge sell off followed by a recovery.
2. The technicals still says the stock is going to push higher.
Monthly, weekly and daily RSI and macd is bullish. But, on the daily chart RSI almost seem to have been reached 100%. Which means the stock will go for correction on the daily chart. If so, we should see a correction until 400 (or 370 on Weekly chart) And go back up after daily and weekly correction since the monthly chart is showing signs of bullish. 
Since we saw a huge sell off on Wednesday, I would expect the same tomorrow and the stock should begin recovering in later hours of the day. Until the signs show over bought ( I believe the time is very near may be about 3 days or until Jan 1). It should then start selling off.
Keeping this in mind, my target Tesla price is 450.
I think the time of this ridiculous rally might be coming to an end. I would be careful from January on wards.

A Blind Guy Just Broke NDA About ACB and Coca Cola Partnership,"Some blind guy's dad makes child proof can lids and the retarded kid took one to make a youtube video about how blind people find it hard to take off lids.

From the autist that told you to buy ITCI before it happened ... Buy AIMT!!!,"Hello retards,

Today I bring you DD for another bio-pharm stock that will not moon before you have a chance to get in.  
The company name is Aimmune Therapeutics Inc (AIMT).  This stock had an Adcom vote of 7-2 in favor of approval.  
These peeps are slinging oral immunotherapy for peanut allergies.

News of the potential FDA approval for the drug Palforzia (AR101) is not baked in yet at the $32/share price.    
In fact, Nestle bought 18% of this company at $30.27!   The PDUFA date is Jan 17,2020 (likely earlier)   
This stock has 92% institutional ownership.  Upon approval, tutes will buy more.

 A survey of allergists by Piper Jaffray's Christopher Raymond was overwhelmingly positive.   
Out of 45 allergists polled, 44 said they'd probably prescribe Palforzia if approved by the FDA. 

Aimmune also submitted a marketing application for Palforzia to the European Medical Agency  
(Europe’s version of the FDA). A decision is expected in the second half of 2020. 

The FDA approves 90% of positive adcoms.  (This is pretty good odds for those that don't math).  
If you heard the parents of the kids aged 4-17 that were in the studies, it was pretty heartwarming.  
Aren't we always saying ""think of the children!"" ??  
TLDR - Go Long - Let's make those tendies!!!  &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

\-------

&amp;#x200B;

Norway was like the only country to escape the 2008 meltdown unscathed. Reasons why? Probably because it’s a super wealth country and it’s democratic socialist model (government owns minority shares in most industries, and is uninvolved in corporate operations) gives it a lot of stability in times of trouble. With everyone in the U.S. (me included) worried about a stock market contraction, where can you park money? Cash gang faces a slow burning fire of upticking inflation, gold is gay, and bonds aren’t sexy at all. Like who buys bonds, my grandpa cashing her social security check for pain medicine? Gtfo. “Emerging markets” = corrupt markets, and everyone knows China is a ticking time bomb economically, plus Trump is gonna get reelected and return to raw dogging big daddy Xi, which may lead to war. Also, there is no way I’m putting money in shitholes like Mexico, India, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Norway is extremely stable. It isn’t in debt. It doesn’t’ have an insanely reckless financial system. Its people are attractive. The socialist model brings with it the benefits of capitalism (it is a capitalist country) with a strong welfare state. Global warming will open up the North Sea Route in the late 2020s, which is the quickest trade route between China / Japan and Europe. Russia owns most of this route but Norway owns the end of it…and this will require a massive amount of infrastructure development. Moreover, global warming will make Norway more agriculturally productive, and open up mineral resources in the Arctic…but bullshit aside, Norway is dope af. Sexy fucking people, strong environmental and social laws, beautiful environment, engaged population and sound governance, and its not in the EU (so its not gay). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Many of the things that make me worried about the future (global warming, chaotic international system, massive corporate / government debt, etc) are NOT factors in Norway. The country literally just does shit right. Since we all know TA is bullshit anyway, go with what you know: Norway is probably a good custodian of your money in times of trouble, and bro, trouble is on its way. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Just sunk 20k in $NORW. Its an ETF with a .5% fee but it’s an index with broad exposure. Gonna hold for the next two years as a safety for my US holdings (400k in cash, indexes, ADBE, etc) then cash out if (1) the U.S. stock market drops bigly. If it doesn't, I'll probably sell into 2021-2022 as environmental change begins to get priced in, and north sea route infrastructure starts being constructed. 

&amp;#x200B;

\------

\*\*TL/DR: Constant anxiety about a recession in the U.S., oversold stock market, makes US indexes / stocks risky. Bonds suck, though, and gold sucks too. Inflation is ticking up, so going #cashgang is a slow BBQ to your tendies. Norway is a solid place to park money. The country is extremely stable, wealthy af, and performed really well through the 2008 crisis.  Global warming will benefit it in the near term (20-years or so).

PTON might have 2m Members and is Sandbagging Subscriber Growth,"As many of you know, I have owned PTON calls for a few weeks and it hasn’t gone the way I thought it would. The short interest is about 70% or so, with the most recent short borrow rate (from Friday) at about 10%. It has the ingredients for a short squeeze, but hasn’t had the news to actually create one yet. I believe that is about to change. 

On Dec 19th, one of PTON’s instructors, Jess King, mentioned that the company has 2 million members during their live class. Shoutout to u/gsgun for bringing it to our attention in a post! A member is a user account. As per PTON’s S1, the average subscribing household has 2.0 members. Think of a couple that owns a Peloton exercise bike and each person has their own member account to track their progress. When PTON IPOd, they had 1.4m members and as of last quarter (fiscal 1Q2020), they had 1.6m members. If they hit 2m members by December 19th, this is a big deal. 

To get to 2m members, they added about 400k members (accounts). If the avg membership per subscription stayed the same, that means they added about 200k new subscribers with 11 days (including Xmas shopping days!) to go before the end of the quarter. So maybe by the time the current quarter (fiscal 2Q2020) ends, they will have added 250k connected subscribers? 

This would be a huge deal. On their prior quarter’s call, they guided to having 680-685k by the end of December. This compares to having 562,774 connected subscribers at the end of September, or essentially guiding to growth of about 122k connected subs. They could essentially double that numbers this quarter. They could be on pace for 813k subs this quarter, nearly hitting their FULL YEAR fiscal 2020 guidance of 885-895k connected subs. 

This might have been a passing mention of 2m subs, or maybe she rounded up, but clearly if it is even CLOSE to 2m subs, they are on pace to blow their own guidance out of the water and accelerate growth…",MikeThePutz,1577045512,1,139,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ee9mlm/pton_might_have_2m_members_and_is_sandbagging/

Energy Transfer is Tendies,"Hi there fellow autists, autist here reporting on a stock that actually is tendies. As in ten (percent) d(ividend) ies. It is of course Energy Transfer ET.

As a cohort when we look as oil and the energy sector- maybe they deserve to have been beat up over the past few years, I mean once Musk is driving everyone around in his electric blenders there will be a ridiculous amount of stranded oil assets. Natural gas is different, it gives off half of the pollutants that burning oil does and is actually looked upon favorably as a renewable energy source. And TX is just brewing with the stuff. Plus their CEO just bought about over 100mil worth of the stock. Plus there have been three upside ratings over the past year. There seems to be momentum in this uptrend, and if this puppy dips below 12 for some reason it would be time to hop on board, the momentum is palpable. At a PE of like 10 it is undervalued, ET has a fair value estimate of 22 bucks and there have been three consecutive years of growth in operating income, and they have finally gone into the black with their free cash flow. I understand there are other players out there and mistakenly bought up Competitors on the basis that they have stronger ROIC, not the return I would have hoped for by now- gas companies are now so beleaguered they have in many instances taken part in di-worseification. Energy Transfer is not that and wants the spot devoted to “midstream-turnaround” on your portfolio. 


TLDR- ET is trading at half of its fair value. There is a 10% dividend. Natural gas and midstream bottom called.",runningmandan,1576679531,1,25,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecddg3/energy_transfer_is_tendies/

I suspect Roku is fudging usage numbers," when I turned on my TCL Roku TV today, it was on this app called ""Newsy"" playing ""Ad 4 of 8"". 

first of all, what the fuck is Newsy? I have for sure never installed that shit. I went into my history and apparently it was added to my account about a month ago..suspicious.

second, when I clicked the on button the audio for the ad IMMEDIATELY started playing, mid way through ad. I have my TV set to go to sleep mode and not turn off all the way..but let's say hypothetically I DID have newsy, and somehow blacked out last night in the middle of ad 4 of 8..it saved my spot IN THE AD?

I think ROKU is gonna start to hit new monthly highs,"Roku is a momo darling, and also extremely volatile.  Ive been trading it for a while now, and recently got the hang of making a decent amount of money in it.  I posted a while back about going from 1500 or so to 12.5k and reinvested 2500 to go at it again.  I put all 2500 into some calls for early janaury and assuming this thing bounces off the current floor, ima let it ride and then buy some 160s for mid January.  If my plan takes hold, easy gains.  

Why do I think it will do this?  

1.  Its a momo darling.  Enough shorted to get some filthy short covering runs, but tons of people pumping this so it tends to have crazy runs, especially after big pullbacks.  

2.  It just had a big pullback from their CFO leaving, which, was mostly priced in from him selling all of his shares about a month ago.  No news yet on why he left, but I assume its just a normal poaching.  He left on good terms it seems seeing it was a several month long process and no backlash or outspoken anything happend.  

3.  They are in a great place to hire a solid CFO and get a run from this.  ROKUs financiald have been doing extremely well.  Relatively low debt, insane growth, and the stock price reflects this.  Im sure they have more than enough money to hire an amazing CFO that is looking to capitalize on their amazing run and further it.  

4.  It just bounced off a strong floor and ran up several % only to get hit with the dumb money sell off once the cfo news announced, but it held strong.  In other words, held strong through the bad news, could easily rip once new cfo plans are announced, probably will happen soon.  

5.  Everyones been bragging about their holiday sales the whole time.  They have been selling insane amounts, but the CFO news took the hit.  Usually once it bounces of floors like this, a wave of upgrades will come in.  My guess is sometime soon a wave of upgrades is gonna come in, itll rally, theyll release good news about holiday sales, and kill it on the ER and itll rally to new monthly highs, and close to ATH then find a new floor.  As is the trend.  

Godspeed fellow autists.  I see this rallying tommorrow after holding strong today.  I think it will open in the green, and do a nice run up, and upgrades will fuel the further run.

The Stock Bubble is real.. hear me out,"Trump is and has committed treason.

The one you will likely never hear about, that effects you the most is systematic stockmarket manipulation.

Trump nominated Jerome Powell to the head of the Federal Reserve, Jay Clayton to the SEC, and Christopher Giancarlo head the CFTC.

The last few years the Federal Reserve has been pumping cash into the market. Also known as Market Injections (to help banks have liquidity with cash in the market). This allows them to pump more financial institute cash into the market (when its not needed).

Meanwhile at the SEC and CFTC, all these suspicious trades that happen right before and after trump very specific tweets go un-investigated.

Trump tweets coincide with some of his devious plans to pump the market as much as possible by stringing out the trade war. Pump Pump Pump.

When Trump leaves office, his cronies will undoubtedly inverse their bets on the market, and no more Market Injections, no more Trump market pump tweets, and No more volatility from China Trade war. 

After Trump leaves office, the Dems will open investigations into all these characters and their phones and emails will reveal one big clusterfuck plan to rape the American people. The market will pop like a bad out of hell.

Deficits are near all time highs around the world and the pension sht is going to blow up in everyone’s face eventually. The fed WILL NOT give up. They’ll buy equities if they have to to try to bandage this shit. Therefore, it is extremely likely the sp500 will keep running until every drop of juice is extracted.

Section 1256 tax advantage,"I’ve been seeing a lot of people posting about tax season, particularly how to minimize taxes on gains.. first and foremost, if you have gains, then congratulations... 

A big issue for retail traders is write offs and deductions that the big guys get. You need to understand capital gains and capital losses are treated entirely different than ordinary gains and ordinary losses. Without incorporating as a business you are kinda stuck without write offs and deductions that a business gets..

The one loophole for small people is section 1256.. section 1256 applies to any/most futures and indexes like SPX.. section 1256 states that gains are to be taxed at 60/40 ratio.. that means if you have 100k gain in securities that fall into section 1256 category, 60% of the 100k is taxed as LONG TERM CAPITAL GAINS and 40% will be taxed as SHORT TERM CAPITAL GAINS... that’s one big advantage.. another is the elimination of capital losses and wash sale rule BECAUSE section 1256 securities are traded as a Mark-to-Market which essentially converts gains into ordinary gains and ordinary losses.. 

With that said, I must warn all the autists on this forum that futures and indexes are not for everyone. You can incur severe losses, especially with future contracts. But with proper execution, risk can be minimized and reward can be great.

BIG GAY DD ON DHR,[removed],SoundShadowZ,1576404316,1,20,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eaxbfo/big_gay_dd_on_dhr/
$CONN or how to lose 40% of Market Cap in a week.,"Basic disclaimer: I don’t own a position in this and I wouldn’t be posting this on a weekend if I planned on opening one on Monday.  Been awhile since I have done any actual company analysis so feedback would be welcome.

I got bit pretty hard on this after earnings when it tanked and then kept tanking. It beat on earnings but reported significant decline in same store sales (5-9%). Was trading at 21 prior to earnings.  20% drop in price would move it to $16.80.  52 week low was at $15.40 on 6/1/2019.  Had recovered to $17.17 on 7/1/2019.   Post earnings it dropped to $14.15 at 10:00 AM.  Seems safe to recover to $16.00 by 4/27/19.  It wasn’t.

As of Friday $CONN is at $12.59 and is still marching downward.  Initially it seemed like it was Market inefficiency with a smaller cap stock.  They had heavy institutional holders 45% of outstanding shares, so maybe it was an institution unwinding it’s shares from those positions. That could cause it to get oversold and result in a decent rebound.

But why would they be looking to get out?  Looking at the balance sheet things aren’t bad.  Total assets are 2.156b , total liabilities are 1.5b, leaving 630m of shareholder equity with 30m shares outstanding.  $21 worth of assets per share with a $12 stock price isn’t a bad deal. 

It’s where you get into asset breakdown where there are problems.  1.32b of their assets are customer accounts receivable.  

To understand why exactly this is a problem, Conn’s business model is selling product with in store financing like a buy here pay here used car lot.  Which means the folks that owe them money are not the most ideal credit worthy customers.  If you look at the average credit score of sales financed it’s 609.  That isn’t good.  In fact the above category shows that currently 10% of all accounts are 60+ days past due and an additional 17.8% of their accounts are re-aged (means an extension on a payment has occurred or some other recovery method implemented)

27.8% of 1.32b is 366.96m, divided by 30m shares is $12 and change, so now we are talking about $9 of shareholders equity plus what % that 366.96m of money you can expect to collect out of folks who are already 60 days past last or have missed payments.   

Management seems to be aware of how large a problem this is and earnings mentioned how they are being better about underwriting and that is driving half of the decline in same store sales.  That’s a good thing as it means the new debt that is coming in should be better than the old debt rolling off the books, but the credit score hasn’t increased to go along with it.

$CONN just got downgraded to a price target of $15 but even that might be a bit generous, specifically citing same store sales decreases as the problem. However until the books get a bit cleaner from a debt perspective that even looks risky.  That combined with a steep premium on options makes this a rough play until it gets closer to $9 or $10 and even then it depends on how confident you are in them recovering money from folks with a history of not paying bills.

TL:DR $CONN asset valuation is predicated on a lot of folks paying their bills that have a history of not paying their bills but the price isn’t low enough to even take that risk.",Senseisntsocommon,1576373212,1,18,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eashj1/conn_or_how_to_lose_40_of_market_cap_in_a_week/

Somebody needs to tell me if I am retarded or on to something,"Okay so I watch $NFLX, you watch $NFLX, but how much money do they actually make? 

Netflix premium is $16 a month. According to Google, as of October 16th, 2019 Netflix has 158.3 million subscribers. Assuming everyone subscribed to Premium (unlikely) that means that at MAXIMUM $NFLX is making $28,800,000,000. 

But what kind of costs do they need to cover? According to:
 https://www.statista.com/statistics/587671/netflix-employees/

$NFLX has 7,100 full time employees. Assuming that they all get paid $20,000 a year (unlikely, lol) that would cost $NFLX $142,000,000. Then according to:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/comicbook.com/movies/amp/2019/01/20/netflix-spending-15-billion-original-content-streaming/

And

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.adweek.com/creativity/netflix-is-spending-more-on-marketing-this-year-than-some-of-its-rivals-are-on-content/amp/

$NFLX is going to spend $12,000,000,000 on original content,$15,000,000,000 on
programming and $2,000,000,000 on marketing. This means their yearly costs are $29,142,000,000 MINIMUM, as I'm not factoring in any of the other costs that can be associated with running a business, and I'm low-balling their labor cost to the extreme. This means that they will likely lose at least $342,000,000 this year.

BURGER KING SPOILED THE NEW STARS... BUY QSR PUTS,"Huge DD coming out of Germany (Note: I do not speak German)

Burger King German youtube channel is currently running an ad campaign called Spoiler Whopper in which if you walk into this Burger King restaurant and say out loud the spoilers for the new movie The Rise of Skywalker into BK's app, you get a free whopper. The entire restaurant is covered in spoilers and I can say pretty convincingly that many of the spoilers are true as they have been collaborated by the most prominent leaders in the r/starwarsleaks sub who have previously leaked the other 2 movies correctly. It seems that Burger King is not working with Disney on this ad campaign as they had to censor the actual name of the movie when someone was saying it. Burger King is owned by Restuarant Brands International, ticker sign QSR. I think it is safe to say Disney is gonna be hitting dem whopper boys with a lawsuit. 

Also, why get tendies when you can go to Germany and get a free whopper?

That being said, many retards are going to watch these videos and download CashApp to realize these bullshit hacks don’t work. But hey, they still have the app. Why would they delete it.

"$AYX Alteryx, dropped on fake news and rebounds","Not a name I regularly follow, but it popped up on my radar as a market loser today so I decided to look into it more.

A drop of 12% to lows of 95 from opening highs of 107.  It rebounded to 98s at the close.  So what could explain this sudden drop on no news?

This  https://twitter.com/sprucepointcap/status/1204863125473955841?s=19

Seems one of the world's most prolific short firms had a rumor circulating that they were going to release a short attack report on AYX.  This rumor propagated through to potentially prolific followers with enough power to drop the stock like a rock.

In the closing moments of the bell, Spruce capital debunked this rumor and the price sprang up 5% immediately.  

Expect the price to recovery and then some over the course of the next few days (potentially a 5-10% gain).",cautiouslego,1576111910,1,9,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9g7yn/ayx_alteryx_dropped_on_fake_news_and_rebounds/
PTON Short Interest and Borrow Rates Update,"Short interest on S3 was reported to be 70.4%, the highest since mid November. Finally we are seeing shorts running out of available shares. On IB, they are reporting they have 0 available shares to short. This was down from about 500k last week and about 1.9m 3 weeks ago. Occasionally we've seen 20-60k shares come available, but they pretty much get swallowed up as soon as they become available. This is GOOD. This is what we want to see because once there are not more available shares to short, the borrow rate starts to rise....

Which has already started happening... yesterday the IB short borrow rate on PTON was about 5-6%. Currently it is 9.8% and has been slowly rising all day. It typically makes its biggest moves after the trading day so its good to see it rising mid-day as well. That is the recipe for a squeeze. 

I added to my Jan 17th $35 and $50 calls. I haven't sold any. But just because I have the risk tolerance for this trade DOES NOT mean you should follow me. This is a high risk/high reward trade and it has a high likelihood of being a bust. Please keep that in mind when you think about following some idiot you read on the Internet like me. 

As to upcoming catalysts? The CEO is speaking at a conference today at 4:30pm. They might announce a new product (rowing machine would be nice), people might realize that their delivery people are busy as hell, etc. I don't know what the catalyst might be- but the keg is full of gunpowder and now we just need a match to light it.

Just some GME DD,"It's shorted for good reason. There's plenty of money to be made while GME goes belly up, but it ultimately goes to 0. 

Also, the guidance that we need to wait until the end of 2020 for a console release to possibly turn a profit is garbage. The manufacturers might be keeping disc drive, but the next generation of digital marketing is going to just eat up more business from GME. The CEO of GME speaks of vendor relations. The vendors do not care for GME. They would rather see them out of business. GME have been the leeches of the video game business for years. Now not even the customers want anything to do with them , they want to turn a new leaf? Pleeeease.

Is that why they committed a whopping 0.2% of their stores to take part of a test market of rebooting into hangouts. They will not even share the data on these stores. The business model already exists and they are called gaming cafes. They are dedicated to providing comfortable spaces for gamers and their friends. Their margins are thin and require lots of dedication to be successful. GME doesn't have the wherewithal and will fail miserably.

Here's my play of the day (currently awaiting approval of Level 5 options trading). It's a delta neutral quarter-covered call on Tesla. This consists of a long-expiration far out of the money short call (Jan '22 @ $600) and long 25 shares of underlying stock. The P&amp;L chart closely resembles a Cybertruck, which I believe is a positive omen that bodes well for this being a great play. https://i.imgur.com/mlU5z42.png

If TSLA hits $420ish by April '20, then I will add another 25 shares to the position. As Tesla continues to rise I will continue to add shares until the position is completely covered.

My max profit price target is $600. This will result in $6.25k profit from the original 25 shares, $2.6k in profit from the sold call, an estimated $4.5k profit from the $420 rebalancing, and an additional estimated $5k profit from further added shares, resulting in a total profit of $18k+.

* Cloudera is up more than 100% from the lows since Icahn invested and business apparently stabilizing in the last couple of quarters from low expectations. 
* When asked why he bought the 20% stake in the company Carl's only answer was ""its certainly an undervalued stock at 1.5x revenue"". I don't think he has any clue what this company even does.

* Tech is legacy, people are moving away from Hadoop Distribution and cloud vendors are eating their lunch. Don't take my word for it, have a look at what the employees are saying on Glassdoor after the merger with competitor Hortonworks. 
* New products are being hyped but won't save them.
* Company has never turned a profit, and I don't expect it to turn a profit in the near future.

Today, trading down 22% at $16.02 as of this posting.  I'm personally in 3000 shares at 15.72 on the crazy dip.  I have firepower capital to purchase another 5000 shares on dips.

Lets face it, road construction isn't going under anytime soon.  As the economy develops, so will infrastructure.  $ROAD is pretty much a monopoly in the states it operates it.  It has significant deferred revenue (since government contracts take a shit long time to pay out) which means future capital will come in fast and huge.  It sits on a potential goldmine of landmark revenue due to continued investments into the domestic economy by Trump.  It has nearly 0 debt, cash on hand, and actually turns a profit.  It is quickly expanding in the USA with recent acquisitions of 
asphault firms further cementing (that's a PUN) its foothold into the road construction monopoly in the states.

Today's trading range was from 15.53 to 18.74 which is a HUGE range.  I got in on the lower end of the range (and it still looks to be on the lower end of the range).  I see this trading back to around its upper range 18.74 in 1-2 weeks easily.  It's currently trading hugely down today due to overreaction (and profit taking) from its missed earnings (which wasn't as bad as it looks if you read into the financials).

If you followed my previous DD suggestion on $SCVL, you'd have made over 10% and banked huge gains on that (I'm still holding that FYI).  So listen to me again you autists, stop playing with turd shit like $PTON, $ROKU, $TSLA.

Reiterating the $SPCE Short Thesis,"Don't know why I feel compelled to do this, but here we are. Virgin Galactic ($SPCE) has mooned over the last couple days after receiving an extremely-optimistic upgrade from a Morgan Stanley analyst. 

In short: SPCE is the worst of all of the tech IPOs I've seen this year, and that's saying a lot. Breaking it down:

* **Fundamentals:** The company has *next-to-no revenue*. This ain't a ""not making much money yet"" situation, folks. It's a ""not making any money at all"" situation. The company had an annual revenue of $3 million this year, which is probably a fraction of what gets lost by our forum every week on OTM options. It burned $51 million in cash in Q3. The company [didn't even fucking do GAAP accounting](https://fortune.com/2019/07/09/virgin-galactic-merger-public-stock/) in its IPO lead-up. After the Morgan Stanley pump $SPCE is sitting at a market cap of $1.85 billion, **460x current sales**. Even with its own bullshit projections $SPCE would be hitting 7x EBIDTA in 2023. (This is above distressed levels.) *Really makes ya think.*
* **Market:** The company prices one-and-a-half hour flights to space at $250k. The market for these is, suffice it to say, limited. This is the extreme end of luxury discretionary spending. That spending is fueled by folks who rely on passive income from their investments. It took the company fifteen years to book 600 reservations. What do you all think is going to happen to reservations when we hit a correction? Are these people gonna sell their mansion in the Hamptons or cancel that space flight?
* **Tech Pipeline:** Technological development isn't a neat, straight line. You don't get from a buggy, half-proven technology to market dominance without hitting a thousand bumps along the way. It takes time, a lot of time. Even if things proceed smoothly, this company has no viable path to profitability within five to ten years. There's also the early adopter problem. BlackBerry was a successful smartphone company with massive market share and a good product. Where is it now? $SPCE isn't fucking BlackBerry, and it will face all the same problems with competition.
* **Accidents:** The company has a [history of fatal accidents](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html). One fuck up now and you can kiss your reservations and share price goodbye.
* **The Analyst:** Adam Jonas, the MS analyst hyping $SPCE, is the source of our pump. The man is famous for asking questions so speculative and stupid (""[what about Tesla on Mars?](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/05/23/1558607451000/The-best-of-Morgan-Stanley-s-Adam-Jonas/)"") that even Elon Musk rolled his eyes at him. The pitch for $SPCE is that it's going to disrupt airline travel with hyper-sonic technology. This is so fucking dumb it needs its own bullet point. Jonas is either really this dumb, or a useful shill to pump stocks that his firm is long on.
* **Airlines and Hyper-sonic Travel:** The airline industry is a massive, highly-regulated industry. Anyone who knows the least bit about airline business models knows that Jonas' pitch is a fucking joke. The tech necessary to make hyper-sonic flight *commercially* viable doesn't exist. Have you guys ever heard of the [Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde)? It was a plane that could get you from New York to London in under three hours, aimed at a luxury market, that started operating in *1969*. Spoiler alert: The airlines gave up on it because it lost so much fucking money.
* **The Buyers:** The buyers right now are either dumb money who weren't paying close attention to the IPO launch or opportunistic institutions. Neither is going to hold this golden turd when it gets rattled by an accident, a closer look at its financials, or general risk-off sentiment in the markets. $SPCE is the ultimate BS growth stock - growth does not do well in corrections.
* **The Bottom Line:** Short, short, a thousand times short. Price target $6 or lower within 2020, could crater completely with a fatal accident.

**tl;dr: $SPCE is an utter, deep-fried turd of a tech stock, consider yourself warned if you're long on it.**",DaGhostOfMarx,1576002275,4,99,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8ugkb/reiterating_the_spce_short_thesis/

Facebook Was Mystery Firm Bidding Against Google To Buy Fitbit,"&gt; Facebook is the mystery ""Party A"" revealed in an SEC filing that bid several times to acquire health wearables maker Fitbit, including a best and final offer of $7.30 per share.

&gt; Google announced its intentions to acquire Fitbit on Nov. 1 for about $2.1 billion in cash, or $7.35 per share. Facebook views the sale process as complete and doesn't plan to bid again now that Google has agreed to the purchase, one of the people said. 

&gt; According to the filing, Fitbit CEO James Park had dinner with ""the chief executive officer of Party A"" on June 11, 2019, to discuss the wearables technology landscape. That person would be Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, sources said. Park and other members of Fitbit's senior management had dinner with Zuckerberg again on July 2, the filing said. Zuckerberg and Park met once more in September, according to the filing.

Local DD on Iberia Bank,"Before I get started...this is about SHARES not OPTIONS so if you're too fucking self absorbed to keep reading by all means please make yourself a phat glass of Everclear and continue about your dreary, depressing day. 

 For those of you who aren't familiar with Louisiana, the primary banking corp here is called Iberia Bank ($IBKC). They're trading for $72.57 right now as I'm making this post. I personally do not use Iberia Bank (Capital One Gang), but it's the biggest bank in Louisiana. 

SO...Iberia Bank and First Horizon National Bank ($FNH) are merging, First Horizon (trading for $16.01) is the largest bank in Tennessee.   They've agreed on a merger to take place near the end of Q1 2020... Iberia shareholders will receive 4.584 shares of First Horizon for every Iberia share they own, along with a 43% increase in their dividend per share. 

After the merger, the adjoined companies will have $75 billion in assets, $57 billion in deposits, and $55 billion in loans. 

Something important to understand is that these companies are merging as equals....the CEO of Iberia bank is actually going to be the head executive chairman for the new company and the CEO of First Horizon will retain his title. 

The banks aren't changing ANYTHING after the merger, which is a good thing. These two banks are prestigious as fuck and actively involved in the local communities (not going to list all the charitable giving, look it up), they are combining to focus on growth. The merger is projected to give 16% EPS accretion to First Horizon and 22% for Iberia bank by year end 2021, but personally I think those are modest numbers that will grow higher in a shorter time. 

I'm buying as many shares of Iberia Bank as I can afford, especially if the price drops soon. In turn I will receive x(4.58) shares of First Horizon when they actually merge, along with the 43% increase in dividend I was talking about. Basically the dividend for First Horizon will increase from .16 to .20 per share at a quarterly payout rate. 

First Horizon is also acquiring 30 branches from SunTrust Banks early 2020....Ill admit I know nothing about them.

I'm long First Horizon/Iberia, I think this merger will be 'yuge' and the growth will be insane. 

By the way,,,First Horizon PE ratio: 12.29x...... Iberia PE ratio: 10.66x

PTI works on CF and has recently come up as a competitor to Vertex, a 57B dollar company that recently had Trikafta approved, a triplet (three drug combination) solution for CF patients which has shown a 10% and 14% effectiveness for homozygous/heterozygous patients in general.  


Vertex is projected to have around 4B in revenues in several years as it corners the market for CF drugs  


Issue is, their pricing is very high meaning almost all of Europe is unable to have access to the drug, and there are requirements for effectiveness (certain gene markers or mutations present) which determine if you're even eligible to benefit.  


In comes PTI, a small 180M market cap biotech that has been working on competing solutions, with a stated mission to increase access to affordable solutions for CF patients. The company has published results previously which showed an effectiveness of 8% from a doublet (two drug combination) which is already rather close to Vertex's triplet solution. Additionally they presented recently at Piper Jaffray Healthcare Conference where the CEO almost giddily spoke about the results and recent efforts they have to commercialize the doublet. The important part goes back to the fact that the european market has no solution available like Vertex' Trikafta triplet due to affordability, and is desperate for solutions for their CF population (Jeremy Corbyn literally posted/tweeted about this recently). The doublet, even today is best in class with at least twice the effectiveness of other doublets available. Europe is ""beseeching"" them to come their ASAP and they are already working with a team to fast track this to be commercialized in the european market. Doublets AIUI are traditionally also easier to get approved because less drug combinations.   


They are about to release phase 2 results from their doublet and triplet formulations which show data from an extra two weeks. Previous results were from 14 day treatments AIUI, and their competitors results have to date been based off of 28 day trials (though there is a bit of a plateau effect associated with these sorts of drugs AIUI so typically 14 day vs 28 day doesn't see a significant jump in efficacy).   


PTI however has been adjusting their approach because last time they presented the results in March it wasn't exactly how Vertex had done the trial and hence wasn't well received, so the stock dropped. This time it's in line with how Vertex had done their studies. 

[http://ir.proteostasis.com/news-releases/upcoming-events](http://ir.proteostasis.com/news-releases/upcoming-events) listen to the webcast  


here's what is priced in  


When the news that trial data would drop in Q4 2019 vs 2020 Q1 dropped, it ran up a bit to the 2.50 range and floundered there  


When the CEO spoke during the conference about the doublet and the huge potential, as well as dropping the news that data will drop in next few days (that was Thursday) it ran up even further spiking to 4.20 before settling around 3.50  


There's two main things we need to see in the data  


1. Does the doublet at 28 days exceed the triplet performance from Vertex? 
   1. If it even matches it, GG game over, Vertex is fucked since hands down a doublet is better than a triplet from a quality of life POV and this has wider potential for adoption
   2. If it doesn't but is higher than the previous 8%, or still shows 8%, then we're in a great set up still for long run
2. Does the triplet match or exceed Vertex triplet performance?
   1. If it matches or exceeds it, also GG for Vertex since this company's drug is a serious threat to their entire business
   2. If it doesn't match or exceed it then we could see this stock tumble in short term and shorts could force it down back to 2$ range in my opinion

In any event, either the doublet or triplet must exceed the vertex triplet performance for guaranteed mooning.  


On the other hand, if doublet gets close, I'll back the truck up and load up if this drops, because it's gonna be a gold mine just based on doublet alone   


Long term potential, they can corner the European market without even needing to compete with Vertex because they aren't even offered there. If they go this route which CEO already indicated is full swing ahead, this thing has much less political fighting to deal with. If they go the triplet route (unlikely to be prioritized first in my opinion), then Vertex will likely play dirty or try a hostile takeover to kill the drug and maintain monopoly pricing power

Buyout potential in my opinion is high but unclear when and whether the company would sell as their mission is to offer CF patients more options and improve their lives. They definitely wouldn't sell to Vertex in my opinion, but they may not sell to others if they don't have ability to go head to head against Vertex  


In comes Abbvie, this company has recently positioned more investment into CF and last year bought an asset from Galapagos for about 250M$ (note this was literally a failed phase 2 trial asset) just to be able to learn about potential solutions to solve CF  


They recently have made more and more signals indicating a desire to get into CF (likely due to the huge market potential for commercialization)

 [https://news.abbvie.com/news/press-releases/news-type/corporate-news/abbvie-announces-collaboration-with-cystic-fibrosis-foundation.htm](https://news.abbvie.com/news/press-releases/news-type/corporate-news/abbvie-announces-collaboration-with-cystic-fibrosis-foundation.htm) 

I could see Abbvie go for PTI as a buyout long term if doublet shows good adoption and/or either doublet or triplet exceed Vertex performance.  


Now what are the chances the data is good in the upcoming days?  


For one thing, despite their shares and stock appreciating recently, PTI has not made any offerings or raised cash (a rational choice if you think data will cause shares to tumble). The CEO seemed pretty positive when speaking about results and excited about their potential future at the webcast, and on top of that, the delta between PTI doublet and Vertex triplet is only 2% for homozygous patients at the moment (8% vs placebo vs a 10% vs placebo)  


This stock could easily soar to be worth 100$ in the long run (3-5 years), Vertex is a 57B$ company, at 220$ PPS, PTI if they have best in class doublet or best in class drug can garner at the least 1B in revenue long term given Vertex with a non European focus is projecting 4B by 2023 in revenue  


PTI today is 178M at 3.50, this thing is easily worth 1-2B in next year in my opinion  


You can go for some short term calls if you want, though calls aimed for 2020 are likely safer  


I'm riding $15k in shares in my 401k, $10k in shares in my brokerage account, $3-5k in a mix of December and long term calls.  


I fully expect to see this company blow it out of the water long term, so I'm fine if my short term december calls die and I take some losses, I'll load up and buy more and wait it out (probably first time I'll ever have long term capital gains lol)  


Feedback comments welcome, this shit was way too long a write up  


Tl;dr data drop any day, can be major positive squeeze, there is a huge short volume on this stock that can force it to spike up, if it spikes up I recommend selling 30-40% for inevitable pull back and then loading up more",cpgupta561,1575743274,1,100,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e7hu24/pti_could_be_a_long_term_1020_bagger_easily/
$PCG growing more and more likely to exit bankruptcy,"So I saw that few people were mentioning this in any DD form of way, so I thought I'd share some speculative opportunities with my fellow degenerates  


I've been playing PCG for past several weeks with selling puts and covered calls for some easy 5-10% gains weekly as a theta gang strategy  


The reason PCG has been so high IV is the stock literally swings 15-30% daily and often on random mood swings. The company declared bankruptcy a while back when it realized it was not going to be able to handle the sheer number of liabilities and over the past several months, it has been given a deadline of exiting bankruptcy by June 2020.  


To exit bankruptcy, it needs to take care of all existing liabilities from previous wildfires, which includes insurance payouts, bond holder payouts, and wildfire victim payouts. The bearish view is the liabilities which can be 30-40B are far exceeding what PCG can actually pay, and as a business this thing is going to be unlikely and unable to raise more debt or get funding. It will be forced to dilute like crazy and wipe out equity holders and even then unclear if anybody would buy the new equity. Another risk is there is a big push to have the company be taken over and run as a state managed utility.  


The bullish view is the value of their assets, long term revenue, and potential as a company means this is far undervalued if it can exit bankruptcy. Additionally the likelihood of the state taking on the massive recurrent fire liabilities let alone managing a utility is unlikely (SF can barely manage BART, why would it take on power electric grids)  


Additionally there are competing proposals on exiting bankruptcy between how they favor wildfire victims, bondholders, and equity holders. Bond holders obviously want to get paid first, but gov't won't allow that if wildfire victims are left bag holding  


Equity holders have little voice and have been viewed as most likely to get screwed if they own common stock  


Most recently they were negotiating a large sum of pay out for the Tubbs fire wildfire victims with the expectation they would need to have a big trial in January to determine liabilities.  


I'd expected to be able to keep playing off volatility and selling puts through March because there was so much uncertainty but things have moved quickly since then  


They recently managed to reach a settlement on paying 13.5B to the wildfire victims as a mix of cash and shares. While the government is posturing and stating they aren't happy, it's ultimately posturing in my opinion (given the governor has had deep pockets with PCG lobbying him and funding his wive's films, plus he's one of the only political officials who has not actually returned this money in California despite being questioned about it, at least others had the thought to donate it to charity for fire victims if not returning it)  


If the judge approves this settlement it effectively sets an upper bound on wild fire liabilities for PCG and also means the january trial is eliminated. This removes a lot of uncertainty on the total amount of liabilities PCG will be dealing with and also means there is less dilution necessary since original forecasts had the total sum potentially exceeding 23-25B for wild fire victims (due to lawyers trying to wring them dry)  


I'll keep selling puts and making option premium but will likely put a small speculative sum in my 401k on PCG, there's a much better chance this thing can exit bankruptcy and return to it's previous highs of 24-40$ a share  


Note the long term risks remain of wildfires, but it does seem like reform on tactics to avoid fires are becoming a bigger priority with settlements including some measures to invest in preventative tactics (though realistically the company could never afford to make all it's exposed live wires across California go underground, the cost is easily 50-80B dollars estimated by them)",cpgupta561,1575740326,1,100,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e7h72m/pcg_growing_more_and_more_likely_to_exit/

Over the last month all the uber drivers have disappeared. It can take 10 minutes just to connect to a driver and everyone seems to be experiencing it. 

Word on the street is Uber May be trying to push drivers on to an hourly rate instead of fee per journey and they’ve all fucked off in my city.

$PLAY DD,"Dave &amp; Busty’s earnings are coming out this week.
 
From going once every month/2 months for the past year, The major change they’ve picked up business wise is ditching their usual coupons that are fed via email in favor of switching everything over to an app on your phone. Now the coupons used to be pretty sweet, the best being a buy $20 of tokens, get $20 free. If the managers are cool, you won’t even need to pay $20 at all, just get $20 worth of free tokens. Now that gravy train appears to have dried up as the only standing offer is “50% off your first purchase of tokens.”

Running out of tokens? Buy it from your phone, fuck the lines, do it instantly. Great for squeezing out an impulse purchase out of people.

I’d like to remind people that some of these games in these establishments are literal slot machines. And have you seen those kids fucking huddled around screaming their heads off about those massive fish-roulette wheels? Those games aren’t cheap, and when you do hit, hey! Congrats kiddo, those hard-earned tickets will go towards $1 worth of sugary candy and cheap chinese toys bought in batches of $10,000. People come to play and have fun and the people who actually want prizes at the end probably spend a good amount more than their prize is actually worth.

I don’t expect any massive fluctuations. We’ll see how the app-based implementation of their rewards program pans out, but they look as busy as ever - wonder if this will increase profitability based on the ability to reload cards instantly and the absence of their usual deluge of coupons.

Long $MCD for 2020,"I've been looking at buying $MCD as its currently trading significantly below its ATH of $220 at $195, and its a good company with strong fundamentals. The most recent dip is because of a firing of a CEO (he was banging his assistant or smtn like that, not a pedo or anything), and missing earnings. I'll try to ease fears about both of these things but first: why you should be optimistic. 

McDonald's is moving towards having less company owned stores and more franchises, which is the reason earnings was poor. However this is good for their ROIC (return on invest capital, i.e how what percentage of a dollar invested will return a profit), which has increased from 12% to 17% meaning if they follow this trend they can either maintain costs and increase revenue, decreased costs and maintain revenue, or what is harder but still plausible, increase costs and massively increase profits. 

They've invest a lot in AI to improve the user experience and adapt the menu as the customer moves through, all with the aim of getting them to spend more, which should result in greater profitability throughout 2020 as well.

The new CEO of McDonalds is very familiar with the company, and was in charge of their store redesign in the US which was a success. He's an industry veteran, and McDonalds already has a very clear and profitable path ahead. I expect nothing radical from the new leadership, it is still the same board and people around the C level.",BigBloodyShark,1575672516,1,43,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e75wa6/long_mcd_for_2020/

"CHK will not be going bankrupt, DD inside","Chesapeake Energy, an oil and natural gas producer, added a warning in their most recent 10Q of the possibility of breaching debt covenants in the short-term, which could bring their massive \~$10B pile of debt due, cause on run on their assets, and in all likelihood force the company into bankruptcy. When investors saw this in the 10Q they panicked and dumped the stock, sending it down more than 50% in a month after already dropping from a high of $3.40 this year and $26 in 2015, however, they're wrong.

Taken from the SEC's Financial Reporting Manual, this disclosure is required for one of two reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**9210.5** It may be necessary for the liquidity and capital resources discussion to address debt instruments, guarantees and related covenants. Disclosure is likely to be necessary if:

1. The registrant is, or is reasonably likely to be, in breach of debt covenants or
2. Debt covenants impact the registrant's ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing.

In my opinion, the only reason for the disclosure here is #2 as they're stretched too thin to accumulate more debt, especially as their existing financial covenants tighten. More on this below.

## The Trade

Long call spreads expiring Jan 2021 at the $0.50/$1.50 strike at a debit per contract of $0.23 (as of Dec 4).

**Upside** is roughly 4:1 on this trade, assuming CHK avoids bankruptcy, reduces fear of insolvency, and returns to a share price they maintained as recently as November 4th.

**Breakeven** is effectively at the current price.

**Downside** is the debit paid of $0.23 per contract if CHK is at or below $0.50 in Jan 2021.

## The Setup

Natural Gas and Oil prices have been historically low, putting substantial strain on a company already burdened with a mountain of debt. This has put pressure on CHK to make significant concessions in order to maintain its financial covenants.

Taken straight from the latest 10-Q:

&gt;*The Chesapeake revolving credit facility is subject to various financial and other covenants. The terms of the Chesapeake credit agreement include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. T****he Chesapeake credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain (i) a leverage ratio, which is the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX, each as defined in the Chesapeake credit agreement to exclude amounts associated with unrestricted subsidiaries, of not more than 5.50 to 1 through the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, which threshold decreases by 25 basis points each quarter until it reaches 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021 and every quarter thereafter, (ii) a secured leverage ratio of not more than 2.50 to 1.00 until the later of (x) the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021 or (y) the first fiscal quarter in which the Company’s leverage ratio does not exceed 4.00 to 1.00 and (iii) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2019; not less than 2.25 to 1.00 through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2020; and not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2020 and every quarter thereafter***\*.\*  
&gt;  
&gt;***As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants*** *under the credit agreement and we were able to borrow up to the full availability under the Chesapeake revolving credit facility and had $1.443 billion of borrowing capacity thereunder.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that may be economically produced. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.* ***If continued depressed prices persist, combined with the scheduled reductions in the leverage ratio covenant, our ability to comply with the leverage ratio covenant during the next 12 months will be adversely affected which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.*** *Failure to comply with this covenant, if not waived, would result in an event of default under our Chesapeake revolving credit facility, the potential acceleration of outstanding debt thereunder and the potential foreclosure on the collateral securing such debt, and could cause a cross-default under our other outstanding indebtedness.* ***We are actively pursuing with support from the Board of Directors a variety of transactions and cost-cutting measures, including but not limited to, reduction in corporate discretionary expenditures, refinancing transactions by us or our subsidiaries, capital exchange transactions, asset divestitures, reductions in capital expenditures by approximately 30% in 2020 and operational efficiencies.*** *We believe it is probable that these measures, as we continue to implement them, will enable us to comply with our leverage ratio covenant.*

These warnings have caused the stock to plummet, however from the management notes we are able to simply compare the current state versus those required by the covenants:

&gt;***Our total leverage ratio was approximately 3.88 to 1.00, our first lien secured leverage ratio was approximately 0.74 to 1.00 and our interest coverage ratio was approximately 3.55 to 1.00***

The present state is well within the covenants imposed by the Chesapeake credit agreement, both presently and as the covenants tighten, and the following outlines reasons to believe this will remain the case.

## In Support of the Trade

* Operating Expenses down YOY and QOQ, with further cuts coming along with a 30% reduction in capital expenditures for 2020 which would free up \~$600m based on the 2019 CapEx of $2.1b
* A large portion of losses are due to non-cash line items including a hefty depreciation/amortization charge, which can be deferred in the short term to pay off debts.
* They’ve shown that there is an appetite for some debt holders to be converted into equity
* Acquisition of Wildhorse in Feb 2019 gave a substantial boost to production. For this acquisition 717.4m shares were used (along with $381m cash) for a total acquisition price of $2.4b (plus $1.4b in debt assumed), yet those shares are now worth only \~$538m for an acquisition price today of $919m. Essentially, this was a steal.
* Only \~$300m senior notes due in 2020 and another \~$300m due 2021, with a total of $208m due in the next 12 months. This shouldn’t be overly difficult to manage in the short term, especially with a reduction in CapEx of \~$600m
* \~$1.5b available under the Chesapeake revolving credit facility (Due 2023), giving liquidity
* Fair value of the entirety of the long term debt, based on current market prices for each of the securities, is \~$2b (20%) less than the amount carried on the balance sheet
* CHK owns 22m shares of FTSI which can be sold as needed (though only worth \~$20m at present, as they’re also under stress). Again, this provides some liquidity if needed, particularly if counterparties start to require collateral
* Over \~$100m in severance paid due to mass layoffs this year, in particular as part of the Wildhorse acquisition, which is a non-recurring expense
* **Financial covenants are well within the requirements at present:**
   * **Leverage Ratio: 3.8:1.0 vs 4.5:1.0 required as of September 2020 and 4.0:1.0 required as of March 2021**
   * **Secured Leverage Ratio: 0.74:1.0 vs 2.5:1.0 required**
   * **Interest Coverage Ratio: 3.55:1.0 vs 2.5:1.0 required as of September 2020**
* Roughly 75% of planned production is hedged to reduce impact of lowered commodity prices and improved ability to predict upcoming financial situation:
   * Oil: 17 million barrels @ $59.28/barrel ($1.007b)
   * Gas: 265 billion cubic feet @ $2.76/mcf ($0.731b)
* This company has plenty of solid assets available to be sold off, as they’ve done in the past. It likely won’t be at prices that benefit long term shareholders, but it gives them options in paying down their debt.
* Further conversion of notes to equity could terminate tax loss carry forwards, which is one motivation (albeit small) to avoid dilution as a first resort
* The price of natural gas is already significantly suppressed which is limiting supply, so an improvement in demand could give a nice boost to prices

## Against the Trade

* $9.7b in debt versus limited or zero free cash flow and deteriorating commodity prices
* Current ratio of 0.6, with almost no cash. This is also exclusive of \~$100m in notes coming due late 2020
* Revenue and income down YOY and QOQ
* Tremendous interest expenses, and growing
* A number of ongoing lawsuits, though nothing which is overly concerning or significant to the trade
* Further conversion of notes to equity could terminate tax loss carry forwards, which have helped reduce expenses
* Most of the debt is secured, leaving virtually nothing for the common in the event of a liquidation
* Potential for further \~$350m to be required as collateral by counterparties, which could impact liquidity
* $92m in dividends payable per year on the preferred shares, not many converting to common
* The company’s future is very tightly coupled to the price of oil and natural gas, which I don’t have any particular expertise in.
* Further dilution is a very real possibility as more debt is converted to equity, especially at such reduced share prices driving the conversion rate against the common holders

## Developments

* **December 4th:** Offering to exchange $1.5-$2.34b in debt at 60-70 cents on the dollar to 2025 11% notes (essentially, kicking the can to buy some time)
* **December 4th:** Arranged a $1.5b loan over 4.5 years which is being used to buy $617m in 2025 notes issues by BLV (subsidiary) for 97 cents on the dollar, as well as expire the BLV revolving credit facility

**TLDR**: CHK is going to die a long and painful death, but it won't be in the short term, and they won't breach the covenants which have everyone shaking in their boots. Buy $0.50 LEAPs or $0.50/$1.50 call spreads.",stcopow,1575640464,1,0,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6z1nk/chk_will_not_be_going_bankrupt_dd_inside/
$CHK DD,"Chesapeake Energy, an oil and natural gas producer, added a warning in their most recent 10Q of the possibility of breaching debt covenants in the short-term, which could bring their massive \~$10B pile of debt due, cause on run on their assets, and in all likelihood force the company into bankruptcy. When investors saw this in the 10Q they panicked and dumped the stock, sending it down more than 50% in a month after already dropping from a high of $3.40 this year and $26 in 2015, however, they're wrong.

Taken from the SEC's Financial Reporting Manual, this disclosure is required for one of two reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**9210.5** It may be necessary for the liquidity and capital resources discussion to address debt instruments, guarantees and related covenants. Disclosure is likely to be necessary if:

1. The registrant is, or is reasonably likely to be, in breach of debt covenants or
2. Debt covenants impact the registrant's ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing.

In my opinion, the only reason for the disclosure here is #2 as they're stretched too thin to accumulate more debt, especially as their existing financial covenants tighten. More on this below.

## The Trade

Long call spreads expiring Jan 2021 at the $0.50/$1.50 strike at a debit per contract of $0.23 (as of Dec 4).

**Upside** is roughly 4:1 on this trade, assuming CHK avoids bankruptcy, reduces fear of insolvency, and returns to a share price they maintained as recently as November 4th.

**Breakeven** is effectively at the current price.

**Downside** is the debit paid of $0.23 per contract if CHK is at or below $0.50 in Jan 2021.

## The Setup

Natural Gas and Oil prices have been historically low, putting substantial strain on a company already burdened with a mountain of debt. This has put pressure on CHK to make significant concessions in order to maintain its financial covenants.

Taken straight from the latest 10-Q:

&gt;*The Chesapeake revolving credit facility is subject to various financial and other covenants. The terms of the Chesapeake credit agreement include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. T****he Chesapeake credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain (i) a leverage ratio, which is the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX, each as defined in the Chesapeake credit agreement to exclude amounts associated with unrestricted subsidiaries, of not more than 5.50 to 1 through the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, which threshold decreases by 25 basis points each quarter until it reaches 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021 and every quarter thereafter, (ii) a secured leverage ratio of not more than 2.50 to 1.00 until the later of (x) the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021 or (y) the first fiscal quarter in which the Company’s leverage ratio does not exceed 4.00 to 1.00 and (iii) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2019; not less than 2.25 to 1.00 through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2020; and not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2020 and every quarter thereafter***\*.\*  
&gt;  
&gt;***As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants*** *under the credit agreement and we were able to borrow up to the full availability under the Chesapeake revolving credit facility and had $1.443 billion of borrowing capacity thereunder.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that may be economically produced. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.* ***If continued depressed prices persist, combined with the scheduled reductions in the leverage ratio covenant, our ability to comply with the leverage ratio covenant during the next 12 months will be adversely affected which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.*** *Failure to comply with this covenant, if not waived, would result in an event of default under our Chesapeake revolving credit facility, the potential acceleration of outstanding debt thereunder and the potential foreclosure on the collateral securing such debt, and could cause a cross-default under our other outstanding indebtedness.* ***We are actively pursuing with support from the Board of Directors a variety of transactions and cost-cutting measures, including but not limited to, reduction in corporate discretionary expenditures, refinancing transactions by us or our subsidiaries, capital exchange transactions, asset divestitures, reductions in capital expenditures by approximately 30% in 2020 and operational efficiencies.*** *We believe it is probable that these measures, as we continue to implement them, will enable us to comply with our leverage ratio covenant.*

These warnings have caused the stock to plummet, however from the management notes we are able to simply compare the current state versus those required by the covenants:

&gt;***Our total leverage ratio was approximately 3.88 to 1.00, our first lien secured leverage ratio was approximately 0.74 to 1.00 and our interest coverage ratio was approximately 3.55 to 1.00***

The present state is well within the covenants imposed by the Chesapeake credit agreement, both presently and as the covenants tighten, and the following outlines reasons to believe this will remain the case.

## In Support of the Trade

* Operating Expenses down YOY and QOQ, with further cuts coming along with a 30% reduction in capital expenditures for 2020 which would free up \~$600m based on the 2019 CapEx of $2.1b
* A large portion of losses are due to non-cash line items including a hefty depreciation/amortization charge, which can be deferred in the short term to pay off debts.
* They’ve shown that there is an appetite for some debt holders to be converted into equity
* Acquisition of Wildhorse in Feb 2019 gave a substantial boost to production. For this acquisition 717.4m shares were used (along with $381m cash) for a total acquisition price of $2.4b (plus $1.4b in debt assumed), yet those shares are now worth only \~$538m for an acquisition price today of $919m. Essentially, this was a steal.
* Only \~$300m senior notes due in 2020 and another \~$300m due 2021, with a total of $208m due in the next 12 months. This shouldn’t be overly difficult to manage in the short term, especially with a reduction in CapEx of \~$600m
* \~$1.5b available under the Chesapeake revolving credit facility (Due 2023), giving liquidity
* Fair value of the entirety of the long term debt, based on current market prices for each of the securities, is \~$2b (20%) less than the amount carried on the balance sheet
* CHK owns 22m shares of FTSI which can be sold as needed (though only worth \~$20m at present, as they’re also under stress). Again, this provides some liquidity if needed, particularly if counterparties start to require collateral
* Over \~$100m in severance paid due to mass layoffs this year, in particular as part of the Wildhorse acquisition, which is a non-recurring expense
* **Financial covenants are well within the requirements at present:**
   * **Leverage Ratio: 3.8:1.0 vs 4.5:1.0 required as of September 2020 and 4.0:1.0 required as of March 2021**
   * **Secured Leverage Ratio: 0.74:1.0 vs 2.5:1.0 required**
   * **Interest Coverage Ratio: 3.55:1.0 vs 2.5:1.0 required as of September 2020**
* Roughly 75% of planned production is hedged to reduce impact of lowered commodity prices and improved ability to predict upcoming financial situation:
   * Oil: 17 million barrels @ $59.28/barrel ($1.007b)
   * Gas: 265 billion cubic feet @ $2.76/mcf ($0.731b)
* This company has plenty of solid assets available to be sold off, as they’ve done in the past. It likely won’t be at prices that benefit long term shareholders, but it gives them options in paying down their debt.
* Further conversion of notes to equity could terminate tax loss carry forwards, which is one motivation (albeit small) to avoid dilution as a first resort
* The price of natural gas is already significantly suppressed which is limiting supply, so an improvement in demand could give a nice boost to prices

## Against the Trade

* $9.7b in debt versus limited or zero free cash flow and deteriorating commodity prices
* Current ratio of 0.6, with almost no cash. This is also exclusive of \~$100m in notes coming due late 2020
* Revenue and income down YOY and QOQ
* Tremendous interest expenses, and growing
* A number of ongoing lawsuits, though nothing which is overly concerning or significant to the trade
* Further conversion of notes to equity could terminate tax loss carry forwards, which have helped reduce expenses
* Most of the debt is secured, leaving virtually nothing for the common in the event of a liquidation
* Potential for further \~$350m to be required as collateral by counterparties, which could impact liquidity
* $92m in dividends payable per year on the preferred shares, not many converting to common
* The company’s future is very tightly coupled to the price of oil and natural gas, which I don’t have any particular expertise in.
* Further dilution is a very real possibility as more debt is converted to equity, especially at such reduced share prices driving the conversion rate against the common holders

## Developments

* **December 4th:** Offering to exchange $1.5-$2.34b in debt at 60-70 cents on the dollar to 2025 11% notes (essentially, kicking the can to buy some time)
* **December 4th:** Arranged a $1.5b loan over 4.5 years which is being used to buy $617m in 2025 notes issues by BLV (subsidiary) for 97 cents on the dollar, as well as expire the BLV revolving credit facility

[DD] Netflix - Curtain Close,"Let's have a deep look at our favourite junk bond financed content creator - shall we?

What is - by far - the most important metric people will look at when **NFLX** opens their books on January 15 is subscriber growth - particulary in the US. Conveniently (for **NFLX)**, that is exactly the one thing investors won't be able to see, since **NFLX** changes its reporting structure. Formerly, **NFLX** reported its numbers as *DOMESTIC v INTERNATIONAL* \- in the future there will be five world regions. While on the one hand, there is indeed more transparency, on the other hand US numbers will need to be estimated. This is important, because the US numbers indicate what **NFLX** can achieve in mature markets. 

Anyway, here is my take on UCAN (USA + Canada) subscriber numbers: **They will decrease.** I do not claim that **NFLX** users will massively switch to Disney+ or other competitors. But they don't need to. The numbers will still be disastrous. **NFLX** has a churn rate of 9-10% per quarter (that is the amount of users unsubscribing). This is actually pretty good. The problem for **NFLX** lies in the new or re-subscriber numbers. Since there are competitors now, massively cheaper priced, **NFLX** will not be the first choice to subscribe to for people anymore. **DIS** has been acquiring licenses for movies and series for the past two years - and the main driver for users to decide for one service over the other is their collection of classic movies and series - not the new stuff. People want to rewatch stuff - and that is something they can hardly do on **NFLX** anymore. Also, **AMZN** or **DIS** or **AAPL** each have more to offer than ""just"" movies and series. They benefit from cross- and up-selling and are not 100% dependent on streaming revenues. Unlike **NFLX**.

""OK"", you might say, ""those are all assumptions"". True - but I've also got some numbers for you. Let's look at **CAC** \- **C**ustomer **A**cquisition **C**ost. These can be calculated by dividing gross added subscriptions by marketing spend. I've taken the numbers from the **NFLX** reports. I've assumed a churn rate of 9%. And - most importantly - I've added the **netCAC** \- which uses net added subscriptions. Numbers, apart from **CAC** and **netCAC** are in thousands. Table is for the US market.  


||Q1 2018|Q2 2018|Q3 2018|Q4 2018|Q1 2019|Q2 2019|Q3 2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Subscript.|55.087|55.959|56.957|58.486|60.229|60.103|60.620|
|Marketing|$250.719|$251.298|$210.595|$312.739|$221.046|$250.606|$211.793|
|Churn|4.958|5.036|5.126|5.264|5.421|5.409|5.456|
|Gross add|7.030|5.830|6.034|6.655|7.007|5.295|5.926|
|Net add|2.277|872|998|1.529|1.743|(126)|517|
|CAC|$35.66|$43.11|$34.90|$46.99|$31.55|$47.33|$35.74|
|netCAC|$110.11|$288.19|$211.02|$204.54|$126.82|($1988.94)|$409.66|

**NFLX** business is pretty seasonal. Usually, the first quarter is the most efficient while during summer people tend to subscribe less. While the **CAC** on a quarter-to-quarter basis only increased a little, you can see massive increases in **netCAC**. In Q2 2019 Netflix was unable to sustain their paid memberships - even without any additional competition. The reason was a price increase which led to an increased churn rate, which - quoting their Q3 2019 report - has not returned yet to its original value. 

Thanks to the new competitors, there is no reason at all why it should go down one bit. If anything, it will increase. If it stays at 9%, churn will be 5.456.000 lost subscriptions, at 10% 6.062.000 and at 12% 7.274.000. Now look at the gross add. In each of the quarters, gross add was less than in 2018. According to **NFLX** own forecast, we look at 61.220.000 paid subscriptions at the end of Q4, equal to 600.000 net add subscriptions. Considering Q4 2017 (1.465.000, not in table) and Q4 2018 (1.529.000) this is already pretty low. 

We also know that according to **NFLX** own reporting, marketing spend will be more weighted towards Q4 2019 this fiscal year. Let's just assume, in order to have a lower bound for our estimates, that it is just the same as in Q4 2018 - $312 million. This would mean **netCACs** of $512.23. That is a 150% increase over Q4 2018. And remember - that is the lower bound. Now we know that there are competitors, which will compete for the same ad placements, where their marketing is most efficient. Then, in general, marketing prices increase on the biggest platforms. Lastly, this extremely important quarter for **NFLX** coincides with Christmas, meaning even higher marketing cost. 

If we assume $400 million marketing spend in the US in Q4 2019 - which in my humble opinion should be quite realistic, if not still a little bit on the lower side, **netCAC** increases up to $666.67. Per user. Now what does a user bring in revenue? According to **NFLX** itself, Q4 2019 domestic revenue is expected to be $2.455 million - that is $24.93 per user. Divide **netCAC** by this figure, you'll end up with 26.7 quarters that a user needs to be subscribed to **NFLX** just to recoup his or her original marketing spend. At these marginal cost there is only one thing to conclude: **NFLX** cannot grow domestically in a sustainable way anymore. Even if we take the lower bound figure, it still takes more than 20 quarters for a user to break even. And that is only break even considering marketing. Which is a smooth transition to the next point: content.

By far the biggest drivers of cost for **NFLX** are content creation and license acquisition. In 2019 alone, **NFLX** is expected to spend more than $15 billion for content creation, up from $12 billion in 2018. This will be around 75% of its revenues. Add marketing, interest, technology... you won't be surprised that free cashflow is a whopping -$3.5 billion. Nice. General believe is that prices for production crews, sites and actors will increase due to higher competition - but most importantly only few of those produced content pieces will become hits. Will these suffice to keep the customer base happy? Or will they subscribe for a month, binge it, and unsubscribe again? **NFLX** library will be 80% rubbish (personal opinion here), while **DIS** with its vast archive of great movies just gets you to watch Star Wars for the 69th time. In order for **NFLX** to compete with a similarly big library, they will need to produce more and more and more, which means that they cannot uphold their notion to be able to finance content creation out of their own pockets. Which brings me elegantly to debt. 

More than $32 billion as of today. With 110 million subscribers globally, that is around $300 long-term debt per subscriber. Debt increased by nearly $7 billion from 2017 to 2018, and by another $7-8 billion from 2018 to 2019. Revenues grew by $4 billion and by $5 billion respectively. While revenues are recurring and debt is not, the question remains whether increasing interest payments will take a toll. Especially if the most profitable market stopped growing and investors see less upside in **NFLX**, interest rates for newly issued bonds will increase as well, exacerbating the cash flow situation. Interest expense in 2019 will easily exceed $600 million, that is more than 3% of revenues. 

So where does this leave **NFLX**? The domestic US market has stopped growing, but still requires new content to be created. Marketing spend is growing massively - only to **not lose** subscribers. Can **NFLX** increase prices? Not really. Churn rate already increased reportedly - and since users have competition to switch to, this will really hit them. 

**NFLX** debt increases and will continue to do so, since developing immature markets is expensive. Interest payments will have a higher impact. Competitors enter the market with more attractive pricing and a more attractive library. And deeper pockets. **AAPL**, **AMZN** and **DIS** have cash to spare - **NFLX** doesn't. The $150 billion market valuation is bound to collapse sooner rather than later. Especially since investors seem to move their money away from growth to value stocks.

So the question is not, whether **NFLX** will tank - but how much?",silvio_berlusponyy,1575635628,1,45,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6y6vt/dd_netflix_curtain_close/

$ABUS Potential Buyout," Today, I am presenting the official WSB lottery play. After calling $ARWR at $28 a STRONG buy I am going to be discussing my next big play. I believe that Arbutus Biopharma $ABUS will get bought out after their phase 1 trials in January-March. 

What is Abus? 

They are a one drug company that is focusing on the hepatitis B infection, a disease of the lvier caused by HBV. Worldwide, there are about 250million with hepatitis B infection and an estimated 1 million each year die from complications of HBV. This is a major market with lots of potential money. 

Why ABUS?

ABUS only has a market cap of around 126 million, extremely undervalued compared to the other 3 companies developing HBV drugs. Of the 4 HBV drugs in trials, 3 are partnered. ARWR has a licensing deal with Janssen receiving $250 million cash and up to $3.5B in milestones. Roche’s partnership with Dicerna paid $200 million upfront with up to $1.47B in milestones. Finally, ALNY received an undisclosed upfront payment with up to $1B in milestones. With these valuations we can assume ABUS will get a similar deal equivalent to around $8-$10 in reflecting share price. 

What are the catalysts?

ABUS is releasing their phase 1 trials sometime between January and March, around the same time all the other companies got partnered. Based off the previous data, a large investor holding over 2.4million shares has said that the data is looking better than ARWR’s.

The play

June 19, 2020 calls $5 strike price are only around 0.15 to 0.20. If the buyout occurs around $8.50 then a $750 investment will net $25,000.",Frostyfragzz,1575573776,1,60,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6m309/abus_potential_buyout/

10k dosage, insurance coverage because of lacking alternatives after PA for most plans, and a company that previously was in a 2.2billion kiddie pool market share has the potential to skyrocket with this thing come February.

RH... no not that RH... Restoration Hardware,"Ol' Home town Buffett inexplicably jumped into Restoration Hardware a quarter or two ago... and the thing has continue to moon.

CORV: December 24 PDUFA Date for Brinavess,"*Brinavess* might get approved by the FDA on Xmas Eve. It's been a while in the making, but given that the drug has been approved in Europe since 2010, it seems likely that the FDA will approve it. 

On 11 December 2007, the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted to recommend the approval of vernakalant, but in August 2008 the FDA judged that additional information was necessary for approval. The drug (under brand name Brinavess) was approved in Europe on 1 September 2010.

What do you think: Big Gainz? Or GUH?

Peloton is GARBAGE... DD inside,"this (the stock) is gonna flop. Peloton might be a cool new gimmick for the season but none of that will have becky's telling their husbands to invest in the stock..... what exactly would be the point of anyone investing in this stock? **Its not like Beyond Meat meme or TSLA where they are actually trying to change a huge industry with cutting edge bullshit.**

Peloton is just a bullshit recycled overpriced product using viral psychological marketing to make everyone talk about (THE PRODUCT)... and wall street will see this and just expect a nice blowjob from Karen when she gets off her overpriced bike with a stupid screen that will end up pissing her off on her period. theres nothing special about this stock. 

the hype is in the product... not the stock.  think like someone on wallstreet...  who the fuck thinks this is a good INVESTMENT...  its not.  its a maybe possibly cool new gimmick workout machine...  **there is NOTHING revolutionary about it, and there is no growth potential...  prove me wrong there if you can.**

BIIB DD,"Fellow autists, I had the pleasure of catching a Alzheimer’s segment on the local NBC station this evening. They had some doctor talking about the BIIB study that is set to come out tomorrow. Here are the key points:

- This is not a cure, rather it delays the symptoms long term, offering a higher quality of life

- The longer you’re on the medication, the stronger effect the drug has. This is why the studies were originally scrapped earlier this year. At first, the drug appears to have no impact, but after a while they did find some evidence of the drug working as intended

- If approved by the FDA, the hope is to have the drug available within the next year

- I also saw somewhere that the estimated additional revenue of an FDA approval is around $10 Billion annually

Use this info at your disposal. Hopefully, someday Autism will get the same kind of attention.

WSB ETF $TONKS (Return since inception),"u/TheGlennDavid finally put together an etf that includes all the dumb shit people talk about in this sub everyday.

[Here's a link to his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e60d4q/wsb_etf_tonks_a_look_at_what_you_talked_about/)

Since I'm bored as fuck and have access to m1 finance I figured I'd throw these tickers into a portfolio to see how well they've been doing.

Since inception the $TONKS ETF has returned 17.22%

Inception was May 10, 2019. *aka* the day $UBERs valuation cut in half. To be fair -50% is better than every one of your Robinhood all time graphs.

For reference, in this same period $SPY has returned 8.38%

Here's the math for those of you who can't read yet

&amp;#x200B;

|ETF|May 10th|December 3rd|Return|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$SPY|$285.62|$309.55|8.38%|
|$TONKS|$100|$117.22|17.22%|

&amp;#x200B;

It costs about 90k to create an ETF so if anyone here hasn't yolo'd that money into PTON calls yet, I'd park my retirement account in $TONKS for the memes.

You’re all wrong about Peloton,"Been seeing a lot of hate on PTON here lately. You’re all wrong.

Let’s start with the ad. People assume the ad is implying that the husband is somehow forcing this Becky to use the bike and get in shape. Not true at all. Why is it so inconceivable that maybe she actually wanted it? She continues to broadcast her entire experience with the bike on social media, which is typical Becky behavior and not scandalous in the least. And it doesn’t matter that she was not fat to begin with. That’s not the point. The goal here is to build mental strength, discipline, and Instagram followers, not lose weight. Now Peloton is getting bigly exposure, and in this case the saying “no bad press” actually applies. This all benefits the company.

One of the criticisms of Peloton is that it is expensive. This is not necessarily true. Beckys spend more money on coffee each month than the cost to finance this bike. Beckys all around the country are just now learning of something they didn’t know they wanted, and it is within their reach. 

It's not just about the bike, either. Peloton used to appeal to just hardcore cyclists, but it is going mainstream. The subscription service has literally thousands of on-demand classes on running, cardio, strength, yoga, meditation, even walking. I have been a subscriber for the past six months and I have never even thought about owning the bike. I planned to cancel after the free trial but the service is so damn good. The instructors are all surprisingly encouraging and motivating, and you feel like you are part of something bigger. I have taken other workout classes, but there is something special about the Peloton people and brand. By the way, they claim to have a retention rate of 95%. 

Now let’s talk about the stock.

No, it is not that expensive. Assuming they meet their sales estimates of 1.5B, the price to sales ratio is in the 7-8 range, which is in line with other tech companies like MSFT, AMZN, and NFLX. And yes, PTON is a tech company. 

Revenues are doubling every year, and this is before they have even reached the core Becky market. They have no long term debt. The CEO says they could be profitable now if they chose to slow down growth, and I actually believe him. They have no valid competitors. Yes, there are companies like Flywheel, Echelon, and SoulCycle, but they are all well behind Peloton and in no shape to become the frontrunner in this market. Go look at each of their websites and then look at Peloton’s website. You’ll see what I mean. 

2020 is going to be a massive year for Peloton. I predict sales will surge this Christmas and we will see that in their next earnings report. This is not WeWork. This is not a scam. I am holding calls.",miglas,1575489476,1,176,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e64twg/youre_all_wrong_about_peloton/

PTON update,"About 59% of the float is currently short with a borrow rate of about 7%. Stock came down from $37 to about $31.90 as of this update. I am still long. I haven’t taken any calls off the table. Ihor at S3 posted that he thinks a short squeeze could be on the table soon, but he said it’s just a feeling (follow him on Twitter- he’s bright). 

Whether you think the ad they put out was offensive or not, we can all agree it was stupid and probably didn’t help them win any more customers. I still expect a rise to the high $40’s or low $50’s and this down period doesn’t really negate my thesis as of yet. I just looked at my BYND chart as it ran up from $80 (when I bought calls and posted on WSB) to $240 and it had several serious drawdowns ($190 to $138, etc) on the way up. Just my two cents. My $35 strike calls expire Jan 17th. 

Ideally we should be seeing the amount of available shares to short falling at brokers. At IB it was 1.9m shares available a week ago, then 1.2m towards the end of last week, and I believe was 580k or so yesterday. Anyone have an updated figure on that from today?

3. Target. Honestly they have some cool stuff on sale but this year they dropped the ball. Not much more to say really. Target cyber Monday deals are very person specific so you either hate it or love it.

4. Amazon. This one is just disappointing. Honestly nothing good on sale. Walmart selling new games for $49 and Amazon has them full price. Basically the only things on sale are shit they wanna liquidate. So far it’s garbage. Apparently deals unlock as the day goes on so maybe this will invert but this one is really just the worst of the bunch imo. Like who wants a discount on a fucking Roomba and kitchen crap?

I went to the mall with my mom so you didn't have to. DD inside.,"Alright so I was home for thanksgiving, and my mom said I needed new clothes.  I told her I wouldn't go to the mall but then I thought about all the insider information I'd get from actually being inside stores so I said I'd go. 

First thing we see when we pull up to the Macy's at the mall, bunch of fucking garbage outside in their bushes.  Plastic bags, bottles, other shit, I was like mom what the fuck is Macy's on rn.  They got hella people inside, and not one poor fucker can go out and pull the shit off their bushes?  So we rolled through mad quick because there were just way too many red dresses and I'm a dude so like I'm not trying to be like that.  Short em, they're dying.

We head over to Tommy Hilfiger's.  Now idk if any of you have been unfortunate enough to walk into a TH store, but holy shit I have never seen an uglier collection of clothing.  There were like these sleeveless puffer vests that had these rainbow-plaid patterns all over that I have never seen a single soul wearing.  I actually stayed in Hilfiger's more than other stores because I was just in so much amazement at how ugly their shit was. Short the fuck out of em.

Anyway, tried Ralph Lauren, wasn't a 65 year old golf-bro so I left. They're so fucking boring, Iron Condor is the play.

Eventually I just walked past an American Eagle, saw a decent looking jacket, walked in, it was 60% off, bought it and left. Long AEO, profit margins may be tight tho.

Now I would make these plays before next earnings calls myself, but my RH has 28 cents left down from 1300 bucks so hopefully someone else can capitalize on this dd.

Tl;Dr: Short Macy's, Short Tommy Hilfiger's, Ralph Lauren is boring as fuck, Long AEO (but maybe don't).",johnyt3,1575242777,1,16,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4pstv/i_went_to_the_mall_with_my_mom_so_you_didnt_have/
I may or may not have some very valuable DD for Dollar General (DG),"So I work at DG, asked my boss questions on how the stores are doing. Apparently my store is doing top 100. And we only beat our expectation by like 15%. Everyone else is garbage from what she told me. And she works her ass off to keep the store to maximum profits, those that think every penny counts. Anyway DG is doing better overall for the year but nothing significant to show for. Earnings whisper suggests a cent over expected. Which is the “better overall” fact source. Thats what the bosses are told I guess. 

Anyway, I’m not too sure what guidance means but its not good apparently from what the nerds at investing say about mango man and whatnot. Cuz retail is bad rn? idfk

What I’m mainly looking at, is the fact that out of 15k stores, our store in the top 100 beat by 15% more or less.

So Puts ITM. I’ll throw 1k on it.

I’m 80% sure on this. But if I’m wrong and you lose money just remember that you listened to a random guy on the internet. On the other hand if you win bigly, remember that it was all thanks to a guy on the internet.

Sell $BYND,"Just got out of Burger King for some due diligence on $BYND.  I got the impossible whopper, the wife got the normal whopper. 

What I can say is that the normal whopper has more of a sleight sirloin/beef taste. (Go figure) Eating the impossible burger patty directly taste exactly like getting a Boca burger from the Walmart freezer. Both sandwiches were served near cold but what can you expect from the Fight for $15 crowd in central Washington. 

At double the price and no better taste $BYND is over hyped and I value the company at sub $15 a share. They provide no added value and at a 5 billion plus valuation you have to be hitting the market order button on this stock because you either have $85 left in margin or your Stafford loan proceeds just hit your RH account.

PTON short rates and Black Friday update,"For those of you looking for an update, I am still holding my Jan 2020 $35 calls. I haven’t sold any yet. It might be  a mistake, but I’m a big believer in letting your winners ride while cutting losses quickly.

The short interest as a % of float has come down tremendously to 59.9%, still incredibly high, but much lower than the 80%+ we were dealing with a few weeks ago. The borrow rate has stayed mostly the same at between 5-7%. Something interesting happened today, however: for the first time that I’ve seen, IB is reporting that they have no more shares in inventory to short. It could be a fluke, but if it is accurate, then the squeeze could be starting as the borrow rates go higher and shorts rush to the exits. 🤞 

Black Friday update: I stopped by a class A mall with my family and finally bought the peloton bike. It didn’t seem crazy busy to me, but the employees said it was the busiest day ever so far. When I tried to schedule a delivery date, the delivery times disappeared before I had a chance to confirm probably 4-5 times.  The delivery calendar is linked to PTON stores in the region (Philadelphia/Delaware/NJ area) so it should mean high demand. After clicking furiously on the dates and time I finally got a delivery date On the calendar for about 11 days from now. I’m hoping this means that sales are good and that data somehow leaks out into the press/analyst community over the next few weeks...

Uber DD,"Hello america! I am european!

Anyway last week i was in New York on the wallstreet. I wanted to take a pic with the charging bull but it was overwhelmed with asian tourists so I got mad and ordered an Uber. 

The fare was $84, fine for the distance I was doing. Then the day after the ""adjusted my fare"" and pulled another $16 (how is that even legal) without a god damn notification, first warning sign. Then I click on the receipt because I was curious as to the specification to the $16.62 specific amount. The  receipt said ONLY:  

In addition to other government-mandated taxes and fees, you'll also notice a new Congestion Surcharge on Manhattan trips below 96th St.  

First thing, that's unfair as fuck. They knew the initiary before I booked which their algos could calculate into the price they offered even before i booked it. Secondly, where the fuck is the detailing of the specific 16 bucks u just nicked from my man purse??? Just that drives me nuts.

I kept searching for a reasoning for a (to me) huge difference in final price, people were like fees, tolls, traffic but all those were baked in into the first fee i paid with the $84 fare. So I was really curious how they calculated it so I contested the change and demanded a detailing of the fees (IT WASN'T EVEN DETAILED ON THE GOD DAMN RECEIPT HOW ILLEGAL ISN'T THAT).

Anyway, 3 hours later i get an answer. Guess what? A refund for $18, without any form of specification on the error (this to me is the last final warning sign). 

And you ask me what are the warning signs leading up to? Well, that they do this intentionally. Unsuspecting customers or people that take this at face value: ""In addition to other government-mandated taxes and fees, you'll also notice a new Congestion Surcharge on Manhattan trips below 96th St."".

So this leads me to the numbers. They increased my fare by approx 20%. Say they use this technique on 1% of their users. And 30% of the users they pull this on suspect them and get refunded. This leads to the fact that their revenue is exaggerated by a crazy 0.001%. Knowing growth stocks are based on revenue growth that is unacceptable and I'm setting a price target at $0,2 per share.

Never bet against the Mouse,"Just some light dd reading for your holidays.

Disney released Disney+ and Frozen these past few weeks and the earnings that came with them reflected only the costs and the hype that came with the releases. 

The coming year will see major revenue growth from the streaming app and an increase in the streaming library size. Bringing many who haven’t yet bought Disney+ into the Disney fold.

Some support for the growing Disney brand is the park operation. I’m currently at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, FL and was at Universal Studio yesterday. Both parks (and I’m assuming EPCOT as well) are undergoing expansion/construction in their resort areas probably to accommodate an increase in park attendance. Not only this, but Disney has opened its newest theme park expansion Star Wars: Galaxies Edge which has yet to prove its profit generation. Coupled with Disney’s series The Mandalorian, the show will very likely drive up park attendance at the new theme park.

All in all, 2020 will prove to be a massive year for Disney’s parks and it’s streaming service. If you haven’t bought in a dip yet, do so before the next earnings because it will most definitely be big. If not, that will be due to construction costs at the parks and will be the centrally planned dip to make good earnings nonconsecutive and generate larger positive shifts in price.

"Anyone else following ITCI? My DD on this stock, would like some opinion from others","I had posted about ITCI before, but I never fully read all of the scientific info on the molecule of interest until today. So I ended up reading all of the articles in regards to Lumateperone's usage for treating schizophrenia. It seems like Lumateperone has a very good dopamine d2 receptor occupancy level (rivals that of Clozapine, one of the best anti-psychotic drugs on the market) and the 60 mg oral daily dose has shown efficacy in two of the three randomized phase 3 trials. After finishing up the phase 3 studies, the FDA canceled the Adcom on Lumateperone's candidacy for schizophrenia and simply asked the company for animal toxicology studies. As it turns out, the molecule has an impeccable safety profile (it was optimized by med chemists at BMS) and these animal tox studies further supported that. But because Wall Street is obsessed with how adcom meetings can lead to stocks running high, a cancellation of an adcom was a bad sign for them and the stock got punished. Since the molecule had subpar performance in the previous phase 3 studies for its efficacy for treating bipolar disorder, I think that people were simply tired of this stock and thought it wasnt gonna go anywhere. 

In my opinion, the FDA is very busy with packing all these meetings into its calendar and they realized that Lumateperone has an excellent safety profile and decided to simply ask for some supplemental information as opposed to having a whole meeting about the drug's safety. While the molecule did not show much efficacy in previous phase 3 studies, it seems like it actually has good performance against schizophrenia. Given that Karuna just got some great price boost from its phase 2 results, I think the market may react nicely to this potential approval. 

From an insider perspective, there hasnt been any recent insider selling. There's a director that has bought over 6 million dollars worth of shares recently, and ITCI has been hiring a lot recently. Most of the people that were hired started working at October of 2019, interestingly. All of those who were hired are in the business/sales/growth of the company, showing that the company is anticipating an approval and is trying to set up a platform for growing their product. 

There's quite a lot of short interest on this stock, and I believe that this is due to people thinking that this approval is gonna get disproved much like all the other previous approvals in regards to ITCI's Lumateperone. I have  calls on this, but to cover the premiums on them, I bought some puts on the off chance that the approval doesn't go through. Thus, my worst case scenario is that I won't lose any money, but if the drug does get approved, we might see a huge gain since market reacted quite nicely to Karuna recently. This is my DD on ITCI.

PTON short interest update,"Nasdaq updated their mid month short data from PTON and it was wildly different than what many firms, including S3 (one of my favorites) estimated. short interest is just 27.6m on Nasdaq for PTON, for a 61% percentage of float short.

Borrow rate is still just 5-7%. Almost nothing.

These fuckers could've saved that blonde haired rugby dude that had the run in with cat shit from *Trainspotting*.

Anyway, if that was sufficiently retarded, these Mustang people have possibly created the Cadillac of gene therapies for X-SCID, an X linked immunodeficiency that primarily affects males. These males could grow up to be our fellow autists if this treatment actually works and become mainstream.

Get #Long on $TWTR and hell #Short $SNAP,"Twitter is down 20% off Q3 earning.  

Snapchat is trading off its 200 day.

Twitter drop was due to a bug effecting the targeting effectiveness of their advertisements. Ad revenue is 90% of their business, so that's why investors freaked. This was a one time event that imo is an easy fix for the short-term. Read more here:  [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/twitter-stock-tumbles-20-after-company-says-advertising-bugs-weighing-on-earnings-2019-10-24](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/twitter-stock-tumbles-20-after-company-says-advertising-bugs-weighing-on-earnings-2019-10-24) 

$TWTR is actually profitable since 2018 and has 50% more monthly active users over $SNAP --- that by the way is at a market cap of 21B while twitter is at 23B.  So these two companies are basically worth the same to investors as it stands right now. 

If you ask me Twitter more strongly reflects a company like FB than it does Snapchat. And FB currently trades  at a P/e ratio around 31. Twitter's p/e is around half that at 14. 

I love using Snapchat but their business model is trash, everything they do gets copied by other platforms i/e Instagram stories. They're not a news outlet or a place to find information like twitter, monetizing off lens filters is a joke.

Either way there is going to be an impact on the ocean shipping industry. Import/exports waiting to be shipped gotta be getting front loaded in expectation of the outcome and we are getting close. So, either companies ship a fuckton when the deal goes through or ship a fuckton and pass the cost on to the consumer, since they still gotta make dem tendies.

My plan right now is to try to figure out who is been holding out on inventory restock and what shippers they use then try  to play some FDs like a ~~chump~~ champ off of that.

Another Hunch,"Anyone that has been following the HP XEROX shit show might have the same feelings as me. HP continues to flirt with a 20 dollar stock price and I think people are hesitant to buy in to the possibility that Xerox buys them out. I personally think this will 100% happen, Xerox is in hot pursuit and has HP is a pretty sticky situation.

My hunch is that HP will announce the acquisition of it's company on their ER on the 26th. I was thinking we might see a response this weekend, so there is still time, but I think they will go forward with it on ER day. 

In my opinion, this is an only win situation unless by for some absolutely ridiculous reason HP sticks to their guns and denies the bid. But I think there are two scenarios that will most likely occur. HP will miss on ER and announce the Xerox buyout, pretty much saving any shorts. OR HP beats ER and the stock pushes to 22-23 but there is still the issue of addressing the Xerox bid, they can't escape it, and according to Xerox, HP shareholders will benefit from the buyout, pushing the stock maybe even to 24-25 if they beat and they agree to the acquisition. 

Either way, I don't think HP will holdout, I think this thing gets announced this week and I think it's a definite win for call buyers. I've also been seeing much more OI and Volume leading up to this week in HP calls.

The Shatter Heard Round the World: Cybertruck and the future of TSLA,"Well if you love cringy shit, christmas came early last night. With all the confidence of a middle schooler that did his presentation the night before, Elon put on one of the more autistic performances in recent memory.  All I can think is someone on the design team saw that article from a few years ago when some guy turned his 7 year-old kid's drawings into stuffed animals, and thought he would be a shoo-in for dad of the year if he did the same thing with his 5 year-olds drawing of a car. 

However, the design isn't the biggest issue. The biggest issue was the window shatter. Why? The truck lost all credibility after that. Elon rants about windows being the equivalent to the doors of fort knox and some 110 pound virgin breaks them with a baseball. Didn't think to test that one backstage? So for the rest of the presentation Elon has to stumble over his words while standing in front of ""bulletproof"" windows that couldn't stop a half-assed throw from a guy who was cut from his kindergarten t-ball team. Then they put up the stats and the price. But guess what? NOBODY HAS ANY REASON TO BELIEVE ANY OF THAT SHIT IS TRUE. Think about it, if Elon was so confident about the window that he would risk a live demonstration, think about all the shit they didn't actually show. And don't even get me started on the glorified barbie car reveal at the end. 

Elon doesn't give a shit about making money, he just wants to be the Galileo of his century. As many have said, this was all for the preorders for an interest free loan. Why burn gas when you can burn cash instead? Earnings are headed back into the shitter. 

Only thing that can save this Aztec 2.0 pos is a military contract. But I don't see the US being too eager to put those ""bulletproof"" windows to the test over on Tatooine.",dandyguy69,1574439977,1,0,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e03a0t/the_shatter_heard_round_the_world_cybertruck_and/

"MSFT approved by Commerce Dept. to resume selling ""mass-market"" software to Huawei"," 

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) says it has been granted an exemption from a U.S. blacklist, and can resume selling ""mass- market"" software to Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co., Reuters reported Thursday ([https://www.reuters.com/](https://www.reuters.com/)article/us-microsoft-huawei/microsoft-granted-license-to-export-mass-market-software-to-huawei-idUSKBN1XV2LE). Reuters said Microsoft confirmed its approval for an export license in an email. The Commerce Department said Wednesday (http:// [www.marketwatch.com/story/us-has-started-approving-some-exemptions-to-huawei-blacklist-2019-11-20](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-has-started-approving-some-exemptions-to-huawei-blacklist-2019-11-20)) that it had started approving applications by almost 300 U.S. companies to export products that do not pose national-security risks to Huawei, though no specific companies were named. It is assumed that a number of major chip makers such as Intel Corp. (INTC), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) and Micron Technology Inc. (MU) applied for exemptions, hoping to resume lucrative business deals with Huawei. Reuters said Huawei is eagerly awaiting approval of Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, so it can access its Play Store for apps, but the Google had no comment Thursday as to its status.

This seems like it should push MSFT back above 150.

Hope this affects SPY tomorrow and other technology stock mentioned above.

When Herbert Powell let Homer design the Homer, Powell Motors went bankrupt immediately after the release when it realized that The Homer would cost $82k/car. Powell Motors was taken over by Kumatsu Motors during the liquidation. 

I don’t know if Elon recently discovered a half brother, but something as austere has certainly happened to explain why Tesla is passing off a pyramid in wheels as a pickup. Even with a price tag of $39,000, less than half of what The Homer sold for new in 1991, Tesla will still sell exactly zero of these enlarged rolling doorstops.

Cheap Short: Eagle Point Credit ($ECC),"I've discussed this short in a couple of threads but wanted to spell this out in detail for the benefit of the rest of you long-term bear chads:

Eagle Point Credit (NYSE: $ECC) is a closed-end investment company that invests 90%+ of its capital in the equity tranches of collateralized loan obligations (CLO). A CLO is a security made up of bundled leveraged loans, which are high-risk, dogshit-grade bank loans taken by companies otherwise shut out of access to corporate credit. The *equity tranches* of CLOs are those that receive higher promised payouts in exchange for being the first to take on defaults and losses when borrowers miss their payments. This fund has no meaningful diversification. In the case of a general downturn, defaults will inevitably rise, and investors like $ECC are first in line to suffer as a result. CCC-rated spreads are already rising, meaning that the appetite for buying more of these dogshit loans is starting to decline.

* $ECC is already down to 14.18 from its 2017 highs of 21.18.
* Only \~3% of the total float is short at the moment, meaning very cheap short interest. (No, there are no options for this stock, which hurts my heart every day.)
* $ECC was down -2.79% in October, and continues to [under-perform the S&amp;P](http://www.eaglepointcreditcompany.com/documents/FG/eaglepoint/ir/600566_ECC_Monthly_Portfolio_Update_October_2019.FINAL.pdf), making it unattractive even without a downturn.
* $ECC overstates its returns by [pointing to ""recurring cash flows""](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vf4E__HIpjgJ:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4298528-digging-ecc-performance-clo-equitys-true-return+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) of up to 20% when in reality its existing returns on some CLOs it holds are negative, others sit at a paltry \~4%.
* Leveraged loans are floating rate instruments, which means that they pay out less as central banks lower rates. Even junk bonds are more attractive in a declining rates environment, and they are often less risky.
* More generally, \~80% of leveraged loans are now covenant-lite, which means the value of the loans will be even lower than would typically be expected in the case of defaults, downgrades, and a general recession.

In a recession, all of Eagle Point's investments will simultaneously take losses as defaults skyrocket. It is literally first in line to eat this losses and pad the wallets of investors higher up in the CLO structure. The company has no portfolio diversification to protect itself. The value of its nominal assets ($500 mil) will crater, while its debt ($200 mil) will turn into a massive overhang. Bankruptcy is in the cards for this guy.

**tl;dr: Eagle Point is going bankrupt in the next recession, the stock is going to zero. If you're happy with a mere 100% return short this bad boy on the cheap.**",DaGhostOfMarx,1574367637,1,47,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzp8xm/cheap_short_eagle_point_credit_ecc/

A DD on Disney Sub Count,"As we know the Disney stock is beginning to move on sub count numbers in the same way as Netflix. So I prepared a short little DD using social media for you folks. Interpret it as you like

Netflix: 151 paid subscribers (158 total)

Twitter followers of 6.84 million results in a scalar of 22.076 (151/6.84)
Instagram followers 19 mil results in a scalar of 7.95 (151/19)

Apply the scalars to Disney plus results in:
784k Twitter * 22.076 = 17.3 million subs
1.6 mil insta * 7.95 = 12.2 million subs

There are obvious drawbacks to this analysis so poke holes. Personally I think it is closer to 17 million or more because 1) many people will not start following a twitter handle or page for quite some time after subscribing to a service and 2) I think the Twitter demographic is a closer representation of the Disney plus demographic. Just my thoughts.

$CUB looks like a sure thing.


They are in defense contracting and traffic management for cities.   Don’t ask me much more than that.   They have been expanding hugely, into international markets. 

Their stock price is up about 5% this year, unless you count it from the dip 10 months ago, then it’s up about 25%.

So they’re eps has sky rocketed.   Negative last year and now very profitable.  Their last quarter was up to .66 from .03 a year prior.  They are predicted to be at an eps Of $1.94 from .8 a year ago.  

The company predicts eps from $1.8 to 2.2 or so.   The low end is more than doubling last years eps.

In their conference call last year, in the Q&amp;A the ceo is asked how confident is he in this prediction and he said “confidence is very high” as it is all in backlog.  The deals have already been done. 

Their current p/e is around 77.  Q4 is where they make the majority of their profits so if they come anywhere close to prediction is will drop their p/e significantly and I’m hopeful the market will respond.

This has the potential to be a major fly in the ointment, a monkey in the wrench, for the trade talks.  Grand Pooh-Ba Xi has stressed how he doesn't want the US sticking their dicks into Gyna affairs as they look to crack down on Tiananmen Square 2.0 

If the House adopts the Senate bill and pushes it through with overwhelming support ( I don't see why they won't) and it lands on Dorito Mousillni's desk, he will be facing immense pressure to sign the bill.  Even if he decided to veto it, there would be a good chance Congress would override it based on its support in the Senate.  

I think Trumpdy wants to maintain his hardline stance against Gyna and this has potential to derail any trade talks (as if that weren't a forgone conclusion).  

Keep your puts in the toaster at any possible movement of this bill in the House.

Long PTON (BYND part deux),"Disclaimer: I am not making a recommendation to do anything. I am just writing about a potential short squeeze I see in the market and how I am currently positioned to take advantage IF that unlikely squeeze ever occurs. Do NOT follow me in this trade. I am not an analyst and I have no clue what I am doing. 

I recently bought Jan $35 calls in Peloton. To me, it has many of the same SHARE fundamentals that BYND had after this IPO. (Obviously not business similarities)

1. Relatively low float compared to shares outstanding (40m share float vs 280m total shares locked up until March.

2. Passionate user base that hypes the everloving shit out of the product and preaches how no other competitor is the same as them

3. Due to point 2, a “dumb money” retail base of investors that buy the stock because they like the product, ignoring valuations

4. On trend (subscription based, healthy, the “new” it product, etc)

5. Insanely overvalued- this is actually a positive because it has led to point 6

6. CRAZY high short interest as a percentage of the float. As of this morning it was 84%. Every “smart money” investor and trader is looking at this and saying “this POS is a fad and totally overvalued. I’m going to short it!” Just like BYND was at $80 when I first bought calls. It definitely WILL crash and burn and come back to earth at some point- but not before wiping out the shorts and causing a squeeze to a valuation deemed “ludicrous” 

I bought my calls on Monday for between $0.35-$1.00 I believe. 

I definitely might be wrong. In case there is someone out there that is willing to risk eating a box like last time, let me know soon!",MikeThePutz,1574266839,1,74,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dz4a13/long_pton_bynd_part_deux/

Walmart's next quarter will be explosive. Here's why. . .,"So yesterday, my younger brother sent me a Groupon link. As a good brother, I decided to click on the link to see dafaq that little twat had just sent me. What I saw next was unbelievable. He literally gave me a solid insights of how the next quarter of Walmart will look like. Basically, Groupon is selling  Sam's Club Membership for $30. (Regular Price $79.98). That wasn't it. The membership includes a free $30 gift card, and a complimentary household card. I was still skeptical about the whole thing. Then I started reading the next sentence. What I read next totally blew my mind. It includes a fucking free rotesserie chicken. :O I was sold at that point. Decided to check on some reviews of that coupon. It has 76k reviews. 1 review = one new Sam's Club member. So basically, Sam's club now has 76k new members added in this quarter. 
In the next earnings, they will brag about how Walmart is growing infinitely. Walmart's potential is unlimited. You all know how this works, right? Buy Walmart calls, it's free money. You are welcome. I have attached the link along with this post. Check it yourself.

I know what you are thinking, ""oh shit, I missed this huge bull run because I was buying FDs and losing $500/wk which is about twice what I can afford.""   


Sure, you fucked up.  But your life doesn't have to continue down that path. Here are two stocks, that \*oh yikes\* you might just have to buy common shares and hold it for 24 months. I know, I know, you want tendies next week. Well this isn't that kind of pla, but here you go:  


1) GPRO.  I'm quickly becoming the GoPro Stan of this sub. I'll die on that hill. This is a brilliant play for autistic gamblers. You can do anything with it: Fire on the $3.5 next week calls, buy the 4/20 $5 FDs, or just do the smart thing for once, and load up on common shares. You can max out that RH account on the common and not have to sweat every tick into expiration. This stock is turning around. This company is a world wide brand. They posted what could be the last losing quarter of the next 5 years, and the street hates them. This fucker tanked 15% without any news over the past few days and could go lower. But you have February earnings as your savior. Before you go looking at March calls, pull your head out of your ass and realize some rando on the internet could be 1 quarter off and you have to hold for 6 months to really see the turn around. But that shit is coming. Most can't see it because GPRO has been a negative stock meme for years. Jump in. This is your \~100% in 1 year kind of shit, which I know may not be good enough for the ravenous masses. Fine. Buy your $.35 11/29 calls and try to catch the bounce. See if I care. I'll be here with my steel hands.   


2) SPCE.  What? You didn't hear that Virgin Galactic went public? That's because they did it through Chamath's shenanigans Social Capital merger whatever. There was no roadshow. there was no hype. there was no 14 analysts with the 14 buy ratings when it came out. This shit will take a year or two, but when they start launching insta models into space in 2020, this shit will be fire. Who knows if it gets to cool space hotels and shit, but you best believe when you start seeing ""I'm the richest nigga in space lol"" Insta posts, it's too late. That shit runs to $100 /share before anyone looks at a balance sheet. Hype train, 1 year away.

Lowes ( LOW) ER Tomorrow - My DD/Prediction,"Earlier this year, Lowes put a restructuring plan into action that would serve as a foundation for them to challenge their rival, Home Depot.  Since then, they've been executing on that plan and executing it well.  In Q2 the plan began bearing fruit and, even with deflation of lumber prices and tariff concerns, they were able to do well enough to outpace Home Depot.  Their plan revolves around increasing their use of technology to modernize and streamline their supply chain to lower costs and improve profitability, while focusing on selling products and services to professionals.  The pros don't waste time buying a couple light bulbs or remodeling the living room... they buy the materials to build the whole house which increases per-ticket prices and provides a sustainable and dependable base.  In August, the home-building market hit 12-year highs and has continued to break new and higher ground.  You can also throw in the fact that the Fed has cut interest rates, which should also feed the housing mortgage market.  This all has put Lowes in a good position to release a good ER and good guidance going forward into 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

When they release their earnings report tomorrow morning before open, I believe they will beat the expected sales and earnings.  Since HD just reported earnings today, I am sure that analysts will compare the reports from the two companies.  As long as they report even decent numbers and decent guidance going forward, they will look incredible compared to how Home Depot shit the bed this morning and LOW stock price will jump up.

ARWR to the moon🌙,"Just an update for all those who missed my last post or want to know about how ARWR has been doing recently. Since then they have increased about 15% and options value have gained approximately 150-400% returns.

The good thing is this is still an absolute great buying point. They just released amazing data on their hypertriglyceridemia (APOC3) drug. It increased HDL-C (good cholesterol) by mean of 62% in the highest single dose. This is extremely impressive, here’s a link the the [data trials.](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/node/14976/pdf) this data is not priced in yet along with the rest of their pipeline. The company is a goldmine and will be getting drugs approved in coming years. 

Play long-term monthly options for best returns. For now, buy January to March calls and if you don’t mind leaving your money parked for a while I’d recommend 2022 calls.

Today Arwr is up big because a competitor co, MDCO, who has a deal with ALNY for a cardio vascular drug may get bought out by Novartis.

"Season 1: episode 2 | Undervalued stock pick, Church and Dwight $CHD (Zag when everyone Zigs)","Hi all, me again.

I would like to share the knowledge and experience I have gained by reporting on analysis of the stocks I pick as long-term buys. These shares are **value oriented which means that the price of the share is lower that what the company could be at based on the finances of the company**. I use free cash flow metric since having profitable steady cash flow is paramount to continued growth of the company. These valuations are calculated using the **conservative assumptions** leaning towards a grimmer outlook than what may be to hedge against the worst-case scenario. For example, in current calculations for the CPAM (capital asset pricing modeling) I am using a 9% return of the S&amp;P500 benchmark (as opposed to 10% overall or 24% for 2019), and for a return available on a “risk-free” investment is using a 10-year CD fixed rate of 2.5%). Although, also in works will be screening and analysis with a very conservative future S&amp;P500 return of 5%. I will also present 2 numbers – where 0 growth is projected in the future versus projected analysts reported growth. The former is if the company just were to stop growing and its worth today versus if it was still productive and continued to grow. Clearly, the 0 growth number is the bad scenario so if this is close to current valuation, then there is only room to go up (for most part, excluding unforeseen situations)

**Church and Dwight (CHD)**

household, personal care and specialty products.

[Church and Dwight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_%26_Dwight)

Price as on 11/18/2019 was 68 USD/share

1. Free cash flow 0.7 B
2. Shares outstanding 0.245 B
3. Cash per shares outstanding = 2.85
4. With a beta of 0.08, the risk adjusted discount rate is approx. 3%
5. Using Free Cash/share: With a 0-growth scenario the stock is worth 94$ ***(potential upside of 38%)*** with a analysts predicted 8% EPS growth over the next 3-5 years, ***stock is valued at 135$ (potential upside of 98%)***
6. Using earnings per share (EPS): With a 0-growth scenario the stock is worth ***80$ (potential upside of 17%)*** with a 5% EPS growth over the next 3-5 years and 1% growth after that, ***stock is valued at 115$ ( potential upside of 69%)***

Current P/E is 27 which suggests that investors expect higher earnings.   but there is scope for growth. This does not include the dividends that the stock will yield when it is held long term, current dividend yield is 1.34%.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**In conclusion, this stock is cheap at present and will increase anywhere from 17 to 98% in long term if things keep up!**

BABA will RISE!,"Baba will go well over 210 by year end (say thank you to HK!)

1) **HK listing and its pricing**

 a) The retail part of the offering offering (12.5 million shares plus another 50 million if needed) is set as the lower of the closing price this Tuesday in the US exchange or the set Maximum Public retail off price of $188HK (quick notes each HK share will be equal to 1/8th US Share). This means if current shareholders want to maximize their return for the November 26th offering they **need to run up the price to as close to $192 US Dollars tomorrow**, which would be equivalent to a 1/8 price of $24.10 or $188 HK dollars.

  b) The larger part of the offering is 487.5 million shares for institutional investors. This price may be set higher than the Maximum Public Retail Offer Price, which means as long as part A happens than this part will be purely based on demand. According to multiple articles **Alibaba was able to sell through all shares a day early**, closing their book tomorrow instead of the scheduled close of Wednesday.

2) **Chinese Numerology**\- if the price starts at $188HK it will jump $199 that Tuesday (26th) and hit $209+HK area by the 29th and $228HK by the 6th.

3) **Cashless World Order**. As China becomes a cashless society they will need to rethink red envelopes for the February Chinese New Year. What better way to wish someone a prosperous year then with a share of the ultra exclusive Alibaba share (this offering will make 1 share available per 100 people in China ) ....

4) **Singles Day.** Means JackShit to all of us, no matter how many articles we read about it the idea of a holiday with the combined profitability of Cyber Monday, Black Friday and Valentines Day....but the Chinese Get it, hell they live it

Abstract
Background: Impella® was approved for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in 2008, but large-scale, real-world data on its use are lacking. Our objective was to describe trends and variations in Impella® use, clinical outcomes and costs across US hospitals in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients treated with MCS (Impella® or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)).
Methods: From the Premier Healthcare Database, we analyzed 48,306 patients undergoing PCI with MCS at 432 hospitals between 1/2004-12/2016. Association analyses were performed at three levels: time-period, hospitals and patients. Hierarchical models with propensity adjustment were used for association analyses. We examined trends and variations in the proportion of Impella® use, and associated clinical outcomes (in-hospital mortality, bleeding requiring transfusion, acute kidney injury (AKI), stroke, length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs).
Results: Among PCI patients treated with MCS, 4,782 (9.9%) received Impella®; its use increased over time, reaching 31.9% of MCS in 2016. There was wide variation in Impella® use across hospitals (&gt; 5-fold variation). Specifically, among Impella® patients, there was wide variation in outcomes of bleeding (&gt; 2.5-fold variation), and death, AKI and stroke (all ~1.5-fold variation). Adverse outcomes and costs were higher in the Impella®-era (years 2008-2016) vs. the pre-Impella® era (years 2004-2007). Hospitals with higher Impella® use had higher rates of adverse outcomes and costs. After adjustment for the propensity score, and accounting for clustering of patients by hospitals, Impella® use was associated with death: OR 1.24 (95%CI 1.13–1.36); bleeding: OR 1.10 (95%CI 1.00–1.21); and stroke: OR 1.34 (95%CI 1.18–1.53), although a similar, non-significant result was observed for AKI: OR 1.08 (95%CI 1.00–1.17). Conclusions: Impella® use is rapidly increasing among PCI patients treated with MCS, with marked variability in its use and associated outcomes. Although unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out, when analyzed by time-periods, or at the hospital-level or the patient-level, Impella® use was associated with higher rates of adverse events and costs. More data are needed to define the appropriate role of MCS in patients undergoing PCI.

Cannabis stock may be going up today,"It's something I haven't heard nobody talk about in the last days,Wednesday a voting is going to be made in the US government to remove the federal law that makes cannabis illegal, it's going to be announced today according to the article, that is the only source I have found about the matter tho.
It doesn't matter if the thing gets approved since the trade is based on today's news. 
I know the federal legalization comes with a 5% tax on cannabis products but still, the market is going to gain a lot of customers so I think people will get that as a good news and buy cannabis stocks, maybe it's better to buy some index fund instead of specific stocks.

AMZN Puts (DD) (for real),"HEAR ME OUT  


The stock is a bubble. AMZN missed earnings last two quarters, attributed to one-day shipping costs. This is just a hand-wavy explanation by people who are blind to the real issues the company is facing:

* Amazon's size is a weakness, not a strength
* Costs are going up because the company is over-extended in it's growth pursuits and the infrastructure/workforce is inefficient
* As far as online retail, employee churn in the FCs is debilitating. From level one associates up to operations management, Amazon is struggling to attract and retain talent. Near me, FCs are paying $19/hour starting wage for season TIER ONE associates (temps) in preparation for their peak season, as well as offering existing employees a $500 referral bonus if they get someone to apply. (Subjectively, I'd wager nearly half of those new hires are gone within the first two weeks, meaning recruiting/training costs are sunk too)
* Amazon's reputation as an employer means it is attracting less and less competent management for roles in what is becoming a more and more complex global supply chain system. What's more, companies that grow like Amazon did eventually struggle with a transition from a culture that values singular, visionary leaders that practice independent, decisive problem solving, to a culture that is too bureaucratic, bloated, and ""committee-driven"" to unite behind any winning strategies. So when a business critical problem like ODS costs comes along, the beast is far too sluggish to react.
* Nike leaving was a consequence of the company's ineptness. Counterfeit goods are rampant; the website is becoming a flea market for Chinese garbage. Other big companies will begin to lose faith in Amazon. Even if they address this issue aggressively, it's just another factor that drives costs up.
* Whether you think there's going to be a recession or not, a lot of capital from funds and millionaires is going to be leaving the market, and Amazon is a favorite for these investors as a high-value, reliable blue-chip.
* Additionally, factor in market uncertainty from the Trump's impeachment, the trade war, the election. Both Trump and the Democratic candidates have talked about Amazon being too big, antitrust measures, etc. Politicians on both sides of the aisle HATE bezos and his fucking company.
* Way over-extended. Opened 3 FCs in the last year in my state alone, only to find no one wants to work in them? Leasing million square ft. buildings that are 50% empty space?
* AWS growth slowing. Still seems like a major money-maker except a company that trades 79 P/E and 15 P/B can't afford to stop growing. So much of the share price's value derives from the market's future expectations, so what happens when it becomes clear the company is hitting a wall? The price will correct to match more realistic expectations.
* Black Friday/Cyber Monday are later this year. This means Amazon has a contracted three-week period before xmas to deliver on absurd volumes WITH the added costs from one day-shipping.  


My prediction: Amazon misses earnings for a third time in Q4, finally clueing investors in that the company is not a resilient as it seemed. Growth slows because the company is too big to sustain it. The uncertainty of it's opportunities is overwhelmed by the certainty of it's threats.

The Complete Streaming Wars Synopsis.,"Welcome autists, gather round as I tell the tale of the most misunderstood conflict in modern media.

While Disney+ has been creating a lot of noise and sparking momentum for Disney stock, the streaming wars as it stands now, is being misunderstood by the vast majority of you. This post is in an effort to save you from losing money in the streaming services industry, so that you may lose it more autistically in Semiconductors and microchips.  Before we get into it, lets take a look at who the players are in the space. As a forward, I do not have positions in any companies mentioned as this is not my area of expertise. You may be asking, why are you posing if you don't know the streaming services space? Well, because its WSBs, and apparently none of you understand it either cause I haven't seen any real DD on it. I have posted current company cash balances for each one mentioned as this is an incredibly cash intensive business (excluding Roku perhaps)

&amp;#x200B;

**NFLX**

Net Cash *Deficit*: - 8 Billion

Netflix is a giant in the streaming industry, but trades at an extremely high multiple of \~93x P/E currently. Its biggest strengths are its experience in streaming services, it’s already developed customer base, it’s investments and developments into streaming specific infrastructure and most importantly, it’s development of home-grown content in foreign countries. Netflix and other streaming services are competing for very different customer bases outside of the US, in that it is one of the only streaming services that develops content for its local user base whether that be US based, In India, or somewhere in the EU. As emerging markets continue to grow Netflix is best poised to produce original content that is geographically/culturally specific and relevant. 

&amp;#x200B;

**AAPL**

Net Cash Balance: 98 Billion

Apple is a relatively new contender in the streaming space. Its biggest strength is its overwhelmingly healthy balance sheet, and its devoted user base of apple services and products. Apple will be best suited to pay practically any price it chooses to develop content or acquire it from third parties. Apple products and services are also widespread in many parts of eastern Asia and are gaining traction throughout other markets. Much remains “Up in the air” so to speak as far as what will be Apples final product in the streaming space. While most of the companies current value comes from Iphone sales at about 42%, future forecasts show that services including streaming is a must to maintain Apples growth.

&amp;#x200B;

**AMZN**

Net cash balance: 18 Billion

Amazon has continually struggled to develop their streaming services and as such has begun to shift it’s attention into many other parts of its core business. Amazons web services is by far the most critical part of its business followed secondly by its consumer discretionary / retail space. Amazon is not well positioned to continue the dragging battle that is the streaming wars as it simply doesn’t represent any significant revenue income. Although this may sound similar to Apple, at least Apple plans on developing their streaming services to reach a large portion of their revenue as Iphone sales continue to contract, where as amazon has a lack luster plan to develop its current streaming platforms. Simply put, Amazons could flat out stop streaming services entirely and the company  (and consumers IMO) wouldn't even notice.

&amp;#x200B;

**DIS**

Net Cash *Deficit*: 44 Billion

Disney has been a streaming service in a sense for a long time, so it is somewhat puzzling to me that they haven’t developed a direct to consumer streaming platform already. Overall Cable and its place in the world is quickly fading, even in developing and emerging markets as is generally far more cost efficient to stream rather than cable for consumers. It is for this reason that Disney is forced to cannibalize its own revenues in from cable rights in order to offer streaming now. Overtime, this means a much lesser improvement to balance sheet performance as their new Disney+ streaming service is essentially their replacement / solution to the upcoming losses from the disappearance of cable.

&amp;#x200B;

**ROKU**

Net cash Balance: 388 Million

Roku is an add supported business and the ultimate winner in the streaming space. As more and more streaming platforms and content offerings become available, Rokus value becomes more and more apparent to consumers. Rokus biggest hurdles are its current unprofitability, and its lacking cash balance, which it needs to continue development.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary (All highly opinionated of course):

Disney+ may be the stellar service that investors believe it is, but its success is needed, not optional, thus making Disney far less appetizing. Additionally, its user base will be almost exclusively US based which is by far the most crowded streaming space. Most of the growth in streaming services across the board comes from emerging markets and foreign market penetration. Disney opening its own streaming platform is a must to maintain the company’s relevance. Additionally, Netflix, although incredibly overvalued will ultimately be the only company to continually develop user growth in emerging markets apart from locally grown services, the only exception to this may be Apple. Apple may be able to develop outside of US markets in areas where they have high user counts, unfortunately, these markets are also being subject to quite a bit of economic uncertainty and external forces. Finally, Roku is the only clear cut and dry winner in this space. Roku is pioneering the field it’s currently in. Roku is much like the shovel salesman at the entrance to the gold mine, the only difference is, each time the gold mine entrance moves farther west Roku has already paved the road to beat the miners to it.  
 

In any case, the overvaluation of Disney will be corrected and Roku will continue to grow its path to profitability as more and more streaming services are offered. Disney plus, Apple TV and many others are not a “Netflix” killer given the different consumer bases and objectives of the companies and Amazon will most likely begin to quietly back out of the streaming space over the years, not grow their stake in it.

Breaking down of the Nov-15 retail sales numbers,"So yesterday the U.S. Census Bureau released estimates on the monthly retail sales. Sales increase by 0.3% and meet expectations. However, the increase is mainly from motor vehicle purchases and higher gasoline prices. Retail sales exclude car/gas/foods increase only by 0.1%, miss the 0.4% expectation. 

Since quite a few retailers are going through earning next week, it's good to have a rundown on the specific numbers in each category, which are also available in the report (table 2):

[https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts\_current.pdf](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf)

Some notes:

\- Furniture &amp; home furniture stores sales:    -0.9% (last month +0.7%)

\- Electronics &amp; appliance stores:   -0.4%   (last month +0.1%)

\- Building material &amp; supplies dealers:    -0.5%    (last month -1.8%)

\- Clothing &amp; clothing accessories  stores:   -1.0% (last month:  + 0.3%)

\- Health &amp; personal care stores: flat

\- Department stores:   +0.1%    (last month -1.5%)

\- Grocery stores:     +0.4%   (last month -0.6%)

\- Wait, if most categories are down, why do retail sales exclude car/gas/foods increase? That's right. There's a 0.9% increase in \*nonstore retailers\*, whatever that means.  

In general, the bounce people expected in sales did not really happen where it matters. Except car-mart maybe, but who's playing that? Not me.

AT&amp;T to the Moon in 2020/2021? DD,"$T is a good play for long term (18 to 24 months). At the very least dividends from their stocks could entice my Grandpa to invest in it. 

While their recent interactions with Elliot Management have been perceived as troublesome and a “win” for their activist agenda they own less than 3% of shares outstanding and more or less have an immaterial effect on decisions made by the board. Great they have 1 fucking board seat now. They exit of the CEO was something that Elliot more than likely knew before hand and they are wanting to use this moment  as a PR stunt to show off their “prowess.”

In general AT&amp;T has been declining in price due to a misread analysis from factors like Elliot or their current debt levels; but the market has yet to fully price in the effectiveness of their strategies to spin off divisions not integral to the firm’s profitability, competitive strategies and general market power.

While they have sky high amounts of debt from the acquisition of Warner media they have been steadily paying it off and 2020 should see a drastic decrease in their overall debt levels, according to their internal reports and press releases.

While their new challenge is a duo from both $DIS and the $S and $TMUS merger AT&amp;T has at least addressed the first issue they face with Disney: user cyclicality which is to say when GoT was running they saw a bump in subscriptions however once it ended they saw a net loss. They are however countering this with new shows set to run immediately after  block busters like GoT (I.e. GoT to Succession to Silicon Valley).

As for the merger AT&amp;T already has dominate market share and provides an all in one package between cell, land, cable and internet. While this strategy is likely to change it will only emphasize their programs such as out in California to build 5G networks for the state (literally being paid to build a massive network with bandwidth and wavelengths that rival that of AM/FM and current first responder equipment. It can pass through concrete better than current routes). The caveat to this project being first responders get priority of traffic on these airwaves in times of emergency (basically getting paid to have a PR boost with one of the first 5G networks in the US). So if an emergency happened like the wildfires they would face short term risk from mouth breathers unfamiliar with their business model or the tech; would not see the kind of effects like $PGE.

With all this being said I’m a big believer in their slight pivots being made as they are not acts of desperation nor competitive actions for competitions sake (*coughs* APPLE TV+ *coughs*).

Would say that calls for January 2021 or Q4 2020 could be solid plays despite their costs to enter into those contracts.

"First Time Doing DD, Let Me Know How I Did","I dont have a ton of capital invested yet, so I look at smaller stocks, but Barnes and Noble (BNED) is starting to reach it's current zenith.

Shitty AMD DD [$40 hard cap then down to ?],"The past few weeks AMD has been on a rise 25% in a month. That is insane, but it isn't AMD's first rodeo with a bubble. In about this same time a year ago we saw AMD do the same shit.

AMD needs time and a fair share price to grow as a company in the long term.

"Buy puts on ACB, expect another 10-15% drop next two weeks","Take my DD with a grain of salt, I rarely touch weed stocks but recently saw this and made a play and did some DD reading up on near term catalysts that may drag this dead overvalued cat down further. I also have been having issues cross referencing where they mean CAD vs USD so feel free to correct me  


So not only did they have the worst trading day they've ever had in five years apparently (down 15+%) after they had a horrible earnings report that had widening losses, shrinking revenue, and a strong indication of lowered guidance as they basically killed all expansion, they have attempted to try to clear up upcoming debt in the sum of 230MM$C as part of march 2020 debentures (ie convertible debt) by offering a discount to convert immediately, get all interest owed between now and the expiration in March, along with a snazzy 6% discount  


They are giving a window of time between Monday and Wednesday evening next week for people to step forward to have their debt converted and have already guaranteed to get a group with 155MM worth of their debt to commit to this.  


That means there is an additional \~80M worth of debt that may end up deciding to actually take the deal (I'm not an expert but if you thought this company could go bankrupt, getting your debt converted early to shares and the interest up front seems like a good deal to take to take your money and run)  


Even just with 155M worth of debt, this is approx 115M in USD which is 4.5% of float shares given current market cap is 2.58B  


That's 4.5% of equity dilution guaranteed, with a potential additional 2.3% share dilution occurring (this will be announced 11/22 after hours). This dilution can be even higher if the stock price keeps going down through Wednesday several percent  


You can also bet that this 4-7% worth of float that has been diluted is going to get liquidated fast given the share price is in a downtrend (I haven't seen any mention of a lockup preventing this)  


Given that 4-7% of float is 40-70M shares, thats 4x average volume that will flood in sell orders. I think there are still people who want to BTFD but even then I doubt this thing will get filled at a great price deal and will drag this thing down below 2$  


So we could see a 10-15% drop again, in addition to whatever standard bleeding we see occurring next week from this overvalued sector correcting finally.   


Also note, it sounds like just to keep FCF going ACB will need to keep selling equity (they sold 25M shares this half it seems) which will dilute equity further  


There's a chance the opening up of vaping market in several weeks could make this thing go back up, but I'm not sure there is evidence that even ACB expects it to make a material difference in near term.

Inside the president’s shift from a grand bargain with China to a small deal. (BBG),"Like I said in my previous posts, one thing that /r/wsb failed to grasp, is Trump's shift from ""all-in deal or nothing"" to ""phased mini-deals"". The long article below walks you through the history of the trade war, although I probably shouldn't be posting it, as fucking morons who are short over last two months lack the ability to read and comprehend more than a couple of simple sentences at a time. I probably already used up their capacity with this little intro.

&amp;#x200B;

**August was the game changer when they decided that they need to take it easy on China or risk panic:**

&gt;Fears of an economic slowdown in the U.S. that coalesced in August also changed the equation. Publicly, Trump’s advisers point to historic lows in unemployment and modest inflation to bat back concerns. They blame the Federal Reserve and a strong dollar for growth [well below](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-29/u-s-second-quarter-growth-revised-down-to-2-pace-from-2-1) the 3% to 4% Trump once promised. (The U.S. grew at an annual rate of 1.9% in the third quarter.) But the angst that the trade war may be exacting a greater-than-anticipated economic toll is thinly veiled.

**Business leaders intervened in August after the ""hereby order"" tweet:**

&gt;Then, on Aug. 23, the president directed U.S. businesses to explore ways of getting out of China. “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME,” he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1164914960046133249).  
&gt;  
&gt;Markets tumbled, and panicked chief executive officers and donors demanded to have a word with the president. Among them were Blackstone’s [Stephen Schwarzman](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1404170) and Las Vegas Sands CEO [Sheldon Adelson](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1918161), according to people close to the negotiations who asked not to be identified because the calls were private. **They say the interventions succeeded. From that moment on, Trump was in deescalation and dealmaking mode.** 

**Navarro little crazy madlad vs pump-it Kudlow:**

&gt;To extract concessions from China, the self-proclaimed “[Tariff Man](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1069970500535902208)” would have to roll back some duties put in place over the summer—a move some of his advisers, including Peter Navarro, the White House’s [most strident China hawk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-05-02/trump-s-trade-warrior-is-the-most-unpopular-economist-in-the-class), oppose. In a Nov. 8 email to reporters, Navarro blamed “propagandists within the Chinese government” for inciting stories that a withdrawal of tariffs might be nigh. He and Kudlow, who says tariff “[concessions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-07/china-says-it-agreed-with-u-s-to-roll-back-tariffs-in-phases)” are needed to close the deal, have sparred openly.  
&gt;  
&gt;The two men’s battle echoes divides that have existed inside the administration since the beginning. On Oct. 11, shortly before Trump sat down with China’s top negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, in a televised Oval Office meeting to announce a “substantial phase one deal,” Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with the president so he could sign off on the step-by-step approach. This, they argued, was a way to pocket some wins, take the pressure off the U.S. economy, and have another crack at the tricky issues in a second stage. Only one member of the team disagreed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Navarro, who was present, appeared intent on sabotaging the plan and, according to one person with knowledge of what transpired, interrupted the two cabinet members so forcefully that Trump eventually turned to him and said: “Peter, calm down!”**

**Pump-it Kudlow explaining why this approach is gonna pump the markets:**

&gt;Kudlow argues that a phase one deal will reduce the uncertainty hanging over the U.S. economy while starting to address important elements of the rivalry with China. “It’s a big win for the president. Because his tough negotiating style and his use of tariffs—both of which have come under great criticism—are paying off.”

# How Trump’s Trade War Went From Method to Madness

 

It started with a carefully calibrated trade weapon, an algorithm that spat out a list of targets for an assault on China ordered up by a U.S. president determined to rebalance the relationship between the world’s two biggest economies. The goal: building leverage for negotiations aimed at forcing wholesale changes in China’s economic architecture while limiting the pain to businesses and consumers at home. “We’ve given this an enormous amount of thought,” Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, [told senators](https://archive.org/details/CSPAN3_20180322_140200_Presidents_Trade_Negotiator_on_Steel__Aluminum_Tariffs) in March 2018, highlighting the work of the computer model his team had constructed. “It’s a sensible, moderate, appropriate amount,” he went on, “and it is calculated and created in a very businesslike, sensible way.”

The algorithm produced a [28-page list](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/List%201.pdf) of Chinese-made products, including aircraft tires, pacemakers, and printed circuit boards, whose total value—$34 billion—matched an estimate of the annual cost to U.S. businesses of Chinese intellectual-property theft and forced technology transfers. The more than 800 items on the list were selected for their potential to inflict pain on industries Beijing has designated as strategically important while taking into account the potential disruption to U.S. supply chains. Adding to the complexity, the task was to throttle back China’s imports without American consumers taking notice or endangering President [Donald Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1252249)’s promised [economic boom](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-31/trump-boasts-on-economy-undercut-by-weak-middle-class-pay-gains).

The model, though, didn’t account for the unpredictability of Trump. Behind closed doors, the president took the modest number—equal to 7% of the $505 billion in goods the U.S. imported from China in 2017—almost as an affront. He didn’t want moderate or appropriate. He grumbled to aides the figure was too low and demanded it be rounded up to at least $50 billion. Trump also asked his staff, almost as an aside: “Do you think I should put tariffs on everything from China?”

Twenty months later, what began as method now looks more and more like madness. A tit-for-tat tariff war has ensnared more than 70% of bilateral trade in goods and raised the specter of a decoupling of two economies that once seemed destined to become [progressively more intertwined](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-13/nobody-benefits-from-a-u-s-china-trade-war-with-no-end-in-sight). If the countries can’t resolve at least some of their differences in the coming weeks, the White House will on Dec. 15 add [15% punitive tariffs ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/trade-war-latest-trump-china-no-deal-fallout)on a further $160 billion in Chinese imports, delivering on what were once just presidential ruminations. That tariff round could jeopardize America’s record-long expansion, according to some economists. As it stands, the existing duties will knock 0.8% off [global growth in 2020](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-10-24/the-u-s-will-likely-avoid-recession-in-2020-here-s-why), according to recent forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.

The disruptions of an all-out trade war may yet be averted: Trump and China’s president, Xi Jinping, appear intent on reaching at least a partial truce by mid-December. In a Nov. 12 speech, Trump again signaled he would refrain from a new tariff assault if Beijing agrees to a “[phase one](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-11-13/-phase-1-deal-doesn-t-get-rid-of-policy-uncertainty-aberdeen-standard-investments-s-mccann-video)” deal that hinges largely on it stepping up U.S. agricultural purchases to as much as $50 billion within two years, more than twice the level before the conflict, and curtailing intellectual-property theft. Trump sees it as the start of a more comprehensive agreement. But Chinese officials quietly say they see any future successful phases as unlikely and that commodity purchases will at first simply be at the level they were before the Trump tariffs. Skeptics in the Trump administration also question whether Beijing is willing to close a larger transformative deal with a president running for reelection amid a [slowing economy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-01/u-s-economy-s-slowdown-spurs-concern-it-s-nearing-stall-speed).

Politicians and businesses across the board agree Trump was right to take on China. At the same time, the issues being tackled in a first phase of the trade deal are much narrower than the ambitious goals the White House once set for itself. There’s little doubt the fight will have a place in history, says Douglas Irwin, an economic historian at Dartmouth: No American president in the past century has waged an economic war on this scale. But while Trump created an opportunity, he risks squandering it as well.

“Are we going to look back and say, ‘This was all a failure’? I don’t think so,” says Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who leads the [Asia Society](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/80070MF:US) Policy Institute. “But if we end up comparing what they’re able to accomplish vs. their initial objectives, I think their accomplishments are going to fall way short. And they won’t be the first administration to do that. But wow, they certainly raised the stakes and certainly allowed U.S. interests to suffer through the tariffs in this effort.”

### ● Oval Office Scuffles

The picture that emerges from dozens of interviews over the past year with officials and other people close to negotiations is one in which one man’s impetuousness has confounded attempts at strategy. It’s the story of a president caught between his instincts as a dealmaker, his place in history, and a contentious band of aides, some of whom goad him into more radical action and others who tease him into restraint.

“That’s very Nixonian!” intoned Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, as the president and his aides huddled in the Oval Office in August to debate an intervention to weaken the dollar. The strong greenback is an [obsession for Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-08/trump-says-not-thrilled-by-strong-dollar-and-urges-fed-rate-cut), who believes it undermines his tariffs. Three months on, the invocation has different connotations as Trump faces possible impeachment. But back then it was a code between two seventysomething men for avoiding an economic mistake—an allusion to Richard Nixon’s August 1971 decision to [end the dollar’s convertibility to gold](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-08-04/the-nixon-shock). That move led to years of turmoil in markets and the stagflation of the 1970s.

Well into September, Trump said he would [never settle for a partial deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-09-20/trump-says-he-wants-a-complete-trade-deal-with-china-video) with China; it had to be the grand slam. Yet behind the scenes, his advisers were starting to discuss how to negotiate a stage-by-stage agreement and harvest elements that both sides had already largely concurred on, including a pact to avoid competitive currency devaluations hashed out in February when the Chinese team was in Washington.

To extract concessions from China, the self-proclaimed “[Tariff Man](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1069970500535902208)” would have to roll back some duties put in place over the summer—a move some of his advisers, including Peter Navarro, the White House’s [most strident China hawk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-05-02/trump-s-trade-warrior-is-the-most-unpopular-economist-in-the-class), oppose. In a Nov. 8 email to reporters, Navarro blamed “propagandists within the Chinese government” for inciting stories that a withdrawal of tariffs might be nigh. He and Kudlow, who says tariff “[concessions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-07/china-says-it-agreed-with-u-s-to-roll-back-tariffs-in-phases)” are needed to close the deal, have sparred openly.

The two men’s battle echoes divides that have existed inside the administration since the beginning. On Oct. 11, shortly before Trump sat down with China’s top negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, in a televised Oval Office meeting to announce a “substantial phase one deal,” Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with the president so he could sign off on the step-by-step approach. This, they argued, was a way to pocket some wins, take the pressure off the U.S. economy, and have another crack at the tricky issues in a second stage. Only one member of the team disagreed.

Navarro, who was present, appeared intent on sabotaging the plan and, according to one person with knowledge of what transpired, interrupted the two cabinet members so forcefully that Trump eventually turned to him and said: “Peter, calm down!” Asked about the incident, Navarro said he is “always a passionate defender of the president’s deep understanding of the situation with China and his practical solutions. But I don’t comment on private meetings with the president. What happens in the Oval should stay in the Oval.”

Within an hour of that exchange, Liu and his team arrived at the White House to finalize the truce. The discussion before the cameras arrived seemed inconclusive to some attending and left them confused, though Trump would minutes later praise a “lovefest” in U.S.-China relations to reporters. In the days that followed, Trump insisted that the teams were making progress and that he and Xi would likely sign the deal at a Nov. 16-17 gathering of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Santiago. That summit was [canceled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-30/trump-xi-trade-meeting-in-doubt-after-chile-cancels-apec-summit) after anti-government protests broke out in Chile, and a new venue and date haven’t been decided. In the meantime, the two countries are still negotiating exactly what each side will concede in a phase one deal.

### ● Are We There Yet?

The events of the past few weeks fit a pattern of false dawns in the trade war. At least three other times a pact seemed within reach, only to collapse in a back-and-forth of recriminations. One of the key moments came in May, when miscalculations by both sides blew up an expansive deal that had taken months to put together. Within days, Trump threatened new tariffs and placed Chinese telecommunications gear maker [Huawei Technologies Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/40978Z:CH) on a U.S. Department of Commerce [blacklist](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-10616.pdf), restricting its ability to buy hardware, software, and services from American high-tech suppliers.

The Huawei decision cast a shadow on a late June encounter between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, where the Chinese president asked his U.S. counterpart to ease pressure on the company and—according to Trump—promised to immediately buy “a tremendous amount” of American agricultural products. Trump agreed and returned from Osaka optimistic that a deal was in sight. But by the time U.S. negotiators returned from a round of follow-up talks in Shanghai in late July, the mood was souring. “That is the problem with China, they just don’t come through,” read one in a barrage of Trump [tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156159999833513984) on July 30, in which he complained that Beijing hadn’t lived up to its promise to restart agricultural purchases.

That set up one of the most volatile months of the trade war, feeding [recession](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/the-real-threat-to-trump-s-presidency-is-recession) fears in the U.S. as signs of a slowdown in manufacturing continued to build, [particularly in key presidential election battleground states](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-09-09/a-manufacturing-recession-could-cost-trump-a-second-term). In early August, Trump announced a major escalation—tariffs covering the remaining $300 billion in China imports that would start to take effect Sept. 1. At his behest, the Treasury Department officially labeled China a [currency manipulator](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-05/u-s-treasury-department-labels-china-a-currency-manipulator). Then, on Aug. 23, the president directed U.S. businesses to explore ways of getting out of China. “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME,” he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1164914960046133249).

Markets tumbled, and panicked chief executive officers and donors demanded to have a word with the president. Among them were Blackstone’s [Stephen Schwarzman](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1404170) and Las Vegas Sands CEO [Sheldon Adelson](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1918161), according to people close to the negotiations who asked not to be identified because the calls were private. They say the interventions succeeded. From that moment on, Trump was in deescalation and dealmaking mode.

Fears of an economic slowdown in the U.S. that coalesced in August also changed the equation. Publicly, Trump’s advisers point to historic lows in unemployment and modest inflation to bat back concerns. They blame the Federal Reserve and a strong dollar for growth [well below](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-29/u-s-second-quarter-growth-revised-down-to-2-pace-from-2-1) the 3% to 4% Trump once promised. (The U.S. grew at an annual rate of 1.9% in the third quarter.) But the angst that the trade war may be exacting a greater-than-anticipated economic toll is thinly veiled.

Worries about the economy burnished the attractiveness of a phase one deal that puts on hold new tariffs that would directly hit U.S. consumers. A partial pact would also reward American farmers for [standing with Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-19/farmers-say-trump-s-28-billion-bailout-isn-t-a-solution), despite being cut off from one of their most important markets. According to people familiar with the negotiations, missing from the partial deal are measures to address a key U.S. concern: how China often forces foreign companies to hand over technology. There’s also nothing related to the vast web of subsidies China uses to help its companies compete internationally—an issue Beijing is unlikely to budge on.

### ● From Grand Bargain to Minideal

Despite the diminished expectations, Trump and his allies are quick to defend his handling of the trade war. American supply chains have started shifting away from China, they say, pointing to [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US) and other companies’ [shifting of production](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-11/hon-hai-has-enough-ex-china-capacity-to-make-u-s-bound-products) to such places as India and Vietnam. And they are elated that Trump will also leave in place tariffs on a large portion of Chinese imports as an enforcement tool to ensure Beijing lives up to its side of the bargain.

Kudlow argues that a phase one deal will reduce the uncertainty hanging over the U.S. economy while starting to address important elements of the rivalry with China. “It’s a big win for the president. Because his tough negotiating style and his use of tariffs—both of which have come under great criticism—are paying off.”

Even Navarro touts the strategy in public. “The great deal President Trump seeks for America, China, and the world is the deal Ambassador Lighthizer negotiated in May 2019 but China reneged on,” he says. That agreement would have addressed what he calls China’s seven “deadly structural sins,” including its industrial subsidies and its dumping of low-cost products in the U.S. He also argues Trump, “as a master negotiator,” will ensure further phases happen. “Of course I support the president in pursuing this strategy because it helps the American economy and American farmers, ranchers, and workers.”

Critics, on the other hand, point to a U.S. trade deficit that’s on track to end 2019 some $150 billion larger than at the end of 2016, on the eve of Trump taking office. And they argue that the tariffs and export restrictions his administration has put in place have, if anything, reinforced Beijing’s determination to outpace the U.S. in critical areas such as [artificial intelligence](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-21/china-artificial-intelligence-plan-seeks-59-billion-industry) and biomedicine.

Trump’s phase one deal, if it happens, “will not alter China’s ambitions,” says Charlene Barshefsky, who negotiated China’s entry into the [World Trade Organization](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0600603D:SW) under President Bill Clinton. Rather than using protectionism and industrial policy to give American businesses a leg up, the U.S. should be investing in education, research, and infrastructure to boost its own competitive position. “We’ll never out-China China,” she says. “And if you spent 10 minutes in the country, you’d know that.”

Democrats looking to challenge Trump in 2020 will likely portray a phase one deal as caving. Yet, for better or worse, he has embedded the view of a malign China in Washington. Candidates from former Vice President Joe Biden to Senator Elizabeth Warren agree the U.S. has to [take on Beijing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-09-13/joe-biden-organize-the-world-to-take-on-china-on-trade-video), though they [find fault](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-29/elizabeth-warren-breaks-with-trump-in-new-trade-policy-plan) in Trump’s tactics. Notably, none of the front-runners have committed to removing tariffs on China.

A U.S. business community that wants both a short-term end to the uncertainty and longer-term fundamental changes in China’s economic governance is also wondering if it was all worth it. “What we all need now is a trade truce,” says Myron Brilliant, who heads the international division at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Whether the fight will prove worth it “will depend on what comes next.”

Many China experts argue Trump’s approach was too improvised and forced allies into a “you’re either with us or against us” equation that is divorced from the economic and business realities they face. “We’re in a political era of simple solutions at a time when these really require complicated and coordinated actions,” says Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese leadership politics at the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/139702MF:US), a Washington think tank.

Irwin, the Dartmouth professor, says an historical reference point is the War of 1812—which the U.S. waged against an England that was by far its largest trading partner and a predatory one to boot. One slogan touted at the beginning of that conflict, he says, was “on to Canada!”—a promise to annex new territories.

$TSM is free money,"I was sitting in my Semiconductor Physics grad class the other day and the professor was talking about the semiconductor fabrication process. He said Taiwan Semiconductor atleast 10 times during this lecture so I decided to look around on this stock. It just so happens I work in IC design as well and I know a decent amount about IC fabrication facilities, and they all have crazy high profit margins. This company is trade war agnostic, it is publicly playing both sides as it provides fabrication for companies in China and the US and neither side really cares. 

Now there’s a lot of talks about Apple beginning to make proprietary CPUs which will most likely be made by TSMC no matter how much Tim Apple says he loves America because all American fabrication houses suck.

Slack tendies - Uber crash v2,"Alright so I always complain about never hearing about the big plays until it’s way too late and the tendies have already been had. I blame this on two things, people not sharing actual good DD and being retarded. 

So I bring before you the opportunity to short Slack (WORK) for the same reason a lot of you shorted Uber a week back. These two companies have a lot in common, mostly by hemorrhaging money and being a being guided by the same Adam Neumann leadership style of “pretend you know what you’re doing”. 

Now just like Uber, Slack has earnings coming up and their expiration for lockup in the same 2 week span (earnings 12/4, expiration 12/17). Just like Uber they’re not profitable and are seeing lots of insider selling (half a billion worth in fact). Now the news cycle has yet to start reporting heavily on this like they did with Uber a week before these same events came up for them (they ended up falling &gt;15% in a couple days). I played their fall for a sweet 300% and plan to do the same for Slack. I’m currently holding my entire portfolio in 12/20 Put @ $18. 

Full Disclosure: while I did make up 300% on Uber being a dumpster fire I am still down 40% on the all time. Also I am retarded.

Alright boys here’s your shitty Walmart DD,"This is Lowkey going to be shitty DD but it wouldn’t be WSB if it wasn’t. Alright so I’ve spoken to 4 Delivery drivers(3 UPS 1 Fedex) they all agree that they have been seeing a massive influx of blue boxes from Walmart. Walmart is eating amazons lunch in my opinion. Amazon even indirectly, in my opinion, highlighted this during their last quarter earnings report. First off Walmart has next day shipping that not only, allegedly, costs them less to ship but is supposedly faster than amazons. It is also free for orders of a certain value. Walmart has been price matching and price beating amazon. I’m a Lego reseller and I can confirm that Walmart and target both have been crushing amazon in pricing. Those few dollars make a difference to business owners. In my opinion Walmart is positioning itself to be amazon but with actual physical stores which would one up them because they would appeal more to the lower income communities who cannot afford to ship their products or who simply are not on a FedEx/ups route. Walmart also has a borderline fascist form of food delivery that will allow Walmart employees to literally enter your home and stock your fridge but nonetheless less, people have been very positive about their grocery delivery, great thing about Walmart is they have a more direct consumer selection for groceries, everything in the store can also be shipped, allowing shoppers to see items first in person before deciding to buy. The strength of Walmart earnings is going to be based on its delivery service. Wall Street wants to see them compete directly with amazon.

$ARWR will be the next top pharmaceutical company,"ARWR is a pharmaceutical company that silences genes which create diseases in humans. They are a platform company meaning all their technology can be used for multiple diseases in all tissues including liver, kidney, lungs, and muscles. They currently have over 300 million in cash and two partnerships with top five pharmaceutical companies (Amgen and Johnson and Johnson) showing validation of their platform. Arrowhead's TRIM platform currently has an exceptional safety record - no serious adverse effects reported in any of their 7 trials within their entire TRIM pipeline. Adding to that, long term toxicity studies have been completed. This upcoming year ARWR will have 3 drugs in phase 3 trials, which is the last stage before becoming approved by the FDA.
They also just released great data on their hepatitis B drug which can be seen [here](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/static-files/6d7edbe7-c5a2-46c5-9990-a9cdfec854a9). They are one of the fastest growing stocks of 2019 and they’re not stopping here. Many investors are giving this a price target of $60-$100 by the end of 2020.
How to make money:
ARWR has shown exceptional growth in consecutive months and they have so many upcoming catalysts to keep them moving. There are so many things upcoming like investor meetings, partnerships, trials data, and even FDA approvals that will help them continue to grow at an unforeseen rate.

* Rapid roll out from email list to live site personalized recommendations signals that this is a very successful strategy, both in emails and on the live site (although certainly the live site personalizations would have a bigger effect I think)
* investors have yet to receive actual figures on how this has improved click through rates, conversion rates, upselling, etc.

I've done some scouting on their Wayfair page, which has about 80 reviews for this fiscal period. Assuming 5-10% of customers leave a review, which is extremely high, this represents between 800-1600 sales on Wayfair at an average price in the mid-100s (I calculated ~$520).

PFE Opportunity,"Hey,

I've been following ABBV, BMY, and PFE, and hold all in my IRA.

Earlier in the year, both ABBV and BMY announced acquisitions and then the stocks went down. Afterward they went up again, while also paying strong dividends. PFE recently had some business thingy with mylan that made their stock go down, but it hasn't gone back up again yet. (see below charts)

ABBV

[ABBV - 5.67 Dividend](https://preview.redd.it/vtfm1pag7lx31.jpg?width=1209&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=618a9e4af5facdbafac55a498b6cc5ec7aba07b2)

I think that PFE is the next opportunity to take advantage of this pattern. (Green line added by me as projection of possible growth)

[PFE 3.9&amp;#37; Dividend](https://preview.redd.it/nv2njk3z7lx31.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf4938ec3bd012c60232553eaa3e5878af95c220)

A rise to the stock price of $47 would give PFE a 3% dividend, which is still good. This would also make my  calls worth 15K!

The other thing is that the PFE Calls are really cheap, even distantly out of the money, for example the march 20 $41 calls are now 0.26 each. (it seems I bought too early, and have a 61% loss at this time, but will catch up). I will keep adding more PFE calls in the upcoming weeks as I cash out of other positions.

"[Next Level Autists Only] Recursive Leverage, Part 2: The Digital Boogaloo!","Okay, so it appears that RH has closed the infinite money cheat code leaving WSBers looking for the next big thing. I think I may have just the thing, but it’s going to take a special breed to pull this one-off. Why? It involves digital assets (cryptocurrencies) and leverage. How much leverage? Well, that’s up to your personal risk tolerance, but as usual a penny saved is worth two in the bush, so more is better (I think?).

In order to understand the leverage possibilities, I’ll give a quick lesson on the necessary information so try to keep up.

**CRYPTOCURRENCIES**

It’s like when you look at your bank account online or at an ATM, it’s just a number, literally money people made up. \[Remember, it’s not currency until you exchange it for cash\]. Until then it’s cryptocurrency. We need to get our hands on some of that sweet, sweet crypto.

Like normal cash, cryptocurrencies come in a variety of types and some are worth more than others, but at the end of the day it’s just some made up some. Which one do we need for our plan? Ethereum.

**ETHEREUM**

Ethereum is pretty neat. It was made by some Canadian-Russian super genius, Vitalik Buterin. Basically he was apart of the Bitcoin community, then had some great ideas and the bitcoin people were like “Cool, brah”... and Vitalik was like “I’m not your brah, dude” so he left and told some rich people about his idea and they gave him money to make it. In exchange for the money, he gave them some Ethereum (ETH) which is digital money he made up. You can get your hands on ETH at a bunch of places online, there are so many tutorials existing.

Anyways, this ETH stuff makes cool nerd things happen online and one of those things that came from it is a project called MakerDAO. This project is important as it provides the backbone for our leverage. I better explain the project.

**MAKERDAO** 

MakerDAO is a smart contract running on the Ethereum network. Basically think of MakerDAO like a central bank that issues currency, but on a gold standard type basis… meaning they only mint currency when it’s backed by something else, like money was in the US long ago. Only thing is MakerDAO doesn’t use gold as the backing for its currency (since you can’t shove gold into the digital world...yet), it uses ETH.

Still with me? Here’s a recap. You buy some ETH with USD/CAD (whatever flavour you use) from one of many online sellers. You then take that ETH and basically send it to the digital MakerDAO vault. Once the ETH is locked in the vault, you can create a new currency called DAI, which is something MakerDAO came out with that is supposed to be equal to $1 USD. So basically you look your money in the vault, talk to the online bookie and take back out DAI. How much DAI? Well, you can be collateralized to 150%, but below that you get automatically penalized (I’m not explaining this system to you basic level autists). So basically, if you locked 1 ETH into the vault and if ETH was worth $100 USD you could pull out $66USD worth of DAI.

What to do with the DAI though? Well, it’s accepted at many crypto exchanges at/close to the pegged $1 USD value so you could go exchange it for more ETH and do it all over again.

**WHAT NOW?**

Well, hopefully, you bought your ETH when the price was down (sideways market right now?) and locked it into the contract, pulled out some DAI, and did that again, and again until it just didn’t seem worth it. Well congratulations, you basically opened a long position on ETH. The great thing is that you still own the ETH you’ve locked in the vault, so if it goes up in value to say $150, technically you can now borrow $99 DAI ($33 more as you already took out $66) so why not go buy more ETH and do it all over again?

I hope people have an idea of where I’m thinking on this. Now keep this in mind.

**DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS AND RH FREE MONEY CHEAT**

There are some differences here between the money cheats.

1. You need to lock actual collateral in to start this whole thing. You can get lots of leverage, but need to start with something.
2. You’re attempting to bet long on a market that sees some pretty large swings, so you may not want to have as crazy a risk tolerance as a normal market.
3. This requires some level of digital competence; based on many of your posts, most don’t apply and you should have stopped reading long ago.
4. There is an interest rate for borrowing DAI on your ETH. It’s voted on and changed by a bunch of nerds that control the MakerDAO system. (Disclosure: I hold tokens that can vote, although have never done so because democracy).

If I’ve got your attention still and you think, can this actually work? Well, I did a little experiment using our Lord and Saviour, Google Sheets. It’s something I worked on a while ago and honestly forgot about as the market was in a position for something like this to be deployed for various reasons (bear market, DAI issuance ceiling, DAI liquidity), but progress has been made! Also MakerDAO is switching from one vault to another, which will have slightly different rules so this spreadsheet will be old idea more than current simulator.

I call the whole recursive loop on the MakerDAO system a Multi-Collaterized Debt Position (MCDP) or Multi-Level Collaterized Debt Position, but that's just my spin.

Beyond Meat Ipo explained (Gone Sexual),"Beyond meat is you pulling out a dildo- a nice, strapless model, with skin-like silicon- but your mom isn't vegan and was expecting real beef.  

Then, she and her girlfriends go sailing and manage to get themselves marooned on a desert island.  Now there's a bunch of horny women stranded with no males, so the low float causes demand for the dildo to go way up.  Some of the women have this thing where they hate on dildo's and say they can only get off on the real thing, so they sell their rights to time with the dildo in exchange for coconuts, which have become the de facto currency. 

After a few weeks though, the dildo snobs can't take it anymore and they get so horny that they're begging the others to fuck them silly with the strapless dick.  They need it so bad, that, in exchange, they're ready to pay wayyyy more coconuts than they got. They're just desperate at this point, having watched their friends strapping on and fucking each other so hard that nearby whales started to swim up to the beach to see what was up with all the loud moaning noises.

Then they get rescued by a passing yacht and the coconuts-to-dildo valuation bubble deflates so fast that the dildo ends up getting left behind on the island when they leave.

Ruining a Public Company or Collecting Free Money - WSB Decides the Fate of $PKD," **TLDR at Bottom.** So this company Parker Drilling ($PKD) decided that they want to ""go dark"" (in simple terms, they want to be private but don't have $$). In order to do that they're planning a series of stock splits to force out the poverts who own &lt;100 shares. But for the plan to work, there need to be no more than 300 shareholders after the stock splits.

The stock will be reverse split 100-to-1 so anyone with 99 shares or less gets a cash payment while anyone with 100+ shares stays in the company. There will be a forward split back after that so people with 100+ shares won't notice the change. Did I mention that the shareholders with &lt;100 shares are getting bought out at a 50% premium to today's closing price?

So now all you autists are left with a choice: buy 100 shares for \~$2k and likely ruin their plans to go private (only takes about 250 of us out of 700,000) or collect free tendies by buying &lt;100\* shares and being bought out at a 50% premium?

Supporting links for proof below. \*note that the stock split will be somewhere between 5 and 100 shares so guaranteed payout (provided they don't cancel their plans) is if you buy 4 shares, otherwise you risk they do the deal at a split level below your share count and you own part of the private company -- unlikely given this post and the subreddit's desire to ruin a public company

Anyone still following Geron ($GERN)?,"I know some of you were on the hook for the apocalypse last year, when J&amp;J discontinued the partnership and the stock cratered from a run up of ~$7 to $1. But things are looking better! Geron has their first in class cancer drug (Imetelstat) back under full control and are making progress toward FDA approval. Stock price has been hovering in the $1.40-1.55 range lately. 

One designation for the drug was recently given fast track designation by the FDA, and they have a meeting in Q1 2020 to discuss paths to approval. Their other designation just began dosing patients in a phase 3 trial, with results expected in 2022.

I bring it up now because they have an earnings report after AH tomorrow, which will be meaningless, but then a conference call in the morning. Apparently this is around the time they tend to announce research abstracts to be presented at the American Society for Hematology conference. There’s also lots of speculation that they’ll get another partnership to help them bring the drug to commercialization - or possibly a buyout. 

This seems like it would be a hit on WSB, land of the YOLO, since a bet in Geron is either going to turn to 0 or easily go to 10-20x. You can look at Celgene’s revenue with Jakafi to get some objective sense of the upside here. Imetelstat looks like it could be a qualitatively better treatment in than it doesn’t just address symptoms but actually changes the nature of the cancer. If anyone with a medical background out there has dived into the research data, I’d love to hear your take.

I think it's time we get together and shift the culture that we have created at WSB of idolizing YOLO's to something that benefits us all. So lets start here:

CMG:

Technical analysis: If CMG manages to stay below 750, the technical indicate that the stock is on it's way to 710. If momentum keeps up we may see sub 700. The stock is overvalued and market is correcting this. My calculations show the intrinsic value is $608/share (but every stock is inflated so I don't expect it to fall to that price point)

Customer Analysis: rising competition in the food industry has effect this stock with supplement items. I don't see as many people waiting in line as I used to see, and the quality isn't the same that it used to be.

Business Analysis: Shift to a retain customers using app is a genuine idea that many corporations are using to keep customers coming. But the cost of running the app, running promotions eats the bottom line. 

Feel free to share your insight/experience on this analysis, but from where this stands I see CMG falling. If this stays below 750 tomorrow I will pick up puts.",HN1995,1573001201,14,31,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds8imb/cmg_analysis/
The future of FUN - or why you should buy calls on Cedar Fair.,"You've probably been to a Cedar Fair park before - Kings Island, Cedar Point, Carowinds, maybe even Knotts Berry Farm. The company is currently beating the pants off of their two main competitors: Seaworld and Six Flags. They recently bought two schlitterbahn parks and are planning massive expansion with California's Great America, buying all of the land the park resides on. The previous quarter, the park beat the shit out of earnings, and Haunt season just ended, which will give amazing revenue numbers, jumping Earnings Per Share. I'm expecting the stock to go to $60 and jump even higher, as the company gradually takes over territory from Six Flags. Let's be real people, six flags is going down the shitter and people notice. Their main way of making money is by taking over parks and expanding, rather than sprucing up their existing parks. Cedar Fair parks are cleaner, have higher quality rides, and are set in better areas. The areas that Six Flags does share with a Cedar Fair park are fiercly contested or are outright dominated by the CF park. Who goes to Six Flags America when Kings Dominion is 45 minutes away? Who goes to Magic Mountain when Knott's Berry Farm is right there in LA? Who would go to La Ronde when Canada's Wonderland exists?

Long $FUN, and expect a big earnings call tomorrow.",YaBoyRustyTrombone,1572998500,18,25,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds7y4m/the_future_of_fun_or_why_you_should_buy_calls_on/
Don’t invest with Schwab [DD],"Schwab don’t want you to make money. Over in r/investing a guy went to invest with them and they only were told about diversification and ETF options. 

First hand witness said:

&gt; I love Schwab...we even went in for a portfolio review, and rather than try to sell us a bunch of Schwab products, the guy mostly talked about age appropriate diversification and ETF options.

That’s the problem with Schwab... they want you to be poor. They won’t ever tell you about deep OTM calls, FD’s or recursive call selling to create infinite leverage within your Personal Risk Tolerance.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth RobinHood the Wise?

I thought not. It's not a story the Schwab would tell you. It's a WSB legend. Darth RobinHood was a Dark Lord of Leverage, so powerful and so wise he would let you use 2k to sell ITM covered calls to create infinite leverage… He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from paying commission on OTM FD option trading.

He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was AAPL earnings report being positive, which eventually, of course, they were. Unfortunately, he taught WSB everything he knew, then his apprentices mocked him in his sleep. Ironic.

Morning Briefing (11/5/2019),"# Tariff optimism buoys rally

U.S. futures push further into record territory in a carryover trade following reports from last night that indicated the U.S. is considering rolling back some tariffs on goods imported from China. The S&amp;P 500 futures trade six points, or 0.2%, above fair value. 

Specifically, the 15% tariff rate imposed on $112 billion of Chinese imports in September may be removed while the new tariffs set to be imposed in December could be delayed, according to *The Financial Times*. Chinese negotiators have asked the U.S. to roll back even more tariffs, though, in order to sign a partial trade deal, according to *Bloomberg*.

More trade headlines should be expected, but the market has been pleased to know that discussions are progressing. **Uber** (**UBER** 29.13, -1.95, -6.3%) shareholders, meanwhile, should be encouraged by its better than expected results and upbeat guidance, but the stock continues to sell off ahead of its lock-up expiration on Wednesday. 

On the data front, investors will receive the Trade Balance report for September (Briefing.com consensus -$52.5 billion) at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for October (Briefing.com consensus 53.3) and JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for September at 10:00 a.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries are lower again, pushing yields slightly higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.82%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 97.67. WTI crude is up 0.8%, or $0.43, to $56.97/bbl. 

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **Uber** (UBER 29.13, -1.95): -6.3% despite beating top and bottom-line estimates and raising its FY19 Adj. EBITDA guidance. 
* **Shake Shack** (SHAK 69.75, -14.46): -17.2% after lowering its same-Shack sales growth guidance. The company beat earnings estimates and increased its FY19 revenue guidance. 
* **Xerox** (XRX 36.20, +1.53): +4.4% after restructuring its relationship with FUJIFILM, resulting in a $2.3 billion payout. 
* **Marriott** (MAR 128.00, -2.16): -1.7% after missing earnings estimates, although revenue was better than expected. 
* **Peloton** (PTON 25.51, +0.90): +3.7% after beating earnings estimates and guiding revenue above consensus for Q2 and FY20.

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a higher note. *Financial Times* reported last evening that U.S. officials are considering a rollback of some tariffs on imports from China that went into effect on September 1. However, press reports from China suggest that Chinese officials will push for the removal of even more tariffs before the signing of the phase one of the trade deal. The Bank of Japan made another reduction to its purchases of JGBs with long durations while Governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, called for the issuance of more long-dated debt. The Reserve Bank of Australia left its cash rate at 0.75%, as expected.

Short FB?,"So Facebook [recently announced](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/11/introducing-our-new-company-brand/) that they are rebranding.

Imagine a company of that scale using such a bad picture for this announcement. Like the colour of the letters is almost the same as the guy's shirt and it makes the logo not stand out at all. But let's forget this minor detail in comparison, here's what their plan is: 

""People should know which companies make the products they use. Our main services include the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, Workplace, Portal and Calibra.""

""Over the coming weeks, we will start using the new brand within our products and marketing materials, including a new company website.""

How delusional are they actually? Facebook is *lucky* that most of the users of Instagram and WhatsApp don't even have a clue that these services are ran by Facebook. Facebook is not cool anymore, it hasn't been in 10 years. Everyone knows that the ""boo"" in Facebook stands for ""boomer"". Some users of these services are also concerned about their data and it really won't help to remind them everytime they're using these services that all the data goes directly to Suckerberg. 

It's actually in Facebook's interest that their customers are clueless and they're doing the exact opposite to keep it that way. This is a stupid move by Facebook and it shows that they're quite delusional about the public's perception of Facebook. Pretty bad move by FB imo.",Cygopat,1572960056,54,30,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drz1ws/short_fb/
Selling home to gamble,"To preface this the  home loan would be a VA  loan and guaranteed by the government

I want to buy a home for $650,000 and sell it and put the money into the SPY stock  margin the hell out of it and just pay the $2300 a month I'd pay for my mortgage and pocket the difference.  I understand that NORMALLY banks won't let you sell your house without paying back the mortgage because its their only collateral forcing repayment of the loan. However since this is loan is guaranteed by the federal government would the bank be okay with me selling the house and just continuing to make payments? Is there anyway I could negotiate this or make it work?

Morning Briefing (11/4/2019),"# Rally continues

U.S. futures have added to last week's record-setting performance on Wall Street following some positive-sounding trade comments from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. The S&amp;P 500 futures trade 12 points, or 0.4%, above fair value. 

In an interview with *Bloomberg TV*, Mr. Ross said he is optimistic that phase one of a trade agreement will still be signed this month and that licenses for companies to work with Huawei will be granted ""very shortly."" Mr. Ross also said the U.S. may not need to initiate auto tariffs on EU imports, which has naturally bolstered the auto-sensitive stocks in the region. The Europe Stoxx 600 is currently up 0.9%. 

Corporate news hasn't been as favorable for some companies, though. **McDonald's** (**MCD** 188.56, -5.38, -2.7%) said it fired CEO Steve Easterbrook for violating company policy by having a consensual relationship with an employee. **Under Armour** (**UAA** 18.07, -3.07, -14.3%) is being probed by Federal officials over its accounting practices. 

The U.S. Treasury market is seeing less demand amid the positive sentiment reflected in the futures trade. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 97.31. WTI crude is up 1.3%, or $0.71, to $56.91/bbl.

**Asia**: Nikkei closed for holiday, Hang Seng +1.7%, Shanghai +0.6%

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region started the week on an upbeat note, bolstered by the record finish on Wall Street last week and positive-sounding trade developments. Secretary of Commerce Ross reportedly indicated that licenses for U.S. companies that enable them to do business with Huawei will be granted soon; and Mr. Ross added that good progress is being made on the ""Phase One"" deal negotiations and that the U.S. may not have to impose auto tariffs on foreign imports. Separately, Southeast Asian countries are close to signing a major trade pact in early 2020, according to *CNBC*.

Manufacturing PMI data out of the eurozone for October remained unimpressive, but with no major deterioration from preliminary readings or the prior month, the data have been received as better than feared. Separately, low-cost airline Ryanair getting some positive attention as a winner on the earnings front.

A simple solution is AI integrated traffic cameras which can easily detect things like speeding, drunk driving, potholes etc.

### Summary

We believe that Disney entering the DTC market was the right move for the following reasons. They have invested huge amounts into the tech platform (BAMTech) to enable this kind of service. They have one of the strongest brand names in media and entertainment as well that they are the leading content provider on the planet. Their studio productions will be able to serve two fold as blockbuster hits and then down the road adding to their streaming service. It only makes sense for them to dominate the growing DTC media/entertainment market.

However, the DTC market is becoming saturated with strong competitors including: Amazon Prime Video, Roku, Netflix, and now the entrants of Disney+ and the recently announced AppleTV+. We see this competition as a double-edged sword in the sense that there is the potential to grab revenues and market-share with the willingness of big companies to take some of the pie (powerful companies want to enter this market because it makes sense to), but also that more elite entrants into this already cut-throat industry is no easy task. What will separate one company from the rest will be their ability to provide quality content, which Disney has positioned themselves to do.

We believe that Disney will be sensitive to outside economic pressures that might affect their cash flow. Revenues from the Media Networks segment (and largest portion of revenues) of their business has been on the decline over recent years, but has been off-set by higher revenues from Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment. Should any of their other segments come short of providing support, their cash flow will take a hit.

The introduction of Disney+ will barely make a dent in their net revenues over the next 4-5 years. Potential growth and valuation will be highly dependent on subscriber count, but with Disneys current state of the brand and franchises they have put themselves in a great position to compete with their largest competitor, Netflix. With quality content coming from each of their studios (Marvel, Pixar, StarWars, and National Geographic, to name a few) they will have a strong line-up going into this launch.

### Final Thoughts

Disney is entering a highly competitive market, but we believe they have the right tools to succeed.

**1.** Theyve already successfully tested out the tech to launch DTC services (BAMTech - 4.9B in expenditures by FY 2020).  
**2.** Their already successful content outlets will provide a great value to their service.  
**3.** Competition, such as Netflix and AppleTV+, will be spending billions on content without a proven track-record. This is a risk for them and not so much for Disney since Disney already has a great pipeline of many quality IP.  
**4.** In terms of pricing, we see many similarities between all DTC content providers and the key factor that will separate one company from the other will be in content, which we believe Disney will provide and excel at.  
**5.** Disneys stock price has already jumped over 30% from the initial announcement of Disney+, but we think this new range will serve as a benchmark and good support.  
**6.** Disney isnt expected to report blowout subscriber count on the launch of their service, but we foresee they have the possibility to do so.  


**Positive Outlook Model:**  
\*Current revenue segments continue to grow at 18% Y.O.Y (quality studio releases, leveraging of brands to park themes, etc).  
\*Disney reports fantastic initial subscriber count for Disney+.  
\*Disney reports ESPN+ growing in-line with expectations.  


**Neutral Outlook Model:**  
\*Current revenue segments continue to grow at 18% Y.O.Y.  
\*Disney reports mediocre numbers for initial subscriber count to Disney+ (as they are expected and will be viewed as a neutral event).  


**Negative Outlook Model:**  
\*Market is affected by recession, Disney sensitivity to economic pressures.  
\*Growth slowing at media networks.  
\*Growth slowing at parks and resorts.  
\*Very low numbers for initial subscriber count to Disney+.",swaggymedia,1572793175,202,118,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dr1hjm/full_disney_due_diligence_report_inside_what/

The Real Real (REAL) real deal or flop on Monday?,"Stock that caught my attention is REAL which has earnings monday. Currently at trading at about 22.50 up 16% from October 23rd. 

Since this is WSB, I’ll soon get the point where I see an opportunity for big $$$

The Real Real is a luxury consignment platform where they have sellers selling their used luxury goods, to buyers in the market. There are similar companies like Farfetch but REAL seems to be more for the used goods market. (Gig economy) They don’t own any products but “verify authenticity” on goods that people sell to other buyers since heavily sold items are usually luxury handbags and goods. 

I see this can be a scalable opportunity for the company but having looked into customer reviews it seems there are tons of complaints on goods that are “fake” etc. This got me thinking, some goods don’t have their box or receipt and you are technically trusting that the company has done their due diligence. Even if you purchased a product from the company, how can they stop people from selling Grade A fakes passing it off with a receipt and box? 

Scanning through some customer reviews, “fake” items or items that were received but are completely different than what was posted seem to be the current narrative. Also, trying to reach customer service on refunds and returning items seem to be a huge pain in the ass. I can also see how this could be a huge issue for REAL since it is up to their platform to “authenticate” all these goods. 

The current CEO  of REAL is Julie Wainwright who ran Pets.com and probably was one of the shortest run IPO ever and we know that was a huge flop.

Farfetch is a similar ecommerce site that sells luxury brands for a discount but FTCH is currently trading at 8 dollars from its 20 dollar IPO price as well. FTCH does have more shares out than REAL but is also not completely focused on the “used” goods market. 

Going from what we’ve seen so far from ecommerce type companies this year including PINS, FTCH, I’m seeing this as an opportunity to short the shit out of this one. 

Yes Burberry announced a partnership with REAL, but this seems to already be priced in from the recent movements. 

Also another important point here is that Jim Cramer has been bigly bullish on REAL, and doing the inverse of him usually pans out well.


Anyone give me a reason why I shouldn’t short the shit out of this one come monday?",Getpaid27,1572722788,15,37,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dqp24a/the_real_real_real_real_deal_or_flop_on_monday/

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade seven points, or 0.2%, above fair value in front of the Employment Situation Report for October at 8:30 a.m. ET. Investor sentiment is relatively upbeat heading into the report following better-than-expected factory activity in China. 

In the U.S., the pace of jobs growth is expected to have slowed down noticeably, with economists attributing the 40-day strike at GM as a reason. The Briefing.com consensus is projecting nonfarm payrolls to come in at 80,000 versus 136,000 in September. Average hourly earnings are projected to increase 0.2% with the unemployment rate ticking up to 3.6%, according to the Briefing.com consensus. 

The other key report today will be the ISM Manufacturing Index for October (Briefing.com consensus 48.7), which will be released concurrently with the Construction Spending report for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET. Auto and truck sales will be released throughout the day.

Earnings reports continue to pile in, with Dow component **Exxon Mobil** (**XOM** 67.97, +0.40, +0.6%) providing mixed results. **Qorvo** (**QRVO** 90.00, +9.14, +11.3%), which is an **Apple** (**AAPL** 249.12, +0.36, +0.1%) supplier, has impressed investors with positive results and upbeat guidance. 

U.S. Treasuries are holding tight ahead of today's data on the labor market and manufacturing sector. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.25. WTI crude is up 0.5%, or $0.28, to $54.46/bbl.

Morning Briefing (11/1/2019),"# Clinging to premarket gains ahead of employment report

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade seven points, or 0.2%, above fair value in front of the Employment Situation Report for October at 8:30 a.m. ET. Investor sentiment is relatively upbeat heading into the report following better-than-expected factory activity in China.

The Briefing.com consensus is projecting nonfarm payrolls to come in at 80,000 versus 136,000 in September. Average hourly earnings are projected to increase 0.2% with the unemployment rate ticking up to 3.6%, according to the Briefing.com consensus. 

The other key report today will be the ISM Manufacturing Index for October (Briefing.com consensus 48.7), which will be released concurrently with the Construction Spending report for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET. Auto and truck sales will be released throughout the day.

It's Free Real Estate,"Not sure how many of the folks on here have been keeping up on the [slow and steady implosion](https://www.amny.com/real-estate/nyc-retail-rent-1-31125950/) of commercial real estate in the northeast, particularly in the NYC area. Agents I've spoken to suggest that this is a long-term decline mirrored by trends that extend to high-end housing as well throughout the entire surrounding area. More, perhaps, have heard of the catastrophe that WeWork's eventual failure will be for this market. For context, WeWork is the single largest commercial tenant in New York. An eventual default on rent obligations by WeWork would exacerbate the existing problems in the market, as would a general economic downturn.

Mack-Cali Realty Corporation (NYSE: [CLI](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CLI:US)) and SL Green Realty (NYSE: [SLG](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SLG:US)) are REITs invested heavily in the very same commercial real estate market in the New York area. They've been declining moderately since I started watching them but haven't seen massive outflows yet. Priced in? You be the judge.

I have decided that the most logical option for me is to go all in on Uber puts.

Morning Briefing (10/31/2019),"# Futures pull back amid flurry of earnings and renewed trade deal concerns

U.S. futures have pulled back from yesterday's FOMC-driven gains amid reported doubts from China about the feasibility of a long-term trade deal with the U.S. The S&amp;P 500 futures trade eight points, or 0.3%, below fair value. 

Specifically, Chinese officials are concerned about President Trump's ""impulsive nature"" and have warned they won't budge on certain issues, according to *Bloomberg.* Selling has been kept in check, though, with futures still near record territory amid strength in **Apple** (**AAPL** 247.10, +3.84, +1.6%) and **Facebook** (**FB** 195.80, +7.55, +4.0%) following their positive quarterly results. 

In addition, the dovish-sounding comments from Fed Chair Powell yesterday are still a positive consideration for the stock market. On a related note, the Bank of Japan left its policy rates unchanged but signaled a willingness to cut rates in the future. 

The trade headline, however, appears to be increasing demand for U.S. Treasuries, which is driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield is down six basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 97.29. WTI crude is down 0.9%, or $0.49, to $54.56/bbl. 

In economic data, investors will receive the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 216,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Employment Cost Index for the third quarter (Briefing.com consensus 0.7%), and the Personal Income (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and Spending (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) report for September at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Chicago PMI for October (Briefing.com consensus 48.2) will be released at 9:45 a.m. ET.

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **Apple** (AAPL 247.10, +3.84): +1.6% after beating top and bottom-line estimates and guiding the midpoint of Q1 revenue above consensus. 
* **Facebook** (FB 195.80, +7.55): +4.0% after beating top and bottom-line estimates. 
* **Starbucks** (SBUX 86.51, +2.32): +2.8% despite reporting in-line results and guiding FY20 EPS below consensus. 
* **Altria** (MO 46.50, +0.54): +1.2% after beating top and bottom-line estimates and writing down its Juul investment by $4.5 billion. 
* **Lyft** (LYFT 45.86, +1.75): +4.0% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, guiding Q4 revenue above consensus, and raising its Adj. EBITDA guidance.

**Asia &amp; Europe detail:**

**Asia**: Nikkei +0.4%, Hang Seng +0.9%, Shanghai -0.4%

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday on a mixed note. The overnight session featured a heavy dose of economic data, including better than expected industrial production from South Korea and weaker than expected Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI reports from China. The Bank of Japan did not make any changes to its interest rate on excess reserves, but signaled willingness to cut rates in the future. *Bloomberg* reported early this morning that Chinese officials are skeptical about the likelihood of a comprehensive long-term trade deal being reached with the U.S.

* In economic data:
   * China's October Manufacturing PMI 49.3 (expected 49.9; last 49.8) and Non-Manufacturing PMI 52.8 (expected 53.7; last 53.7)

Major European indices trade on a mostly lower note with the U.K.'s FTSE (-1.0%) showing relative weakness. Royal Dutch Shell is the weakest performer in London, falling 4.0%, after the company's better than expected results were overshadowed by a warning that growth concerns could reduce the number of shares that will be bought back by Shell. A poll conducted by *Daily Mail* showed that the U.K.'s Conservative party has an eight-point lead over Labour.

Hang Seng looks like it is going to break the recent top,"Whatever the Fed said seems to be bearish for the dollar which in turn is generally very good for Chinese stocks.  I still think China stocks are still in the early phases of a rally.  FXI is the etf if you want to take advantage of it.

I'm also bullish West Texas crude oil.  However, oil still hasn't given the full bull confirmation.  It could still be in the accumulation phase.  It made a small move down on Wednesday but is making a decent move off the Wednesday bottom.  USO is the etf to look at.

Gold is in no-man's land.  You've got a weaker dollar, but you also have a risk on rally pulling money away from safe haven assets like gold.  Both conditions have an affect on gold.  Gold isn't doing anything as a result, but a weakening treasury market would be bearish for gold.",charvo,1572487529,18,28,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpgxss/hang_seng_looks_like_it_is_going_to_break_the/

POKEMON (the biggest franchise in the world by far) is about to be released for a main Nintendo console for the first time ever in a few days. Duh, this is going to make them buckets of money. 

Going into Xmas, they have the typical Switch units and now cheaper portable units that soccer moms will buy their kids thinking it's the typical one marked down. There is basically no excuse for every kid and adult to own a Switch after this Christmas. 

Oh, and Nintendo is on the brink of opening up sales in China after striking deals with Tencent. Everyone in their totalitarian regime is going to have a switch. In CHINA. 

It's not like this shit is already at all time highs either. It's sitting at $44.06 a share and it used to be around $50 a month ago. $57 less than a year ago. It's in a clear trough. 

Tell me why I shouldn't drop 30k on this.",fvertk,1572467212,38,81,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpcb0b/nintendo_ntdoy_is_about_to_take_off/

tl;dr

$PKD wants to go private, but needs fewer than 300 shareholders to do so

They were going to do a reverse 1:100 split, cashing out anyone below 100 shares for $30 a share, and then immediately undo the split 100:1, restoring everyone who didn't get cashed out.

But then everyone started buying 99 shares to make free money (market price was like $20, so \~ $1000), so they put out a press release saying they will do a split from anywhere between 1:5 and 1:100 (whatever amount they need to do to go below 300 shareholders).

But that means you can still make free money if you buy 4 shares.

Morning Briefing (10/29/2019),"# Market pulls back ahead of FOMC meeting

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade eight points, or 0.3%, above fair value, as trade sentiment remains relatively upbeat while investors continue to monitor incoming earnings reports and the latest updates on Brexit. The benchmark index could also open the busy week near its record highs that it almost hit on Friday. 

Dow component **Walgreens Boots Alliance** (**WBA** 56.30, +0.88, +1.6%) is up nicely in pre-market action after it beat earnings expectations. Regarding Brexit, the EU has reportedly agreed to extend the Brexit deadline to Jan. 31 and would allow for an earlier exit if UK lawmakers approve the withdrawal plan in the interim.

Looking ahead, this week's biggest events will include **Alphabet's** (**GOOG** 1275, +9.87, +0.8%) earnings report after today's close, followed by **Apple's** (**AAPL** 247.40, +0.82, +0.3%) and **Facebook's** (**FB** 187.25, -0.64, -0.3%) after Wednesday's close; the FOMC's rate decision on Wednesday; and the Employment Situation Report for October on Friday.

The docket will also include the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for October on Tuesday, the first estimate for Q3 GDP on Wednesday, and the Personal Income and Spending report for September on Thursday. Today will be limited to the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories for September at 8:30 a.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries have edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.75. WTI crude is down 0.4%, or $0.23, to $56.43/bbl. 

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **AT&amp;T** (T 37.23, +0.32): +0.9% despite missing revenue estimates, although it did issue upside guidance for FY20. The company will also receive about $1.1 billion in cash and be relieved of a $575 million debt guarantee after **Central European Media** (CETV 4.60, -0.50, -1.1%) agreed to be acquired by PPF Group for $4.58/share in cash, or approximately $2.1 billion. 
* **Walgreens** (WBA 56.30, +0.88): +1.6% after beating earnings estimates and increasing its annual savings target. 
* **Microsoft** (MSFT 144.45, +3.72): +2.6% after being awarded a $10 billion DOD cloud computing contract.
* **Tiffany &amp; Co.** (TIF 126.47, +27.92): +28.4% after **LVMH** (LVMUY) confirmed that it has held preliminary discussions regarding a possible transaction with Tiffany. 

Reviewing overnight developments:

* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region followed form with the U.S. market on Friday. Japan's Nikkei +0.3%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng +0.8%, China's Shanghai Composite +0.9%, India's Sensex closed for holiday South Korea's Kospi +0.3%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries +0.02%.
   * In economic data:
      * China's September Industrial Profits -2.1% yr/yr (expected -1.2%; last -1.7%)
   * In data:
      * Investor sentiment was boosted by a Xinhua press report that suggested the U.S. and China have made progress on the text of a ""Phase One"" trade agreement. This news overshadowed China reporting a weaker than expected drop in industrial profits in September, and just about everything else in a session that lacked meaningful news drivers.
      * The BOJ policy decision sits on the near horizon with an Oct. 30-31 meeting date. This decision will follow hot on the heels of the Oct. 29-30 FOMC meeting.
* Major European indices aren't showing a lot of vigor to start the new week, although the positive mood surrounding U.S-China trade talks has been a supportive factor on the margin. STOXX Europe 600 -0.1%, Germany's DAX +0.4%, U.K.'s FTSE 100 -0.04%, France's CAC 40 +0.1%, Italy's FTSE MIB +0.1%, Spain's IBEX 35 unch. 
   * In economic data:
      * Germany's September Import Price Index +0.6% m/m (expected +0.2%; last -0.6%); -2.5% yr/yr (expected -2.9%; last -2.7%)
   * In news:
      * The EU has reportedly agreed to extend the Brexit deadline to January 31, with an opening for the UK to leave earlier if lawmakers there approve the withdrawal plan in the interim.
      * Parliament due to vote today on the issue of holding a general election on December 12.
      * S&amp;P affirmed the UK rating at AA with a Negative outlook.
      * HSBC disappointed with its quarterly report and French luxury goods giant LVMH has approached Tiffany &amp; Co. with a reported $14.5 billion takeover offer.

**Asia &amp; Europe detail:**

**Asia**: Nikkei +0.5%, Hang Seng -0.4%, Shanghai -0.9%

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific were mixed on Tuesday without a lot of news catalysts to drive things. Underlying optimism that the U.S. and China are reportedly on track with trade deal progress has helped sentiment. On a related note, the USTR said it is considering extending tariff exemptions on $34 billion of imported Chinese goods that would go into effect Dec. 28. Separately, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she expects growth in Hong Kong to be negative in 2019. Tokyo's core CPI came in softer than expected in October, with the effects of the sales tax hike garnering some attribution for the weakness.

Major European indices are experiencing modest losses, as buyers have been a reluctant bunch in today's trading action. Earnings news has failed to whet their appetite, with oil giant BP and packaging firm Stora Enso among the luminaries weighing on the bourses after reporting results that failed to please investors. The Brexit saga continues with recent news that the Labour Party is now willing to support a Dec. 12 general election knowing that a no-deal Brexit isn't in the cards for three months after the EU confirmed an Article 50 extension until January 31. The British pound had been weaker earlier, but has gained some ground following the report.

Short BG,"Maybe some of you can make some tendies with this: Bunge BG supply and distribute agri products, mostly soybean derived, and their stock has been battered since Mango Man started “winning” the trade cycle. 
There isn’t much reason to expect they will have a positive earnings because nothing has really changed in the agri trade war.


However: last earnings they popped because they had a stake in BYND and it was very profitable on their books. I don’t know the price of BYND today, but I don’t think they will have a positive earnings and anyone who can short the stock could make some money.

This is my commentary without even looking at the charts.  I think we are going to have a rally in global stocks that will be led by Chinese stocks.  Gold will probably stagnate because of capital outflows out of safe havens such as treasuries and other sovereign bonds.  I don't think gold will just collapse though.  Shorting gold is not recommended, but being long gold while risk assets are rising is a wasted opportunity.  Isn't freaky that stock markets can bottom in October and make everyone extremely bearish?  Look at the beginning of October when the markets gapped down bigtime and rallied back.  It's almost the same as October 1998 and October 2011.",charvo,1572216816,3,7,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/do0hcz/market_message_from_stockchartscom/

&amp;#x200B;

# Executive Summary

We believe that Activision Blizzards stock price has hit a point of being good value and with the most upside potential in the sub-$65 range. The company guided down on revenues last year based on the loss in popularity from some of their key franchises (WoW, Overwatch, COD). Combined with the flat outlook in the gaming industry as a whole and the stock price has seen a decline of almost 55% from peak to trough.

Rumors of Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 are expected to be confirmed at this years BlizzCon 2019. Both Overwatch and Diablo are two of their billion-dollar franchises that have recently started to see a decline in user engagement. We expect these new launches to have a huge impact on revenues down the pipeline and provide revenue growth for several years post-launch.

Classic WoW has seen some incredible numbers and the possibility for continued revenue growth by maintaining user engagement through additional content.

COD Mobile was the most successful mobile game launch of all time (100 million downloads in first week) and broke all records, including recently released Mario Kart Tour (90 million downloads) and fellow competitors Fortnite and PubG. The game also provided 17.1m in revenues during opening week alone. The new COD Mobile can be looked at as a new revenue outlet, separate from its console counterpart in the Call Of Duty brand. 

We expect the upcoming release Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare to be a big hit. The last 4 releases of Call Of Duty games earned 500m, 250m, 500m, 500m on their opening weekends, respectively. Using the positive hype from the open beta as well as the media attention from COD Mobile reaching 100m downloads in 1 week it wouldnt be unheard of to expect the new Modern Warfare to reach 750m sales on opening weekend, a 50% increase from last years game. Generally we see the success of a COD release followed by future successes down the road as the expectation from the publisher increases. It is only until a few consecutive less popular games are released that hype for the next release starts to decrease.

Our wildcard in this research is going to be Diablo Immortal, the most recent sequel in the Diablo hack and slash series designed strictly for play on mobile devices. Diablo Immortal was announced at last years Blizzcon 2018 with an expected 2019 release date, but as of yet none has been set. There was some backlash based on some of the gameplay footage not holding true to the classic diablo feel, but otherwise not much is known about this game. We expect a launch some time in 2020 (this is our estimation and opinion only).

Since recent news of Classic WoW and COD Mobiles successes the stock price has risen from $45 to just over $55. This leads me to believe that some of this good news is already priced in. However, an unknown variable that could propagate the stock price further is what lies ahead for these games. This unknown factor will rely on how well the management of Activision Blizzard is able to capitalize on this massive growth of user engagement from the recent successes of staple franchises. We believe the time is now for ATVI and give them a positive outlook.

Although COD Mobile and Diablo Immortal (when released) are already existing franchises this is the first time they are bringing them to mobile. The success of Fortnite, PubG, and the likes of those types of games has created a new era of mobile gaming. Therefore we see mobile versions of these games to be completely new revenue streams with unique DLC and content updates. A player who purchases DLC on COD Mobile will also have the potential for a sale on COD: Modern Warfare and vice-versa.

The recent political debacle could be a factor, but will be unknown how it will reflect on the company until the company reports some of the data. What we do know is that ATVI hasnt fully tapped the China market, and although they have upset a lot of gamers, they are siding with money over popularity and doing the right thing.

# Expected Drivers Of Revenue

**Short Term (0-2 Years)** New Overwatch 2 release\*. \*Not confirmed. Additional WoW content. COD Mobile DLC, additional content, and new releases. COD: Modern Warfare expected massive launch will temporarily breathe life back into the Call Of Duty brand and give ATVI the opportunity to capitalize.

**Long Term (2 Years +)** Regaining popularity of COD Mobile + Console games can lead to future successful launches. Regaining popularity of WoW + additional content to maintain user engagement. A successful Overwatch 2 release will lead to multiple years of revenue growth. Diablo Mobile hit or miss has potential to be new revenue outlet. Diablo 4, one of Activision Blizzards most successful franchises in the pipeline, should expect to see similar successes.

**Positive Outlook:** Classic WoW is able to maintain user-engagement of approximately 4m+ subscribers. COD Mobile generates monthly revenues of 20-40m and \*key point\* is sustained until next release or added DLC. COD Modern Warfare hits 750m+ sales opening weekend, restores faith in the Call Of Duty franchise. Overwatch 2 + Diablo 4 announcement at BlizzCon 2019. King segment of revenues and MAUs is maintained by successful expansions/releases.

**Neutral Outlook:** Classic WoW displays great subscriptions for the quarter, but expects a drop in subscriptions over subsequent quarters. \* COD Mobile shows hit numbers + revenues, but fails to maintain user-engagement in the long-term. COD Modern Warfare brings in 500m revenues opening weekend, as such did their last 2 titles. King segment shows slight decline in MAUs.

**Negative Outlook:** Classic WoW has sharp decline in subscriptions post-launch. This demonstrates people were hyped to initially play the game, but it wasnt enough to keep players engaged long-term. COD Mobile proves to be a poor revenue stream outside its first week launch (we already know it did 17.1m revenues first-week revenues). King segment and one of their most stable segments over the last 2 years begins to see a decline as Candy Crush + expansions lose traction in the market. BlizzCon 2019 doesnt announce anything note-worthy. Political debacle has larger-than-expected effect on Activision Blizzards player-base.",swaggymedia,1572209588,32,18,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dnz3oa/first_edition_of_swaggystocks_due_diligence_all/

Anyways, I tried my best to cover all the good ones, but there were some I just could not get to as I have been locked in my room for two days straight making this. I need to get some sleep tonight as I have a date tomorrow.

Morning Briefing (10/25/2019),"# Futures holding up

U.S. equity futures have fared relatively well this morning despite the discouraging quarterly results and guidance from **Amazon** (**AMZN** 1680.00, -100.78, -5.7%). The S&amp;P 500 futures trade two points, or 0.1%, below fair value. 

Amazon's earnings results came up short of expectations, and it guided down Q4 profit and revenue below consensus. On the positive side, Dow components **Intel** (**INTC** 54.43, +2.20, +4.2%), **Visa** (**V** 177.64, +1.48, +0.8%), and **Verizon** (**VZ** 61.25, +0.67, +1.1%) all beat earnings expectations.

Other than earnings news, headlines about China's willingness to purchase more agricultural products and the EU leaning on the side of a Brexit extension have seemingly given investors some thinking to do on these prolonged situations. Neither has had much sway on the market today. 

Economic data will be sparse, with the final reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for October (Briefing.com consensus 95.8) due out at 10:00 a.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 97.68. WTI crude is down 0.2%, or $0.10, to $56.13/bbl. 

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **Amazon** (AMZN 1680.00, -100.78): -5.7% after missing earnings estimates and guiding down Q4 profit and revenue below consensus. 
* **Intel** (INTC 54.43, +2.20): +4.2% after beating top and bottom-line estimates and issuing upside guidance for Q4 and FY19. 
* **Visa** (V 177.64, +1.48): +0.8% after beating earnings estimates and raising its dividend 20%. 
* **Verizon** (VZ 61.25, +0.67): +1.1% after beating earnings expectations. 
* **Anheuser-Busch InBev** (BUD 84.23, -7.37): -8.1% after missing top and bottom-line estimates. 
* **V.F. Corp** (VFC 81.10, -9.72): -10.7% after missing earnings estimates. 

Reviewing overnight developments:

* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region had a fairly quiet end to the week, with most posting modest gains. Japan's Nikkei +0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.5%, China's Shanghai Composite +0.5%, India's Sensex +0.1%, South Korea's Kospi +0.1%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries +0.6%.
   * In economic data:
      * South Korea's October Consumer Confidence 98.6 (expected 100.0; last 96.9)
      * Singapore's Unemployment Rate 2.3% (last 2.2%); September Industrial Production +3.7% m/m (expected +0.1%; last -7.3%) and +0.1% yr/yr (expected -4.1%; last -6.4%)
   * In news:
      * Not surprisingly, China reportedly didn't like Vice President Pence's tough-minded talk in yesterday's speech, yet it isn't expected to cut off trade deal discussions.
      * Reuters is reporting that China wants the U.S. to cancel the tariff hike set to go into effect December 15 and remove the tariff imposed on September 15 in exchange for boosting its purchases of U.S. agricultural products.
      * Bank of Japan policy decision looms next week.
* Major European indices are mixed without a lot of notable movement on either side of the unchanged line. STOXX Europe 600: -0.3% Germany's DAX: -0.1% U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.5% France's CAC 40: +0.1% Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.1% Spain's IBEX 35: +0.1%
   * In economic data:
      * Germany's November Gfk Consumer Climate Index 9.6 (expected 9.8; last 9.8); October Ifo Business Climate Index 94.6 (expected 94.5; last 94.6)
      * France's September PPI +0.1% m/m (expected +0.3%; last 0.0%)
      * Spain's September PPI -3.3% yr/yr (last -2.5%)
   * In news:
      * Market participants are digesting more earnings news and seemingly have some indigestion over the ongoing Brexit saga. The EU has reportedly concurred that an extension should be granted, but it has not reached a decision on how long an extension should last.
      * Parliament is set to vote Monday on whether to hold a general election on Dec. 12, per Prime Minister Johnson's proposal to hold one then in exchange for allowing lawmakers more time to consider the Withdrawal Agreement.
      * Germany's Ifo Business Climate Index for October was unchanged from September, suggesting there could be some needed stabilization emerging in the business climate in Germany.

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region had a fairly quiet end to the week, with most posting modest gains.

On a related note, *Reuters* is reporting that China wants the U.S. to cancel the tariff hike set to go into effect December 15 and remove the tariff imposed on September 15 in exchange for boosting its purchases of U.S. agricultural products. Bank of Japan policy decision looms next week.

PPL, trading around 33, some small scale Pennsylvania energy company. 5% dividend and 10% from selling one covered call contract $1 otm a month; position of 100 shares for 3.3k nets $450 over the year. Easy fucking tendies!!

Best part is though, there's some merger talk in the works... that's where the insane fucking tendies come in. Sell deep out of the money calls for a couple bucks, or just don't sell them at all. Fuck, at this point, you might just want to buy the fucking calls, catch the full force of this upward swing so you don't feel like a jackass when you're standing there with your $200 from the movement and $5 from selling shitty calls with your dick in your hand while the underlying equity is rushing past the 40's like a horny college student trying to fuck your mom and working his way into the 50's, oh god, he's getting into the 60's now, what the hell are we doing with a fucking closed position 30 points ago!!

$ATVI DD,"**TL:DR**

Tomorrow CoD Modern Warfare is releasing 

CoD Mobile has 35 million downloads

WoW Classic has been a success for the most part

ATVI earnings are in 2 weeks. 

IV is still low on Calls

——————

So tomorrow Cod MW is releasing. This game has had honestly the most hype since MW2 and GTA V. 


The video game industry is dying for a real game. They tried sci-fi with shooting people in space and walking on walls. People didn’t like that. 


They decided to #tbt to the good ol’ days and ya that was fun for a while until people got bored of it. 


A key example of this is the ArmA series. The ArmA series was mainly contemporary until the release of ArmA 3, which took a mild albeit radical shift to 2035. 


Now now I know tf does that have to do with this? ArmA 3 has a very robust modding community. You know how many of these futuristic mods they have that *aren’t* inspired by other games? NONE. 


We weebs need another contemporary style shooter. And with the performance of the Beta weekends, which also had the most participants of ANY CoD Beta... ATVI is gonna be delivering tendies I tell you. 

———

Now, how to play this? 


Since I lost too much money because of you fucks I’m playing stonks this time. I’m gonna hold through until earnings. Its gonna hit 60$ by the next EOW if they pump out numbers for CoD sales. 


Fortnite might be king but CoD has a place in all of your hearts.

ROKU to the Moon! ATM by end of month!,"ROKU acquisition today DD from a few days ago

I think this is a game-changing acquisition.....under appreciated as of today....that will change quickly. Amazon and Trade Desk should be worried. Jeff Bezos definitely does not like shaking hands on an agreement with a partner that eventually agrees to be bought out by his rival.

And now Roku owns them.....

Oh and also last week Roku added support for an Apple TV app. 

It’s unlikely knowing Apple‘s track record that it will enable a Apple TV app on their streaming competitors platform (Amazon Fire)

I can hear some of you retards saying this in my head before I post this so let’s address this:


[“_bUt iT dROpPeD tODaY?_ “](https://google.com/search?q=acquisition+effect+on+stock+price) yep, that’s normal. When a company acquires another company, typically the stock price of the target company rises while the stock price of the acquiring company declines in the short-term.

I now or soonish is a great time to get in, especially after today and could be seeing new all time highs leading up or right after their upcoming ER on Nov 6th

Let’s watch how tomorrow plays.


This is a good breakdown in the conclusion https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dataxu-acquisition-means-roku-stock-211816340.html

They have the largest market share already.

Now what do you think will happen to apples market share now that Roku has Apple TV support? Exactly. 

The Roku app are built into most smart TVs and that doesn’t seem to be changing.

Why AMZN could beat earnings today,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/amazon-earnings-q2-2019.html

During the previous quarter's earnings, AMZN missed due to a drop in profit: not revenue. They beat revenue estimates but lost in profit margins from an $800mil investment in their warehouses and such. Now, I don't know if these prodit margin eating investments have seeped into this quarter because I am no AMZN insider, but AMZN is very likely to beat Q3 expectations IF they don't have such investments.

Amazon Web Services is a core part of the business, and is threatened by MSFT's Azure. But, Azure's growth has slowed a teensy bit, meaning they are not taking away AS much market share from AWS,  *potentially.*

Bottom line: consider Azure's threat to AWS and profit margin eating investments (whether or not they are occuring) when playing earnings today. And DO NOT buy 10/25 options: Theta and IV got big dick energy, and the IV crush will account for an even bigger drop in premium than Vega.

Morning Briefing (10/24/2019),"# Busy earnings day set to start on positive note

U.S. equity futures are slightly higher this morning, as investors digest another big batch of earnings results and some details on the U.S.-China trade front. The S&amp;P 500 futures trade seven points, or 0.2%, above fair value. 

Most companies since yesterday's close have beaten earnings expectations, including **Microsoft** (**MSFT** 138.69, +1.45, +1.1%), **Dow Inc.** (**DOW** 47.55, +1.55, +3.3%), and **Tesla** (**TSLA** 300.80, +46.12, +18.5%). **3M** (**MMM** 163.97, -4.97, -2.8%) and **Twitter** (**TWTR** 32.27, -6.56, -16.9%) are some notable exceptions, with both also issuing downside guidance. 

Futures ticked up to session highs earlier after *Bloomberg News* reported China is aiming to buy at least $20 billion of agricultural products in one year if a partial trade deal is signed. Separately, the European Central Bank left its key rates unchanged, as widely expected. 

On the data front, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for September (Briefing.com consensus -1.0%) and the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 217,000) and Continuing Claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by New Home Sales for September (Briefing.com consensus 703,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 97.51. WTI crude is down 0.3%, or $0.14, to $55.83/bbl.

**Asia &amp; Europe detail:**

**Asia**: Nikkei +0.6%, Hang Seng +0.9%, Shanghai flat

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region stood their ground for the most part, logging modest gains in most instances as selling interest was held in check. Economic data was unimpressive, though, as Q3 GDP growth slowed in South Korea and Japan's preliminary manufacturing PMI for October slipped further into contraction territory with a reading of 48.5 (prior 48.9). Separately, The Bank of Indonesia cut its key lending rate 25 basis points, as expected, to 5.00%.

* In economic data:
   * South Korea's Q3 GDP +0.4% qtr/qtr (expected +0.5%; last +1.0%)
   * Japan's prelim. October manufacturing PMI 48.5 (last 48.9); Leading Economic Index for August 91.9 (expected 91.7; last 93.7)

Major European indices have a bounce in their step this morning, posting gains across the board in advance of the ECB interest rate decision at 07:45 ET.  Investor sentiment being helped by the positive bias in the U.S. market, which has taken root after better-than-expected earnings news. Automaker Daimler is seeing a nice bid after its third quarter report and is helping to lend support, yet Nokia is a major laggard in European action after cutting its outlook for 2019 and 2020. Preliminary manufactuing PMI data for October remained underwhelming. Separately, attention being paid to reports that UK Prime Minister Johnson is likely to call for early elections if the Brexit deadline is pushed out to the end of January 2020.

BA Put Holder Support and Education Thread,"Hey guys, how ya doing?  Just wanted to check in, I don't have any trades in Boeing (bc I'm autistic but not retarded).  How you guys holding up?  Perhaps you're thinking, ""OMG THEY MISSED REVENUES BY 53% SO HOW THE FUCK ARE THEY UP 3.5% THIS MORNING???? AHHHHHH!!!""  As with my other posts... the National Suicide Hotline Prevention number is: 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7.  


**TL;DR: Don't get bet against Boeing bc there are too many major players with huge amounts of interest in supporting the stock.**  


So here's some education for you on why you should never bet against Boeing and INSTEAD should go long EVERY time it hits the $300 - $320 range.    
1) The chart: Go look at a two year daily chart for BA.  EVERY time it's hit this range it proceeds to catch an uptick of around $20 - 40 dollars.  EVEN IN Q4 2018 BA DIPPED BELOW $300 FOR ALL OF TWO DAYS.    


2) There are basically two makers of commercial aircraft in the world: Boeing and Airbus.  The lower Boeing stock goes the more likely it is that Airbus (a competitor that the US government openly has said it does not want to give up an inch to) takes away market share from Boeing.  Therefore, BA has a synthetic floor underneath it.  


3) If you are operating under the assumption that we live in a free market that is based off of fundamentals then you have gone full retard and you never go full retard.  It is in US interests to make sure that Boeing stock stays strong, or perhaps a better way to phrase it, does not weaken beyond a certain point.  When the stock does weak to a certain point you'll start to see talking points coming out of the FAA or BA about how they think they're close to getting the 737 MAX back in service.  


4) Fund managers are actively aware that this stock will be stuck in a trading range until the 737 MAX shit clears up.  Therefore, they are selling every top and buying every bottom.  So, EVERY time Boeing climbs up you can count on a big sell off from bad news, however, that sell off is only going to go to a certain point (see point #1) bc at that $300ish level algos gonna step back in and start buying again.  Why?  Bc, referring to point #2, if you want to invest in aircraft manufacturing you don't have a ton of options.",Xayde26,1571839857,44,19,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dlzv7f/ba_put_holder_support_and_education_thread/
Morning Briefing (10/23/2019),"# Earnings weighing on futures

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade six points, or 0.2%, below fair value following some disappointing earnings results and guidance from **Caterpillar** (**CAT** 131.95, -1.74, -1.3%) and **Texas Instruments** (**TXN** 116.70, -11.87, -9.2%). 

Both companies missed top and bottom-line estimates, with Caterpillar issuing downside FY19 guidance and Texas Instruments issuing downside Q4 guidance. Shares of Caterpillar, however, have significantly cut losses after being down about 4% earlier. 

**Boeing** (**BA** 340.85, +3.50, +1.0%) missed earnings estimates, too, but investors have been comforted by the company still expecting the 737 MAX to return to service this year. Shares initially fell 2% as the company also pushed back 777X first deliveries to early 2021, but the 737 outlook has given the battered stock some reprieve. 

U.S. Treasuries are up in textbook fashion following disappointing guidance from economically-sensitive companies. The 2-yr yield is down six basis points to 1.55%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 97.55. WTI crude is down 1.0%, or $0.54, to $53.96/bbl. 

On the data front, the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 11.9% following a 0.5% increase in the prior week. Later, investors will receive the FHFA Housing Price Index for August at 9:00 a.m. ET.

**Asia &amp; Europe detail:**

**Asia**: Nikkei +0.3%, Hang Seng -0.8%, Shanghai -0.4%

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region turned in some generally underwhelming performances on Wednesday, as the disappointing earnings report and outlook from Texas Instruments and the swirl of uncertainty surrounding Brexit left buyers in a guarded mood. There was also a lack of meaningful economic data to stir things up. In news, Beijing is reportedly looking into replacing Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, the IMF said growth in Asia in 2019 could slip to 5.0% from its prior forecast of 5.4%, and China, according to *Bloomberg*, is granting more waivers for buyers to step up purchases of U.S. soybeans.

* In economic data:
   * Singapore September CPI +0.5% yr/yr (expected 0.5%; last 0.5%)

Major European indices have followed suit with their Asian counterparts and have thus far delivered an underwhelming performance. The drama surrounding the timeline for Brexit has kept investor conviction in check, along with an earnings warning out of Heineken. Disappointing quarterly results and guidance from both Texas Instruments and Caterpillar has the futures market presaging a negative start for the U.S. stock market, which has been another drag on sentiment. The euro and the British pound are both down 0.1% against the dollar.

giving the heads up for an upcoming rally in China stocks with gold declining,"My charts are reflecting a huge shift in asset allocation for Chinese investors selling their physical gold and putting it back into stocks.  Maybe stuff over there got so bad that investor sentiment hit rock bottom at least for the short-term.  I'm buying more FXI.  The big thing here is that Chinese stocks have shown better relative strength than the S&amp;P 500 in recent days enough to flip charts to the bullish side.  Charts have been bearish for Chinese stocks vs the S&amp;P 500 since early May of this year.  Things have changed.  This may be bullshit, but do what you want with your money.  Gold, on the otherhand, is going to hit the skids here.  The best case scenario for gold is to just do nothing, but that's not going to happen with the TLT possibly making a significant top.  If the TLT breaks the September lows, it's going to problematic for gold because gold basically follows treasuries in price.",charvo,1571704797,5,23,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl9vpl/giving_the_heads_up_for_an_upcoming_rally_in/

Playing with BA is playing with fire. Some DD,[removed],Orgasimo,1571687788,1,0,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl5yb1/playing_with_ba_is_playing_with_fire_some_dd/
BA is a massive dumpster fire. You should YOLO puts! (Or should you?),"I've been following BA for the past four months or so, buying in and out and profit some dollars here and there, and I've been observing how the stock reacts to news regarding the 737. It has been, to say the least, volatile unpredictable and nonsensical. Read on if you are not illiterate like much of this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to the last earnings report, news came out with the exact figure that Boeing was going to lose with the 737 not being sold. (I can't find that exact figure). Point is, the figure was not seen to be as high as investors expected, so the BA went from the 330ish range up to 380ish over a couple days. Fast forward a day or two when earnings are released: predicted EPS was 1.85 while the real EPS was 2.92, a 57.8% surprise. Despite the incredible beat, BA proceeded to plummet down below 340.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next several weeks leading up to now the news cycle continued, bringing forth positive or negative news and the stock acted accordingly. This leads us to now:

&amp;#x200B;

With the recent reports of the FAA allegedly being lied to about the 737's progress, the stock has seen a drop from nearly 400 back down to 330. Seeing as the recent lows of bad news has not stretched beyond the depths of 320, BA is near the low of the past several months. This means that if BA performs poorly with regards to their predicted EPS than it hasn't much room to drop unless something spectacularly bad happens. It has already dropped nearly $70 dollars a share so a similar drop due to the earnings report is unlikely.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other side of the proverbial coin, if BA manages to beat the very poor expectations for them this upcoming earnings, they could move up very well. If good news regarding the FAA debacle drops at around the same time as a solid earnings report, kiss your put value goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion: there are a lot of unknowns regarding BA, particularly around this upcoming earnings report. It isn't set in stone whether calls or puts will reign in a tendie pile. Distrust any stupid idiot autists that is solid bear or bull with BA. I do not have any money in play with BA, and am instead going with less uncertain plays like V or MSFT. Good luck with your earnings plays, gentlemen (I assume there're no ladies that browse this sub)

IRBT DD: earnings are Tuesday (10/22),"These guys sell those $1,000 robo vacuums that do their job kind of good once and then get stuck on a sock under the couch where you forget about it. Sounds stupid as shit, right? Not so fast.

For my true Wsb'ers, I'll cut to the chase: 

IRBT either pops or drops +10% each earnings.

They have a small share float of just 28m shares with 30% short. 

They're down 37% on the year. 1Y chart looks like this stock just needs a reason to go up.

Next week's IV for earnings is +100% with an expected +$8-9 move.

Actual DD: They lowered guidance last earnings because they let everyone know their margins could be impacted by the trade war. Expectations are low. They also have one of the cleanest balance sheets I've ever set my eyes on. They just unveiled their new robotic lawnmower that's one of a kind.

Not only that, but they also have an ongoing lawsuit against an evenly matched competitor they're favored to win and are also a very suited candidate for an acquisition.

Looking at BYND restaurant partnerships,"I'm trying to be responsible and do some actual research on a YOLO.

I'm thinking BYND is going to continue to tank, but I started to get a little concerned when I read about Burger King's potential success with the Impossible Whopper ([https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/16/the-impossible-whopper-is-driving-steady-traffic-to-burger-king-data-shows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/16/the-impossible-whopper-is-driving-steady-traffic-to-burger-king-data-shows.html)).  Plus I've been seeing commercials for the Impossible Burger, so BK is clearly feeling good about it.  I know the Impossible Whopper is not a BYND product, but if Burger King  can do well with it then I imagine that BYND's retail partners (McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, KFC, Tim Hortons) can do well with their plant based crap as well.

As I was looking at [this coming week's earnings](https://i.imgur.com/NISjWBZ.png) I thought to myself that it would really suck if Beyond Meat came up on McDonald's earnings call (Tuesday @ 11:00 AM  ET), and they said that the test was going really well or something.  I think it's probably too early for them to make that kind of statement since the test began less than a month ago, but still the thought crossed my mind.  

So I thought...I wonder how the BYND test is going at McDonalds.  I started poking around to see what I could find and I have been relieved so far to learn the following:

\- The McDonald's product is named ""P.L.T."" (or Plant Lettuce Tomato), significant in my mind for two reasons:

1. No mention of the Beyond brand name, so even if the product does well, McDonald's can work with another supplier ([like what Dave &amp; Buster's just did to it's Impossible Burger](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/18/business/dave-and-busters-impossible/index.html))
2. It's an ugly name and based off of name alone I'd much rather eat an Impossible Whopper than a PLT.  I don't know who would go to McDonald's thinking ""I'm definitely in the mood for plant right now""

\- I found this article [https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2019/09/30/i-drove-to-canada-to-try-the-mcdonalds-plt-heres-what-it-tastes-like/#6c4a16d3367f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2019/09/30/i-drove-to-canada-to-try-the-mcdonalds-plt-heres-what-it-tastes-like/#6c4a16d3367f) which describes how there was minimal signage about the PLT at the McDonald's serving the PLT.

And since I live in Manhattan, and I get coffee at Dunkin' Donuts 4-5 times per week, and [Dunkin Donuts is supposedly testing a Beyond Meat Sausage Sandwich in Manhattan](https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/beyond-meat-dunkin) I started thinking about that test as well.  I started checking my Dunkin Donuts app which I use to order on the go and I could not find the Beyond Meat sandwhich available on the app ordering menu at any locations in Manhattan (I checked about 10 locations).  I also just emailed Dunkin Donuts support to see if they can help me locate the Beyond Meat sandwhich, and I'll be getting a coffee there in the morning tomorrow so I'll make sure to ask at the store when I grab my coffee.  

Lastly regarding the Dunkin Donuts partnership, the guy who Dunkin credits for introducing the Beyond Meat product at their stores (their CMO) [just announced his departure from the company this week](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/dunkin-cmo-steps-down/).  That can't be good for BYND if he was spearheading any efforts to promote their product.

Anyone else have local insight on what they're seeing at any of the Beyond Meat restaurant partners? Or alternative angles on this?",dlm423,1571451492,41,54,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djxo6d/looking_at_bynd_restaurant_partnerships/

Morning Briefing (10/18/2019),"# Futures flattish as market digests earnings

U.S. futures are relatively flat, as investors weigh mixed data out of China against decent earnings reports from Dow components **Coca-Cola** (**KO** 54.45, +0.66, +1.2%) and **American Express** (**AXP** 120.90, +1.80, +1.5%). The S&amp;P 500 futures are currently trading three points, or 0.1%, above fair value. 

Specifically, China's Q3 GDP grew 6.0% yr/yr, which was down from 6.2% last quarter and less than the 6.1% expected growth figure. The GDP miss weighed on China's Shanghai Composite (-1.3%) on Friday, even though industrial production and retail sales for September did increase more than expected. 

Back on the home front, the first big week of earnings season is wrapping up and results continue to come in mostly better than expected. Coca-Cola reported revenue that was just above expectations, and it slightly improved its revenue outlook. American Express beat earnings estimates and reported in-line revenue. 

Today's economic data will be limited to the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%) at 10:00 a.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.46. WTI crude is up 1.1%, or $0.57, to $54.50/bbl.

* **Coca-Cola** (KO 54.45, +0.66): +1.2% after reporting in-line results and slightly improving its revenue outlook.

How to efficiently YOLO (retarded non-retarded edition),"Since you retards like to YOLO your college loans, yall should atleast be doing it when the market is more likely to make a big move to actually have a chance of making money. Instead of YOLOing at random, I can show you a non-retard retarded way of YOLOing efficiently.

All you need are two things: Robinhood, ThinkOrSwim

Go to thinkorswim studies and enable ""TTM\_Squeeze"". This Indicator uses super complicated voodoo shit to show when stock is building up momentum for upto a 2 standard deviation move. All you retards have to do is the YOLO when the dots are red and this shit will increase your chance of success anywhere between 69 to 420%! 

Lemme give you an example on Netflix. As you can see the indicator predicated a possible YOLO that resulted in a big move on two

[//imgur.com/a/73rc9T3](//imgur.com/a/73rc9T3)

And guess what, this works on EVERY STOCK, not just netflix!

Oh no It doesn't just stop there, this can be used on the VIX as well to know when to short the WHOLE MARKET (SPY). When there is a squeeze on the vix when it is at support, YOLO PUTS! here is an image for reference:

[//imgur.com/a/4s9CvYy](//imgur.com/a/4s9CvYy)

Beware: This strategy is better used when you yolo using options farther out and not the weeklys. I recommend 10 to 60 days out for best results. Happy Trading!",LegendaryWar,1571369547,303,113,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djhobg/how_to_efficiently_yolo_retarded_nonretarded/
Moving from CDN to USD ?," It is now moving into the second half of October and this is when stocks start their seasonal increase until May. The 2-3 weeks have been losing weeks for the TSX and I think I need to have more US stocks as they are now performing a lot better than Canadian stocks and should keep increasing into 2020. 

  Buy a few more shares of BIP.un (Brookfield Infrastructure Partners), This pays a good dividend (4.1%) and has lots of upward potential and Brookfield keeps buying new airports, sea ports, toll highways etc. I've owned this stock for a few years and it has increased handsomely over this time   


 keep watching Interfor and Superior Plus as candidates to sell if they don't start going up. The forest industry (IFP) is in a real decrease this year as housing starts in the US and Canada are way down. However, most of the lumber companies have shut down a good deal of their production and inventories are on the way down. If housing starts take off in the spring as I think they will, lumber stocks will soar. If IFP does not go up appreciably by March 2020, I should sell it. Propane companies like Superior Plus do well in the winter months, if this is a colder than average winter, this stock will do well and it does pay a 6% dividend while we wait.   


 Buy MA (Mastercard), DIS (Disney), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alibaba (BABA) and if you don't want to buy BABA because it is a Chinese company (it is the Chinese version of Amazon) but it is more encompassing and growing faster in Asia and has more upside than Amazon, 30% over the next year,  these listed blue chip companies have great futures ahead of them and they will be around decades from now

DD INSIDE - Bullish on $QSR for the next 3 months,"TL;DR at the end.

I believe $QSR is due for a sharp price increase over the next 3 months for the following reasons:

First it is important to understand what Restaurant Brands International ($QSR) is. This is a joint venture started in 2014 which owns Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. A majority of their holdings consist of BK and TH, and Popeyes is a minority at around 15% of their total restaurants. However, it is important to note that historically Popeyes has been a weak performer for $QSR compared to their other brands but this may have changed for Q3 with their release of a new chicken sandwich which triggered a social media frenzy and resulted in their selling out of the sandwich with Tyson foods unable to keep up with demand.

Now let’s break down by restaurant why $QSR may beat:

- Burger King sales in Q3 May have been driven by Impossible Burger demand as reported [Here](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/16/the-impossible-whopper-is-driving-steady-traffic-to-burger-king-data-shows.html).
- Popeyes as stated above had a huge demand for their sandwich after its release in August which likely drove up sales quite significantly.
- Tim Horton’s did not have any driving factors during Q3 which would indicate an increase in sales but there is no reason to believe they will report a decrease either.

Now let’s look at where the stock sits as of today. $QSR has consistently sold off over the past 2 months after setting a new ATH at $78 in late August. The stock now sits in the $69-$70 range, only 3% higher than the stock’s high point in 2017 despite strong growth over the past 2 years. Sell side price targets average near $93 representing over a 30% upside from the current trading price.

Okay so this thing could pop, what play should I chose? Historically, $QSR has not been very volatile so short dated options are probably not the best idea to play earnings. Instead, I would recommend longer dated options expiring in January or later At or Near The Money. Hopefully strong earnings will create demand and drive price higher, which has the potential to short squeeze the stock due to the large short volume which would be forced to cover after such an increase.

In their earnings call I would expect them to announce strong EPS and Rev while increasing guidance in anticipating the growth of meat alternative products at their restaurants.

TL;DR:
$QSR may run up to the high 80’s over the next 3 months due to strong performance among their 3 brand holdings in Q3 and a potential short squeeze.",PapaMusk69,1571327786,42,36,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dj8ct1/dd_inside_bullish_on_qsr_for_the_next_3_months/

Morning Briefing (10/17/2019),"# Earnings results driving futures higher

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade 13 points, or 0.4%, above fair value as reactions to earnings reports remain mostly positive while a draft Brexit deal provides some relief for the market.

Positive results and upbeat guidance from **Taiwan Semi** (**TSM** 51.07, +0.94, +1.9%) could bode well for the semiconductor space today. 

Elsewhere, a revised Brexit deal was announced today, setting up a crucial vote in the British Parliament that could come this Saturday. European stocks and the British pound pushed to session highs, but some of the enthusiasm has waned after leaders from the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party voiced their opposition to the agreement.

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday on a mixed note.

Major European indices trade in mixed fashion after backing off their highs. Regional markets surged in early action after British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, announced that a revised Brexit deal has been reached.

Baxdela (Delafloxacin) from Melinta Therapeutics (MLNT)- RCR biotech,"Hey, guys. It's Casey and Eshaan from RCR biotech, we're a medical student and neurobiology/business school student that helps try to identify biotech companies/drugs we find potentially lucrative, and explain the mechanism, logistics, etc. as simply as possible. Last week we posted asking for companies you wanted DD on. We're still going through the comments and selecting a few that we like. In the process, we stumbled upon an antibiotic &amp; company we really liked, and wanted to share that information with you. Below is our newest blog post.

**TLDR- Summary &amp; Thoughts**

In summary, Baxdela (Melinta Therapeutics; MLNT) is an FDA-approved drug for skin infection that has a PDUFA date on October 24th for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.  Baxdela comes from a class of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones) that is used frequently to treat pneumonia.  However, its unique chemical structure makes it more potent at sites of infection compared to other antibiotics in its family.  Previous Phase 3 trials show non-inferiority (which is good) compared to expensive, “big gun” antibiotics in the treatment of skin infections.  Additionally, those clinical trials also suggest Baxdela is fairly well-tolerated by patients.  In turn, this drug represents a novel antibiotic in the time of rising rates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (which causes \~$84billion/year of health care charges). While we got in the game a bit late (\~$3.89/share), we still think Melinta Therapeutics (MLNT) will continue to rise up to- and after the PDUFA date on October 24th.

**FULL POST**

**What it is**–

Baxdela (Delafloxacin) is a novel fluoroquinolone antibiotic produced by Melinta Therapeutics (MLNT). Fluoroquinolones are one several different types of antibiotics, including:

1. Sulfonamides
2. Beta-lactams (ie. penicillin, ampicillin)
3. Tetracylins (ie. doxycycline)
4. Macrolides
5. Aminoglycosides
6. Fluoroquinolones

Each class of antibiotic is effective against different combinations of strains of bacteria.  While the specifics of bacterial coverage are out of context of this post, Baxdela has VERY wide coverage of bacteria, including gram positives, gram negatives, MRSA, anaerobic, and intracellular bacteria.

**Why we like it-**

In the age of antibiotic resistance, it’s been difficult to 1.create new drugs and 2. get them through the FDA pipeline.  It previously gained FDA approval for the treatment of soft-tissue infections, and now is being evaluated for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).  CAP is an infection of the lungs from bacteria encountered through everyday life (compared to hospital-acquired pneumonia which tend to be different strains of bacteria).  CAP is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization, causing all sorts of problems, including death.  In 2014, pneumonia caused $84 billion dollar in health care-related charges.  MRSA is a common cause of pneumonia (although not #1), and having an arsenal of different drugs with efficacy against this antibiotic-resistant strain of bacteria is becoming more and more important.

While it comes from the fluoroquinolone family, it has a unique chemical structure that makes it more potent in acidic environments (like sites of infection) compared to other fluoroquinolones.  In two different Phase 3 trials, Baxdela reached non-inferiority against two “big gun” drugs (Vancomycin and Aztreonam) in treatment of MRSA skin infections.  Additionally, in the PROCEED Phase 3 clinical trial, the incidence of adverse effects causing discontinuation was lower in Baxdela (0.9%) compared to Vanc/Azt (4.3%). 

**Melinta Therapeutics Logistics-**

MLNT does not have that long a history of financials available, but what has been released since the company went public shows a promising company with increasing revenues and gross margins (GM increased \~10.5% between 2018 and trailing twelve months (TTM)), and shifting expenses from R&amp;D to SG&amp;A, indicating a company ready to pivot from therapeutic discovery to marketing a promising drug. Additionally, net income has increased between 2018 and TTM, which for an early stage pharmaceutical company is a good sign that the heavy R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses that have been incurred may be leading to some early returns.

**Today’s Bullish Activity**

Leading the point gainers list this morning is **Tech Data Corp. (TECD + $13.15 to $124.49)** on a report that the IT equipment distributor received a $5B (or $130/share) buyout offer from private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC. However, there is no certainty that any deal will occur or that Tech Data will engage in negotiations, according to sources close to the matter. Calls are outnumbering puts better than 3:1 with the November 15th 115.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 206).

Multiple high-profile names are moving higher following upbeat earnings announcements:

* **Bank of America Corp. (BAC + $0.70 to $30.43):** The financial services giant reported Q3 earnings of $0.75 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.07 beat) on revenue that increased 0.3% year-over-year to $22.95B (above the $22.73B expected) as net interest yields declined 4 basis points to 2.41% year-over-year. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with the October 18th 30.50 call topping the most actives list (volume is 29,681).
* **Sleep Number Corp. (SNBR + $2.64 to $49.50):** The mattress maker reported Q3 earnings of $0.94 per share ($0.15 beat) on revenue that increased 14.5% year-over-year to $474.78M (above the $462.06M expected) as comparable same-store increased 10% year-over-year. Additionally, the company raised the lower end of its full-year 2019 EPS guidance to $2.45-2.75 (from $2.35-2.75) on revenue that is expected to be “up as much as 10%”. Calls are slightly outnumbering puts with the October 18th 46.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 673).
* **United Airlines Holdings Inc. (UAL + $1.72 to $89.60):** The airliner reported Q3 earnings of $4.07 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.11 beat) on revenue that increased 3.4% year-over-year to $11.38B (below the $11.43B expected) as consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) increased 1.7% year-over-year. Looking ahead, the company raised full-year 2019 EPS guidance to a range of $11.25-12.25 from $10.50-12.00 (and vs. the $11.86 consensus estimate). Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the January 202092.50 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 7,742).

New 52-week highs (53 new highs today): **Arconic Inc. (ARNC - $0.14 to $27.72), Celgene Corp. (CELG + $0.18 to $101.13), Deere &amp; Company (DE + $0.83 to $173.47), Lennar Corp. (LEN + $0.77 to $60.50), Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW + $4.83 to $563.72)**

**Notable Call Activity**

Shares of **Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH + $1.68 to $49.58)** are trading higher on a Wall Street Journal report that it, along with McKesson and Amerisourcebergen, are in talks with state and local governments to settle thousands of opioid lawsuits for $18B and option traders are taking note. CAH calls are outpacing puts 10:1 with all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts being calls. The most actively traded contract is the October 18th 50.00 call as volume is 3,003 versus open interest of 450, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The activity on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various prices, including a 1,347 block that was bought for $0.90 when the bid/ask spread was $0.60 x $1.25, which suggests bullish intent.  

Also seeing some heavy call activity (\~7:1 over puts) is **Morgan Stanley Inc. (MS + $0.32 to $42.85)** as option traders primarily target the June 2020 57.50 call. Volume on this contract is 29,854 (vs. open interest of 203) which mostly consisted of a two 13.43K blocks that were bought (around the same time) at the ask price of $0.25. We know these blocks are new positions given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trades took place at the ask price. The positioning comes ahead of the company’s Q3 earnings report which is scheduled to be released tomorrow morning.

**Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. (AJRD + $1.26 to $48.95):** Call volume is dominating (\~100:1 over puts) which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 55.00 call. Volume on this contract is 9,131 (vs. open interest of 208) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought for between $0.60-0.70 each (suggesting bullish intent).  

**Today’s Bearish Activity** 

Falling to a 10-month low this morning is **Workday Inc. (WDAY - $22.06 to $158.90)** following the company’s Analyst Day, which revealed moderating subscription growth, and multiple brokerage price targets cut. RBC said that Workday’s subscription growth is dropping to the mid 20%’s from 30% as the company penetrates large accounts and lowered their price target to $212.00 from $225.00 while Stifel cut their price target to $180.00 from $210.00. WDAY average implied volatility is up to 41% from yesterday’s 33% closing level. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 4:3 with the October 18th 162.50 call leading the way (volume is 2,607). *Note: the average implied volatility represents an estimated value for a 30-day implied volatility at the current underlying price, based on a curve fit of option implied volatilities.* 

Other cloud-related stocks following WDAY lower include:

* **Coupa Software Inc. (COUP - $13.43 to $141.26):** Shares of COUP bounced off the 50-day SMA ($140.57) earlier in the session; calls are outnumbering puts 3:2 with the November 15th 180.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 1,077).
* **Service Now Inc. (NOW - $18.90 to $255.34):** Shares of NOW briefly dipped below the 200-day SMA ($252.54) but appeared to have found some bid support there, at least at the time of this writing; NOW also got a downgrade to “Equal-Weight” from “Overweight” at Morgan Stanley this morning; puts are slightly outnumbering calls with the January 2020 290.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 1,132).
* **Slack Technologies Inc. (WORK - $1.61 to $23.11):** WORK also got a price target cut (from $38.00 to $28.00) from Morgan Stanley this morning; puts are outnumbering calls roughly 2:1 with the November 15th 25.00 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 7,385).

Also trading to the downside is **ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML - $7.22 to $260.32)** after the semiconductor equipment maker reported Q3 earnings of €1.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items (€0.04 beat) on revenue that increased 7.6% year-over-year to €2.99B (below the €3.03B expected) as gross margins came in at 43.7% (vs. guidance of 43-44%). In terms of guidance, the company said it expects Q4 revenue to be \~€3.9B, which is below the €3.93B consensus estimate. Puts are slightly outnumbering calls with the October 18th 260.00 put leading the way (volume is 339).

New 52-week lows (44 new lows today): **ICU Medical Inc. (ICUI + $2.28 to $154.67), National Presto Industries Inc. (NPK + $0.84 to $83.19), Shotspotter Inc. (SSTI - $0.65 to $18.90)**

**Notable Put Activity**

Some unusual put activity (\~21:1 over calls) is being seen in **Coty Inc. (COTY - $0.02 to $10.36)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 11.00 put. Volume on this contract is 5,077 (vs. open interest of 4,389), which mostly consisted of a 4,607 block that was bought for $1.09 when the bid/ask spread was $1.04 x $1.10. We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread. Note: COTY is scheduled to report fiscal Q1 earnings on November 6th before the market open.

**Baker Hughes Co. (BHGE - $0.03 to $22.27):** Puts are outpacing calls roughly 80:1 which is predominately due to a couple of large blocks that traded on the November 19.00 put (volume is 4,605 vs. open interest of 40) – a 1,720 block was bought at the ask price of $0.15 and (around the same time a 2,580 block traded for $0.10, directly in the middle of the $0.05 x $0.15 bid/ask spread.  

**Volume Signals** 

**Floor &amp; Décor Holdings Inc. (FND - $0.32 to $46.50):** Option volume is running at roughly 30x the daily average of 214 contracts which is primarily being driven by a 4,741 block that was bought on the November 15th 50.00 put at the ask price of $5.30 (open interest is 120). We know this block is a new position based on the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader believes that FND will close below the break-even price of $44.70 at expiration. Note: FND is scheduled to report Q3 earnings on November 1st before the market open.

**Michaels Companies Inc. (MIK + $0.09 to $9.67):** Option volume is running at roughly 14x the daily average of 1,382 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 12.50 call. Volume on this contract is 12,723 (vs. open interest of 125) which mostly consisted of an 8K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.20. We know this block is a new position based on the open interest figure and we can assume that the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

**Gauging Volatility**

The **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 0.43 to 13.97)** has been in the green day all day today (intraday range is 13.60-14.26) as equity markets are in negative territory around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 16, SPX - 7, COMPX - 32).

"Buy $CCI Puts, Insider View","TLDR: Buy CCI puts before the 10/16 earnings call, T-Mobile is one of their biggest revenue streams and stopped leasing new towers until after the Sprint merger which is delayed. 

Long time degenerate first time poster, I work for a hedge fund that focuses on telecom so I follow the tower industry very closely. 

The big tower companies are American Tower, Crown Castle, and SBA Communications. Crown Castle is the first to release its earnings report this quarter so the best chance to take advantage. The way these companies make money is by building cell towers and leasing space on the towers for cell equipment to the big four (AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint). The big four need these towers because the signal goes further when it is high in the air allowing us to buy FD's from our phones but they do not build their own towers, they lease them. 

Crown Castle is one of the largest tower builders and T-Mobile is one of their largest clients, however, due to delays in the merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has announced that it will not be ordering any new tower builds or leasing any new space on towers until the merger is over. This means Crown Castle has effectively lost one of its biggest clients for the last quarter and the near future. This hasn't been reflected in the stock price yet so the earnings report and guidance should send this thing down 5 to 10%.

Morning Briefing (10/15/2019),"# Futures higher amid earnings season kickoff

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade eight points, or 0.3%, above fair value as the Q3 earnings-reporting season gets underway with a set of mostly positive results from four Dow components. 

**JPMorgan Chase** (**JPM** 118.75, +2.30, +2.0%), **Johnson &amp; Johnson** (**JNJ** 133.00, +2.28, +1.7%), and **United Health** (**UNH** 224.17, +3.58, +1.6%) each beat earnings estimates, but **Goldman Sachs** (**GS** 202.50, -3.32, -1.6%) came up shy of expectations. Goldman Sachs did beat revenue estimates, though, with JNJ and UNH providing upside FY19 guidance. 

The earnings news has outweighed a report from *Bloomberg News* indicating that China will struggle to buy $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump removes retaliatory tariffs already placed on Chinese imports. As part of the first phase of a trade deal, China agreed to purchase $40-50 billion in agricultural products.

Morning Briefing (10/14/2019),"# Futures lower on lingering trade deal concerns

U.S. equity futures trade modestly lower to begin the new week with S&amp;P 500 futures hovering seven points below fair value.

Friday's announcement about a partial trade deal being reached with China invited speculation about how much was really accomplished. To that point, Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials are not willing to sign the ""phase one"" deal without more discussions. President Trump, however, has already pushed back, saying that China will immediately increase its purchases of agricultural products from the U.S. and that the phase one deal can be finalized and signed soon.

Markets in Europe trade in negative territory, pressured in part by renewed concerns about the likelihood of a Brexit deal being reached.

Participants will not receive any economic data today and the bond market is closed for Columbus Day.

The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% at 98.46 while crude oil is down 2.0% at $53.60/bbl.

Japan's Nikkei was closed for Health-Sports Day.

Instagram's ($FB) new Threads app is a failure. Buy Snapchat ($SNAP).,"Three days ago I made a post that said, ""Instagram's new Threads app was an insta-flop.""
Yesterday, [Business Insider pointed out the same.](https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-threads-app-sees-low-downloads-compared-to-igtv-boomerang-2019-10) 

Snapchat took a really hard hit because of the release of Threads. Now that it looks like Threads is a bigger disappointment than us, expect an analyst or two to increase their thoughts on Snapchat. This is Facebook's upteenth attempt to take Snapchat out of the running, but it looks like Snapchat is here to stay. It's like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. 

Moreover, Snapchat's stock price took another big hit recently when it was reported that they had server issues two days ago. Last time this happened it reached $17 (Average Analyst Price) after a few days. It now sits at $14.22.

Today’s play,"Alright guys here’s my game plan for today I purposely got out of all my positions yesterday in order to have as much money in cash. After yesterday’s reports I could tell it was bullish so I bought some 270 spy calls expiring today at .30 only bought 10 contracts and sold them at 1.5 today. As soon as I sold them I bought 10 Nov 30 spy puts at 3.70. I go with shorter positions when there’s a lot of risk. However, I’m waiting for a higher push. 

The market just came back down which makes sense because if we get a partial deal it should fly 40-50 points which would put it around the ATH. The market shouldn’t break with a partial deal however, we should be seeing a possible break if it happens. To account for this I have placed a few orders, that will go through if it goes up to the ath levels. Looking to get in on some 2900 Nov EOM /ES at around $25-$27. I’m only going to use about a third of my non-forex account for this. From there I’m going to be looking for a break below the daily 20MA which is when I will go all in on puts meaning out the entirety of my non-forex account in!

I know this is wall street bets, but if this works it’s still over a 100% gain. Honestly, I’m enjoying trading options more than trading futures and stocks directly. Psychologically I’m holding my positions longer, and cutting my losses quicker.",maid113,1570810576,1,2,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dghfjk/todays_play/
$SPY bubble guys don't be stupid,"IF there is a small deal, it will be with Soybeans, which makes up only 1 S&amp;P 500 company (number 239).[Archer\_Daniels\_Midland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_Daniels_Midland) that only has a [weight of 0.090941 on the S&amp;P](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500)

So if the only deal is China Buys Soybeans to delay the new tariffs this month, then $SPY will drop by Monday, because nothing has changed. $ADM will go up $SPY will go down

As far as I'm concerned, the last 6months, SPY hasn't breached 300 by much and not very long.

This is a bubble, it will pop after the China trade deal is revealed as a shit deal to buy some soy for delayed tariffs.

Major European indices are trading higher across the board, rallying in response to President Trump having characterized yesterday's trade negotiations with China as going ""very, very good."" In addition, the idea that the UK could strike a Brexit deal with the EU before the October 31 deadline has also boosted sentiment. That thought has percolated following some upbeat comments from Ireland's prime minister after he met with UK Prime Minister Johnson. The British pound is reflecting this hope, as it has surged nearly 2.0% against the dollar in early action. An upbeat preliminary Q3 report from German software giant SAP has offered another boost to sentiment. Investors largely looking past a pop in oil prices tied to reports that an Iranian oil tanker was hit by missiles in the Red Sea.

Morning Briefing (10/10/2019),"# Trade talk concerns weigh once again

The S&amp;P 500 futures currently trade six points, or 0.2%, below fair value in a volatile overnight session. Futures dropped as much as 1.1% below fair value on a report that deputy-level trade talks have yielded no progress on structural issues or on freezing additional tariff increases, but futures have mostly recovered amid a myriad of related trade headlines. 

The primary report was attributed to the *South China Morning Post*, which also said that the Chinese delegation could leave earlier than expected. The White House reportedly denied this report to *CNBC*, but then clarified that some officials may leave early. *Bloomberg* is reporting that a partial trade deal could include a previously agreed currency agreement. 

One takeaway is that the trade situation is always changing (expect more headlines), and the market will know more concrete details as soon as senior-level discussions begin today. Another takeaway is that although deputy officials are not final decision makers, the negative-sounding headline was enough to sour the mood after yesterday's trade-relief rally. 

On the data front, investors will receive the Consumer Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 218,000) and Continuing Claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield are both unchanged at 1.46% at 1.59%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 98.73. WTI crude is up 0.2%, or $0.10, to $52.68/bbl. 

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **Delta Air Lines** (DAL 52.50, -1.42): -2.6% despite beating earnings estimates. The midpoint of its Q4 EPS guidance was below consensus, though. 
* **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond** (BBBY 12.07, +2.13): +21.4% after naming Mark Tritton as its new CEO. Mr. Tritton was most recently Exec VP and Chief Merchandising Officer at **Target** (TGT 109.50, -0.86, -0.8%). 
* **Cisco Systems** (CSCO 45.98, -0.86): -1.8% after the stock was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman Sachs with a price target of $48. 
* **NetApp** (NTAP 49.25, -2.12): -4.1% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Buy at Goldman Sachs with a price target of $45. 

Reviewing overnight developments:

* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday on a mixed note, with markets in Japan and China finishing higher. Japan's Nikkei +0.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng +0.1%, China's Shanghai Composite +0.8%, India's Sensex -0.8%, South Korea's Kospi -0.9%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.1%.
   * In economic data:
      * Japan's August Core Machinery Orders -2.4% m/m (expected -2.5%; last -6.6%); -14.5% yr/yr (expected -10.8%; last 0.3%). September Bank Lending +2.0% yr/yr (expected 2.1%; last 2.1%). September PPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%; last -0.3%); -1.1% yr/yr (expected -1.2%; last -0.9%). October Reuters Tankan Index -5 (last -7)
      * Australia's August Home Loans +1.8% m/m (expected 3.6%; last 5.0%)
      * New Zealand's September Food Price Index 0.0% m/m (last 0.7%)
   * In news:
      * Risk sentiment was pressured by a report from South China Morning Post, which indicated that no progress was made in deputy-level talks in Washington.
      * CNBC later reported that the Chinese delegation will stay in Washington through Friday, but that was countered by a report from Fox Business, which claimed that the Chinese delegation will leave the U.S. after today's talks.

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday on a mixed note, with markets in Japan and China finishing higher. However, the gains did not come without volatility. Risk sentiment was pressured by a report from *South China Morning Post*, which indicated that no progress was made in deputy-level talks in Washington. *CNBC* later reported that the Chinese delegation will stay in Washington through Friday, but that was countered by a report from *Fox Business*, which claimed that the Chinese delegation will leave the U.S. after today's talks. *Bloomberg* reported this morning that the U.S. may include a currency pact with China in a partial trade deal. South Korea's largest hedge fund reportedly suspended redemptions from some of its funds.

Major European indices trade near their flat lines. British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is meeting with the Irish leader today to discuss potential alternatives for the Irish backstop. Meanwhile, Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, reportedly supports calling a general election on November 26 if Brexit gets delayed once again. European Central Bank policymaker, Olli Rehn, said that reports about the level of disagreement among ECB officials have been exaggerated. EU finance ministers have agreed to a eurozone budget of EUR17 bln, which is well below the amount that was discussed in the past. The budget will be used to fund investment and reforms.

There are analysts saying no deal brexit would tank the British economy in ways almost at 2008 recession levels.

Analyst Report
EWU offers investors exposure to the European market of the United Kingdom by investing in securities that trade on the national stock exchange of the nation. Since many of the large caps in this fund are likely to be found in other EFA holdings, the fund is not appropriate for investors seeking broad diversification across Europe.

For investors looking for high levels of exposure to the British market in particular, EWU is probably the best 'pure play' option available.

Options are relatively cheap, though the option volume is relatively low. For people that are out of the loop on forex, this is probably the best way to play brexit with play the pound sterling itself.

2.  Drivers are too dumb to understand they are not actually making any money.  The depreciation and expenses they incur outpace their earnings.  If they were smart, they would incorporate and find favorable tax treatment.

3.  UBER’s insurance company just fired them.  Imagine having one client that is like 20% of all your revenue.  And you fired them because they “were not meeting your profit expectations.”  That CEO has an ass raping coming.  And other firms will follow.

* Modern Warfare 3 sold 27M copies. That was in 2011 (god I feel old). The CoD series has not seen a true modern-day shooter in a decade. The futuristic genre has been exhausted, and I view the move to more contemporary themes as a big positive on the stock
* Fortnite mania seems to finally be cooling off. BOIII saw limited success because it dropped right around the peak of Fortnite's popularity.

Morning Briefing (10/9/2019),"# Partial trade deal optimism boosting markets

U.S. futures are up nicely on news that China is interested in reaching a partial trade deal with the U.S. The S&amp;P 500 futures trade 25 points, or 0.9%, above fair value. 

An unnamed official with direct knowledge of the talks told *Bloomberg* that terms would include President Trump not imposing any additional tariffs, including the increase in tariff rates next week and in December. Beijing would offer to buy more agricultural products in exchange without addressing any structural trade issues. The *Financial Times* reported that soybean purchases could increase by 10 million tons annually. 

Walking out of the 13th round of trade talks without resolving any core issues and keeping tariff rates unchanged seems underwhelming compared to the complete deal that President Trump has been wanting. Nevertheless, there was some angst yesterday about those tariff-rate hikes taking effect this year.

Today's economic calendar will feature the minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, which will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET. Wholesale Inventories for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) and the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for August will precede the minutes at 10:00 a.m. ET.

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a modestly higher note. China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain. The index rallied to begin the day but backed off its session high after the release of a weaker than expected Caixin Services PMI (actual 51.3; expected 52.1; last 52.1). Overnight reports indicated that U.S. officials added 28 Chinese companies, including Hikvision, to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. Samsung issued better than expected guidance for Q3.

Morning Briefing (10/7/2019),"# Stock market slumps on trade talk uncertainties

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade eight points, or 0.3%, below fair value after a volatile week of trading last week left the benchmark index little changed. Futures have wavered in negative territory all session but are currently trading near their highs while investors digest a batch of weekend news. 

On the trade front, *Bloomberg* reported that China is more reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal and is not committed on reforming Chinese industrial policy or government subsidies. President Trump's call for China to investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could also complicate talks, according to *The New York Times*. High-level trade talks will resume in Washington on Thursday and Friday.

Separately, labor talks between the UAW and **General Motors** (**GM** 34.80, -0.11, -0.3%) have taken ""a turn for the worse,"" and a second whistleblower has come forth against President Trump. Although not market-moving, the negative-sounding news may be contributing to the general sense of uncertainty in the market. 

U.S. Treasuries have edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.41%, and the 10-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.54%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.87. WTI crude is up 1.3%, or $0.66, to $53.47/bbl.

Today's economic data will be limited to the Consumer Credit report for August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 billion) at 3:00 p.m. ET.

* **General Motors** (GM 34.80, -0.11): -0.3% amid news that labor talks with the UAW have ""taken a turn for the worse.""
* **First Solar** (FSLR 62.74, +3.43): +5.8% after the Trump administration removed tariff exemptions for bifacial solar panels. These products will be subject to a 25% tariff rate starting on Oct. 28. First Solar will regain an edge against foreign competitors, according to *Bloomberg.*

ATVI Pt. 3: THE CANCELLED PRE-ORDER,"*TL:DR: ATVI Finna get REKT this month see spoonfed trades at the bottom.*

**We're going to jump right into it.** [**Previous thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cti6rb/classic_wow_the_numbers_atvi_50_incoming/)

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

So ATVI hit 55$, earnings season is dropping soon and Modern Warfare is all over the internet in beta.

**First off Let's talk Classic Wow:**

Classic Wow is and was about as successful as I expected before blizzard cut the API supporting the census addons it was looking like more than 3 million subs were added. That's a lot of dough but just as I thought 2 weeks in majority of my friends who were dying of excitement to raid talking about how they were going to rule azeroth dropped off in the level 20's. The game is just way too hard and time-consuming for your average gamer nowadays, I estimate they will keep a solid 2 million subscriptions for the first 6 months and that it will stabilize in the 500k-1Mil range.

**Overall, it was a great success** 

They just made probably close to 100 million dollars re-launching a game over a decade old. The game is just a passive income drip to the exec's now and it is likely to forever remain that. I don't think they're going to fuck this up it'll be around for years now and likely we'll see talk of a BC classic server in a few years from now. Not to mention a TON of people went over to BFA after realizing they like WoW but actually are casual scrubs now that want to play retail.

**So why do I think they're about to get rekt? 1 word COD**

I bought Modern Warfare pre-order, I was super hyped all the footage and interviews were touting a game that was actually a genuine revival of the cult-classic and people were actually calling it the best COD they've ever played. Flash forward to today and I've canceled my pre-order as of a week ago. 

**The shitstorm is coming Randy...**

I follow a decent selection of youtube gaming commenters, this gives me a complete picture of the ""buzz"" in gaming circles and right now ALL OF THEM, are dropping videos about modern warfare and activisions decision to literally lock out an entire mode from PC &amp; XBOX for a year. Personally, when I heard the news I instantly canceled my pre-order not because I didn't enjoy the game, **DEADASS it was the best cod I have ever played in my entire life period.**

**Me and a metric-fuck-ton of gamers have drawn a line in the sand with these AAA publishers though.**

This is not going to fly and the PR backlash is going to be insane, KEEP IN MIND THIS IS GOOD FOR US. The stock price is going to drop in response to the wave of hate that is coming their way and I haven't even started talking about the lootboxes which are going to contain exclusive weapons **i.e. actual pay to win.**

**If you remember the EA battlefront 2 fiasco over lootboxes, just know if ATVI doesn't stand down this is WORSE.**

Gamers are fucking tired of lootboxes, we don't give a shit if you want to charge us for skins we will gladly pay for them as evident by the many skins I own in a wide variety of games. The major difference here is the Gambling randomness, NO ONE except the whales likes the idea of boxes containing actual weapons that can give you an advantage over other players even if just statistical. This shit is going to prematurely-bukkake all over their faces like a room full of sweaty Japanese nerds on their first day shooting porn.

\_\_\_\_\_

**""Okay, that was a lot of Sweaty DD where are the tendies?""**

Earnings will release, the numbers will show low and be-hold literally nothing the internet says matters because Stacy is going to buy her son Call of Duty anyway it's the only fucking game she knows the name of, big fucking surprise.

Price will spike on the amazing sales report from COD &amp; WoW &amp; All the other parts of ATVI that no one knows are really producing them money like fucking candy crush. **The investors don't give a flying fuck what some salty gamers think, but they do follow the news, bad news scares them, good numbers make them happy.**

**Spoonfed Trades:**

ATVI stock price will drop in response to the backlash coming in the next few weeks,

**Buy puts ASAP if you are Bear gang.**

*Nov. 8th 2019, 50$ Put's* &lt;- ^(I won't be buying any of these as I don't fuck with puts my testicles are rather minuscule.)

**FUCKING NOTE: ONLY when ATVI is at 50$ or lower do I suggest buying back in.**

The price will then stagnate until earnings a few weeks later this is the time to **buy calls if you are Bull gang.**

Feb, 21, 2020 60$ Calls &lt;-^(After the PR shock to the Activision price, these will be dirt fucking cheap.)

Morning Briefing (10/4/2019),"# Futures lower as investors await Employment Situation Report

U.S. equity futures are down this morning, as investors take a cautious stance in front of the Employment Situation Report for September at 8:30 a.m. ET. The S&amp;P 500 futures trade eight points, or 0.3%, below fair value following a volatile start to the month. 

Given the disappointing data from the ISM this week, the employment report will be scrutinized for any signs of slowing in the labor market. The Briefing.com consensus is projecting 150,000 nonfarm payrolls added to the U.S. economy, which would be a slight acceleration from August, with average hourly earnings up 0.3% and the unemployment rate unchanged at 3.7%.

The Trade Balance report for August (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) will be released concurrently with the jobs report. 

In other employment news, **HP** (**HPQ** 17.29, -1.11, -6.0%) announced it will cut its global headcount by approximately 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. Elsewhere, Fed Chair Powell will deliver the opening remarks at a Fed event about maximum employment and price stability at 2:00 p.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries are little changed in front of the jobs data. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.76. WTI crude is up 0.3%, or $0.14, to 52.59/bbl.

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **Apple** (AAPL 223.58, +2.76): +1.3% after *The Nikkei Asian Review* reported Apple advised its suppliers to increase production for its iPhone 11 by 10%. 
* **Costco** (COST 284.01, -4.99): -1.7% despite beating earnings estimates. 
* **HP** (HPQ 17.29, -1.11): -6.0% after announcing it will cut its global headcount by approximately 7,000 to 9,000 employees.

Market is rallying on data showing economy is about to fail (DD),"Please don't fool yourselves with this last hour rally! It's a trap by the market makers to curb stomp those a little late on joining 🐻 BEAR GANG 🐻  so they can squeeze out more profits with another big red candle when you foolishly sell your puts for a big loss and buy into their overpriced call FDs.   


Here is why:   
Tuesday: ISM PMI report released showing 47.8  !! This is nothing but a massive contraction in the manufacturing industry. Literally the lowest it's been in 10 years. 

Wednesday:  ADP Non-Farm employment change released showing 135k vs a previous 157k (revised from 195k aka they fooled everyone last month) This basically forecasts Friday's unemployment report / job-report is going to be shit. 

Thursday: ISM Non-manufacture PMI numbers once again worse than expected... Forecasting a slowdown economic growth of US

Yet markets went up today? Hmm, that's because people are saying rate cut probability is more likely given all this bad data, go figure, betting on the FED to save us, yet in their last meeting, they were conflicted about if we need further cuts! (look it up, many didn't support further cuts)

&amp;#x200B;

To top it all off, we have weak earnings season coming up, uncertainty with the president, and trade has yet to get any better. 

The market is going to likely bleed this year some more as we are still sitting only 1-2% off ATHs! Don't be fooled...",Boneyg001,1570143046,84,55,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dcymyr/market_is_rallying_on_data_showing_economy_is/
Fuckkkk Apple,"Ok, here it goes...

Apple WAS a great company. In a tech market shrouded in mystery, they seemed to pull back the curtain with their sleek design and simple user interface. They made tech that seemed super complicated, accessible to everyone. It was easy to use, and even when it wasn't they had great support staff (geniuses) to help explain what was going on and solve what seemed to be the most complicated problems. They dominated the tech market for a while. That is, until everything changed when the GREAT ONE left us.

Once Robo-CEO, Tim Cook took over, the company was never the same. Slowly, their products lost their luster. Over night, Apple seemed to fall behind competitor technology, favoring lighting ports, photo capability and facial recognition over actual improvements to the products. Shit, even their geniuses started to seem retarded, with the only question they are able to answer is whether or not the product is still covered by the warranty. But, by the time consumers realized Apple's products were not what they once were, Apple had cornered the market by transitioning into a service based company.

Apple somehow managed to get everyone's most personal information uploaded to the iCloud – credit card info, books, music libraries (that you spent hours building out), and all your photos. Now, consumers are held hostage by a services company that won't fix their products in favor of keeping you on their services while managing to get you to buy their ""new"" products every two years. This was a fine business model for the most part. Even though consumers aren't happy, they are held hostage because they don't want to migrate all their data or learn new user interfaces. All Apple had to do was keep doing what they're doing and keep a chokehold on the market (the customers).

This is where Robo-CEO Tim Cook really fucked up. He got caught up in the streaming services race. He decided it would be a good idea to sell apple products with a free one year subscription to their streaming services to build subscribers as quick as possible. Apple essentially won't see any profit from their streaming service, but instead will boast high subscriber numbers even though they're not making any money off them. They essentially put all their eggs in one basket anticipating that subscribers will be too lazy/uninterested in canceling their Apple TV subscription.

For this plan to work, one of two things needs to happen. 1) The content on Apple TV needs to be great enough to maintain subscribers, and 2) Apple needs to hope that it maintains a positive image in public perception.

There are fundamental problems with both of those. Addressing #1, Apple decide to enter a market in which it has 0 experience in. In fact, even worse, Apple entered a market where, unlike technology, every person tends to consider themselves experts in spotting good content. With technology, there is a reason that ""geniuses"" are necessary, because it's complicated. The lay-person doesn't understand back-end coding, or how a data processor interacts with a graphics card. But the lay-person does understand what is good content and what isn't. There's a reason why the Academy Awards is given a primetime viewer spot and why you read about Tech Crunch Disrupt in a magazine. Hell, people even have Oscar parties where they try and guess what will be given the award for it's respective category. I highly doubt that Apple, who has never made content before, will be able to compete with the content that is created by Disney +, HBO Max, Amazon Prime, or Netflix.

Addressing #2, Apple positioned themselves to be hurt by their own consumer base. By offering the subscription for a whole year for free, if their consumers feel they are being treated unfairly they can all unsubscribe and Apple won't see any revenue from their streaming service. While in the past, the likelihood of consumer mutiny seemed unlikely. In today's day and age, it seems anything as small as ignoring a customer is grounds for a class action law-suit. That doesn't bode well for a company that is making a large portion of their money by telling their consumers to fuck off and pay for the newest product. We've seen small instances impact whole corporations before, just look at Starbucks. They had to close down their stores to retrain every employee. The likelihood that a small instance like this doesn't happen are slim, especially considering how many locations they have. Hell, all it takes is one corporate sexual harassment lawsuit and it's a twitter campaign boycotting all Apple products.

All Apple is trying to do with this subscription deal is buy themselves time. They are buying themselves time so that they can learn how to develop content like the studios who have been there for almost half a century before them. All it takes is one mis step, one bad tweet from 2008 to set this dumpster on fire.

Long Story Short: Apple put all their eggs in one streaming service basket and opened themselves up to be harmed by their own consumer base with the way that they decided to roll out their streaming service.

Morning Briefing (10/3/2019),"# Futures drifting ahead of more U.S. economy data

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade five points, or 0.2%, below fair value after two straight drops in the stock market, while investors look ahead to more data on the U.S. economy. 

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 55.4) will give investors a closer look inside the services sector, which is the largest segment of the economy. That report will be released at 10:00 a.m. ET. In Europe, participants received a set of mostly weaker-than-expected Services PMI readings, although the Europe Stoxx 600 is down just 0.1%. 

Investors will also receive the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET and the Factory Orders report for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%) at 10:00 a.m. ET. 

Separately, the USTR confirmed it will levy $7.5 billion in tariffs on EU aircraft at 10% and dairy/agricultural products at 25% beginning Oct. 18. The decision comes after the WTO gave the U.S. permission to do so yesterday after years of EU subsidies to Airbus. Shares of Airbus SE are up 3% in European trading. 

U.S. Treasuries are up again, pushing yields even lower this morning. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.98. WTI crude trades flat at $52.64/bbl. 

In U.S. Corporate news:

Investors will also receive the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET and the Factory Orders report for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%) at 10:00 a.m. ET. 

Separately, the USTR confirmed it will levy $7.5 billion in tariffs on EU aircraft at 10% and dairy/agricultural products at 25% beginning Oct. 18. The decision comes after the WTO gave the U.S. permission to do so yesterday after years of EU subsidies to Airbus. Shares of Airbus SE are up 3% in European trading. 

U.S. Treasuries are up again, pushing yields even lower this morning. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.98. WTI crude trades flat at $52.64/bbl.

Getting Technical: SPY DD(10/2/19),"Drill Spy the Buy Puts Guy here with some technical analysis on $SPY in preparation for Wedneaday, October 2nd. 

*Safety glasses on*
.
On October 1st, $SPY(-1.19%) saw it's biggest one day drop in over a month off of weak manufacturing news.  President Tariff Man's outlook on trade talks has changed to a much more negative tone the past few tweets, and it seems the impeachmeant news has him thrown off his stonks game. 

    If he can regain his focus and use his tweets to pump efficiently, we may see SPY rebound by the EOW, but as of now, he seems more focused on attempted pumps on auto stocks nobody gives a fuck about. Unless Trump regains his true bull self, expect SPY to continue it's downtrend for the week considering there has been literally zero positive political or economic news this week. In other words, the stock market is ON FUCKING FIRE. 

As for October 2nd, look for $SPY  to rally at open. If it breaks 294.25 early, expect a flat-to-mildly green day, before a big drop the rest of the week. On the opposite side, if we break through 293.00 on the downside, expect all hell to break loose and $SPY to close around 290. 

In conclusion, barring Tariff man going full Bull Gang, expect another red day tomorrow because there is absolutely no fucking reason for a green day at all. Buy puts motherfuckers cause SPY is gonna DRILL! DRILL! DRILL!

*Safety Glasses off*

TLDR: $SPY is gonna DRILL! DRILL! DRILL! tomorrow. Buy puts it is free fucking money.",GramsOfLoud,1569991556,25,38,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dc5ix3/getting_technical_spy_dd10219/

The Commission Wars,"There is a major chance robinhood gets bought for pennies on the dollar for their assets and data after a bidding war between brokerage firms. There is also a chance they fail as a firm and you’ll have to go through the hassle of making a claim through SIPC. If you have over 500k in assets, I would move that now.

Now as for the bidding war, as I’ve already discussed with Robinhood, I think E-trade is also gonna be up for merger talks here very soon. I have no idea what will happen with broker stocks tomorrow, but I suspect we’ll start to see merger talks with some smaller firms like tasty trade and some of the bigger firms tomorrow.

Pfizer,"Pfizer recently purchased a pharmaceutical plant in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Retrofitted the plant site spending a huge amount of money in hopes of a quick turn around.


They have been having the hardest time producing products that can be sold for human consumption.
Many batches have had lidocaine contamination, and the problem has been ongoing for months, undiagnosed. This means that they haven’t sold anything produced here for quite some time.

On top of this, the plant has just had an evacuation today due to a suspected chlorine gas leak.
Chlorine is highly reactive and would also likely render any exposed products unmarketable.

Pfizer is a huge company, and this is just one plant site, but there are rumors of the company having to sell the facility less than 5 years after acquisition. If that makes headlines I’d imagine there would be repercussions for stock price.

Morning Briefing (9/30/2019),"# Stocks poised to start the week on higher note

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade nine points, or 0.3%, above fair value on the last day of September and third quarter. Futures are rebounding from last week's decline after the White House downplayed news that it was considering restricting U.S. investment into China. 

Specifically, U.S. Treasury spokesperson Monica Crowley said over the weekend that the Trump administration was ""not contemplating blocking Chinese companies from listing on US exchanges at this time."" The statement came after *Bloomberg News* reported on Friday that this was one method the White House was looking at to restrict flows into China. 

The news may be providing some relief for investors this morning. Elsewhere, stocks in China closed mostly lower on Monday, even as data showed a slight improvement in manufacturing activity for September. China's Shanghai Composite declined 0.9% and will be closed the rest of the week in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. 

Back on the home front, economic data will be limited to the Chicago PMI for September (Briefing.com consensus 50.8), which will be released at 9:45 a.m. ET. Looking ahead to the rest of the week, key reports will include the ISM Manufacturing Index for September on Tuesday and the Employment Situation Report for September on Friday.

U.S. Treasuries have edged lower, bringing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.27. WTI crude is down 1.1%, or $0.60, to $55.31/bbl. 

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **Newell Brands** (NWL 18.88, +0.68): +3.7% after the stock was upgraded to Buy from Hold at SunTrust with a price target of $25.

Reminder: Costco is a GROCERY STORE and ONE store in China isn't going to move earnings.,"You should know by now if Jim Cramer and every other dickhead writing articles on Seeking Alpha is telling you to buy calls, the market makers are looking for bagholders. 

Costco puts are trading A LOT higher than calls right now. The SMART money (aka the most money) is betting on an earnings flop. And it will, because here is exactly what is going to happen, in Socratic Dialogue format:

WSB Autist: Costco built a store in China! They're going to build another one soon! Earnings is on October 3rd!!!! I'm going to YOLO $300 calls and beat the market so bad it will look like Rhianna after she talked back to Chris!

Earnings Reality Monster: Costco has 770 stores worldwide, making China's store worth about one-tenth of one percent of revenue. The second store will bring that up to two-tenths of one percent. Idiot.

WSB Autist: Typical bear, you'll see on earnings day, too the moon!

Earnings Reality Monster: No, you will see, we're going to post a beat that won't be what you expected, and revenue will be more or less in line. Guidance will be decent but nothing to write home about.

WSB Autist: But what about China?! There's like a billion people there?!?!

Earnings Reality Monster: We're a fucking grocery store dude. We're not fucking GoPro. Slim margins and guaranteed revenue from selling $50 subs, idiot. 

WSB Autist: But that $2.00 hotdog!!!

Earnings Reality Monster: Oh I get it now, you just really like the store, ah ok. Well I have some OTM calls to sell you for next week. Want some?

PDPM Roll-out on Oct 1st,"Alright,  listen up. On Oct 1st we will be seeing one of the most sweeping changes to Medicare part A reimbursement for therapy services in the last 20 years.  Companies have no idea how this is going to impact their revenue so they are cutting fat right now in preparation.  Gone are the days more therapy more money. Now it's about better results with less therapy.  

How to play.  We should be looking for companies that are contract therapy companies, they will get their revenues hit the most,  nothing will show up yet but over the next few quarters expect to see declines in both top and bottom line growth, with some companies seeing declining revenues.  Companies that own nursing home and rehab facilities may be able weather the storm but I expect some losses over the next few quarters.  

More words than I wanted to type or you fucks will read.  So do some research, if you are long some of these companies keep an eye.  If you have a sac, might be a worth while idea to short or buy some puts on this shit.

Shorting Pepsi on earnings,I am loading up with whatever amount of buying power I have Monday morning on Pepsi puts. My dad was a truck driver for them but one of the Coke managers followed him on his route and asked him to come for an interview since he was efficient. My dad now works for them instead. Apparently this is fairly common as several other people from his plant switched from Pepsi to Coke in the past few months. He told me his manager almost broke down and cried when he told him that he had the Coke job because they were losing so many people and he didn’t know what to do.

EA Calls,Apex Legends is releasing season 3 that includes a new hero and new map. The stock plummeted a couple days after the release of season 2 due to a shitty character and shitty changes to the only map they had. There was a ton of hype for it and became an utter disappointment. I am optimistic we will see a jump in the stock a couple days after the release of S3. Check out the trailer on the PlayApex Twitter. Tuesday will definitely pump on the twitch viewers for apex. Just a though,teqnohh,1569605621,0,32,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/da3q93/ea_calls/

[DD] $ACB - Analyst Rating: YOLO,"Good Afternoon Disciples, 

Today I will DD Aurora Cannabis.  Currently, the stock is trading a 4.75 per share and with \~1B shares outstanding the market cap of the company is $4.75B. By any traditional fundamental this would be an egregious valuation as the company had annual revenue of \~$400MM.  This 10X sales would seem extremely high, except with a 333% CAGR advertised by the company it will only take 3 years for the firms revenue to reach $14B.  (they can produce a gram of pot for $0.9 USD...I think street price is $20...thats a markup)

Aurora Cannabis \[the company\] is a leader in the Canadian market for medical and recreational cannabis.  It is well known among the world that Canadians are nice, and as a result their marijuana is nice as well.  Nice marijuana = a nice high, which is a desirable type of high.  According to the company investor presentations a dynamic growth strategy that involves branding, science, scaling, diversification, cost of production, innovation, distribution, and brands will be used to create this growth.  But more realistically the growth is going to come from acquiring companies.  This is evident in the six year old company already completing 40 acquisitions.  Acquisitions cost money, and since they've already acquired 40 companies I assume this means they have a lot of money, otherwise they may be running our of money.

One risk is that vaping will be banned, but fortunately the company has dry flower,  oils, soft gels, gel caps, edibles, and infused beverages that they can sell, so even though nobody is going to be able to vape any more (lol) the company is able to sell their product through a wide array of markets.  Also, they are committed to finding the best way to get high.  Rumor is that if you shoot the THC into your veins the high can last for up to a month.  

With all things considered I recommend risking it all and buying ACB stock 

s/ncerely

Super complete DD - Recap of KB Homes ER and guidance report,"Here's an outline of ER and guidance and my evaluation of the results:

ER:

* EPS Beat by 7 cents. Expected 0.66 p/s vs. Actual 0.73 p/s
* 1.16B revenue - shy of analyst expected 1.17B
* Community absorption rate increased 23.7% (Meaning availability of homes for sale increased 23.7% to meet demand)
* 90% of homes have experienced price increases to increase future revenues, meet demand, and offset debt.
* $1.8B in debt but a 180M cashflow - Relatively healthy as a result of a $2.3B in backlog (pending orders, etc.)
* KBH planning to continue expansion of neighborhoods and will use revenue towards debt repayment program. 
* 68M net income - Based on numbers below compared to that of last year 2018 3Q.
   * Home Deliveries increased 9.17%
   * Net Home Orders increased 24% Backlogged Orders increased 14$
      * For greater perspective, home deliveries is important for immediate income that is accounted for in the ER.
      * Net Home Orders increase indicates growth in business and growth in demand (as suggested otherwise by people that are NOT in this industry and hearing from the general population of the uninformed)
      * Back log of $2.3B is great for future earnings numbers. 

Guidance:

* Expectations are in line and maintained despite less than stellar performance on the net orders. 
* Company is focused on financial reconciliation to reduce outstanding debt; a proportion of the revenue will be used in a debt repayment program.
* The company expects to be well within positive cash flow by next quarter and are confident that backlogs will start being cleared in the coming quarter and for 2020. 
* Year-over-year gross profit margins and revenues are expected to grow but no expected amount reported; this makes sense with the $2.3B in backlogs that they are prepared to fulfill shortly. 
* Their plans of expansion is also another good sign that the company is positioning for a strong finish to 2019 and 2020. If the company was in financial trouble, as some suggested in the KBH forums, there would not be a focus on expansion nor a solid debt repayment plan or expectation of positive cash flow and definitely not year-over-year revenue growth expectations. 

Hopefully this helps some. I believe this company is still undervalued compared in the industry and compared to that of its major direct competitors.",TripleBrain,1569522624,4,8,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9npu8/super_complete_dd_recap_of_kb_homes_er_and/

Short ATVI!,"Looks like Activision is already back to their scummy practices again and trying to squeeze their latest title that isn’t even out yet - Modern Warfare. Certain game modes have been locked behind a exclusivity wall that is only available to players on the PS4. This is causing a HUGE uproar in the playerbase already and people are cancelling preorders en mass.

Also, loot boxes are confirmed in the game! Expect players to go into an angered frenzy when the game is released and ends up being pay-to-win like black ops. 

We can also expect Activision to also start squeezing players in WoW Classic. Perfect time to load up on puts. This stock is gonna plummet back to low 40s or even 30s!

TL;DR - A lot of people thought Activision was changing grit habits but it looks like they already relapsed to scumbag ethics.",a_small_morkie,1569468089,5,49,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9e0ph/short_atvi/

The Micron Conspiracy $MU,"Disclaimer: I own a few Micron FD’s and 2 $53.5c 9/27 contracts. 

Now, as we all know, the market makers are out to get you. We’re all the herd of 70 year retirees who walk in and out of the casino everyday to play slots knowing damn well they’re gonna lose, but knowing there’s at least a small chance at dying on a yacht. Like this similar tribe, we all do our own research to find systems or plays that we like. And just like a casino, all the ads you see tell you that you’re basically guaranteed to make money.

Additionally, all these bullshit brokerages and market websites talk like they can predict the future. Right now, all the Micron articles I’ve read have been negative about upcoming earnings. Articles like this [one](https://www.benzinga.com/node/14490836) show that they’re gonna shit the bed. But if you’re a reasonable conspiracy theorist like me, you know that the people with the real inside info don’t give it away for free. All this free “information” is meant to manipulate the prices in favor of the real players in the market. 

So, in conclusion, Micron will Moon on earnings because most dumbasses will buy puts written by the market makers.",GamblingMan420,1569451640,40,32,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9arqt/the_micron_conspiracy_mu/

KBH is a Buy. DD Below,"Disclaimer: I am in the real estate/estate development space.

KBH has seen steady growth in it's construction rate in the recent two years. The business is not only profitable, but also a lot of potential left for expansion into southern and northern California (I use CA as a primary example as housing market is most active, attractive, and profitable in this area). 

In previous quarters, KBH has met and exceeded expectations for ER and maintained a steady track to meet all of it's guidance. Granted the previous two quarters, KBH was mostly in it's construction phase and fed mortgage cuts did not take into full effect, the market would not have been ideal - yet, it beat expectations. Currently, we are in the selling phase. I know this. Don't SEC me. If we zoom into CA, KBH has listed over 500 properties across four major cities in the Bay Area. The homes sold out in under a year. Profit margins are not tremendous as space is expensive for development, and cost of materials have also gone up with employment as well - nonetheless, we are talking about 500 properties all within the 800k-1.5M range. This is in the Bay Area in four major cities alone. Other areas I cannot account for, but in CA alone, the revenue is probably tremendous. 

Last note. Please take a look into the Revenue to Market cap ratio. We are looking at a forward REVENUE of 25.52%, meaning higher annual revenue than the market cap. Don't see this a lot with a stock in this value range.",TripleBrain,1569438011,20,80,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d97u6d/kbh_is_a_buy_dd_below/

There is no one running this insane asylum.,"Yesterday news broke that the Democrat party is pushing forward with impeaching President Trump. Some news media outlets were reporting that the prospect of someone like Elizabeth Warren as President caused a sell off in the stock market. This is an EXTREME misdirect! I am surprised that not many people have realised that the stock market sell off is not caused by the correlation of this political event. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve issued a new form of 'Loan' to address problems in the repo market. The federal reserve has committed to injecting $90bn in three $30bn two-week repo operations this week, enabling banks to borrow cash and tide them over the end of the third quarter. Today however, the demand for cash was $62 Billion dollars with only $30 Billion dollars injected. 

Essentially, today is an example of how the liquidity in the market has been drying up to such a point that banks do not have enough cash to meet their end of quarter obligations. The end of the quarter is October 10. The federal reserve has had to issue more money through repo than last week and likely will have to issue much much much more in the future .

It is my thesis that this problem is a direct cause of interest rate policy which is leaving the fed with little firepower to fight a rising divergence in liabilities to assets. With a large amount of sovereign debt (30%) now carrying a negative yield, these bonds themselves become transformed from asset to liability. In addition to this, negative interest rates are explicitly deflationary in nature as less money is repaid than borrowed. Putting two and two together, negative interest rate policy will continue to have a deflationary affect on assets while contributing to a negative feedback loops of rising liabilities in world economy. 

In the face of this, banks are now knowingly holding negative yielding bonds and not selling for a profit as prices have soared. The banks would rather use the fed repo facility for liquidity than sell some liabilities to create assets. This is really not a good sign and surely demonstrates how the federal reserve is losing control of its monetary policy. 

My DD?

 I think the banks refusing to sell treasuries for massive gains is not a good sign because this means that they're scared of something even worse.

All the DD I need to go all in on SPY calls,"Think about it fellow autist....

I put 4 dots, not 3, 4. Im super cereal.

Presidential elections are coming up, and we have ourselves a very interesting situation.

Democrats: they realize that “trump” (Republicans) are winning right now. They say, “hey terry, trump is killing negotiations with China better than anyone else we have, the economy still appears to be doing well even with China imposing tariffs (unlike the inverse, terry, which is China literally sucking **** with our tariffs (bleeped our for the college kids betting student loans)), and things are just fantastic right now here in the good u s of a. Oh, terry, I know how we can win the next presidential election! We have no other choice, let’s convince the majority of the house to vote on a resolution making it clear that we think trump should be impeached! Oh brilliant terry. Just brilliant.”

So yeah... it’s all BS. 

BUT, this things still coming down eventually... tried to clear that top a few times, if this impeachment BS gets rolled over, Republicans will probably win bc no one will think Democrat’s sane enough to run the country.",daytraderz,1569379786,3,3,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d8xbbb/all_the_dd_i_need_to_go_all_in_on_spy_calls/

$SPY Will open green tomorrow,"Already too many democrats have voiced that they will not vote for impeachment. They need a simple majority and if autism servers correctly 435/2 rounding DOWN to 216 for a simple majority is needed. At this moment 50 democrats have said they will not support it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meaning 31 Republicans need to flip sides, which will not happen. This impeachment inquiry is dead in the water, Trump releasing transcripts will pour more cold water on it. Trade war news is still concerning though.

Morning Briefing (9/24/2019),"# Poised for higher start to calm morning

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade 14 points, or 0.5%, above fair value in a relatively quiet pre-market session. Futures, like global stocks, haven't shown much conviction today, although some positive-sounding trade news has aided investor sentiment. 

Specifically, China granted waivers to several companies to buy soybeans from the U.S. without being subject to retaliatory tariffs, according to *Bloomberg*. In addition, some Chinese companies reportedly bought at least 20 cargoes on Monday. 

The encouraging news, coupled with an understanding that the U.S. economy remains resilient and monetary policy remains favorable, has presumably contributed to today's positive bias. 

On the data front, investors will receive the FHFA Housing Price Index for July and the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July (Briefing.com consensus 2.3%) at 9:00 a.m. ET, followed by the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 134.0) at 10:00 a.m. ET.

I called and got my account back with no problem. After checking everything, the stolen account just charged my personal card for one month of Netflix. Then proceeded, to do nothing. They watched no shows, created no new account or new devices. Leading me to believe NFLX knows they are going to miss their subscriber numbers and are hiring 3rd party contractors from India to log into deactivated accounts and reactivate them for one month.

Morning Briefing (9/23/2019),"# Dow futures lower as European PMI data weighs

U.S. equity futures have dipped lower after manufacturing PMI readings out of the eurozone continued to disappoint. The S&amp;P 500 futures trade five points, or 0.2%, below fair value. 

Specifically, the eurozone's flash September Manufacturing PMI declined to 45.6 from 47.0 in August, and Germany's flash Manufacturing PMI fell to 41.4 from 43.5. A reading below 50.0 denotes a contraction. In turn, growth concerns have contributed to the increased demand for U.S. Treasuries, driving yields lower across the curve. 

The 2-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield is down seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.71. WTI crude is down 0.5%, or $0.30, to $57.79/bbl.

In U.S. data, key reports this week will include the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September on Tuesday, New Home Sales for August on Wednesday, and the report for Personal Income and Spending on Friday. The latter report will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index.

Separately, FOMC voting members New York Fed President Williams and St. Louis Fed President Bullard are scheduled to speak at separate events today. Mr. Williams will speak at 9:50 a.m. ET, and Mr. Bullard will speak at 1:00 p.m. ET.

**Asia**: Nikkei CLOSED, Hang Seng -0.8%, Shanghai -1.0%

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region began the week on a mixed note, but overall activity was reduced due to a holiday closure in Japan. Weekend press reports indicated that the Chinese trade delegation cancelled its visit to Montana and other farm states at the request of U.S. officials. On a somewhat related note, *South China Morning Post* reported that imports of pork to China spiked 76% yr/yr to 162,935 tons in August. South Korea's exports through the first 20 days of September were down 21.8% yr/yr with exports of semiconductors falling 39.8% yr/yr. Exports to China contracted 29.8% yr/yr. On the positive side, exports of wireless communication devices increased 58.0%.

Chinese Trade Delegation Called Off Farm Visits at U.S. Request- so why are futures blood red?,"Is it just because I own calls???

From bberg 
China’s cancellation of a planned visit to farms in the American heartland was done at the request of the U.S., people familiar with the matter said, indicating it wasn’t caused by a negative turn in the lower-level discussions held in Washington last week.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s office didn’t find out about the visit until it was set up and subsequently asked the Chinese delegation not to go, one of the people said. The Chinese were told this was because of domestic reasons, another person said.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He plans to visit Washington in the second week of October to meet Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for high-level negotiations, according to separate people familiar with that planning, and the two sides are aiming for a high-level meeting around Oct. 10.

The news about the cancellation came about an hour after President Donald Trump said he wasn’t interested in “a partial deal” with China based on Beijing increasing its purchases of U.S. agricultural products. China’s Vice Agricultural Minister Han Jun, a member of the trade delegation, said Saturday at an event in Washington that the farm tour had been discussed but not finalized, and the U.S. will extend an invitation for another time.

“Negotiations on the agriculture area went very well, and the two sides held thorough and candid communication,” Han said at the event, according to Chinese media. He also said China is willing to expand agriculture trade with U.S. and deepen cooperation “on the basis of equality and mutual respect”.

‘Goodwill’ Gesture

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said Thursday that the Chinese delegation’s farm tour represented a “goodwill” gesture by Beijing.

But on Friday, the Montana Farm Bureau Federation said it was told by the Chinese embassy that the delegation “had an adjustment of their agenda” and would return to China earlier than planned. The Nebraska Department of Agriculture, which also had planned to host the delegation, confirmed their visit was canceled, too.",MikeThePutz,1569235640,22,25,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d84tdj/chinese_trade_delegation_called_off_farm_visits/

Here's why I'm long on Altria,"Someone please tell me if my math is retarded. 

There are 48.5 million cigarette smokers in the US alone (according to a 5 second Google search). If every smoker buys 1 carton of cigs at an average cost of $70/carton that's $3.39B in Retail sales. Altria's average Gross Profit Margin let's conservatively say is 45%, (which in June 2019 it was actually 50%)...So it costs Altria $1.87B to supply 1 carton for every smoker in the US, but they bring home a gross profit of $1,527,750,000 every time....That's a lot of guap!

NIO Q2 Earning DD (9/24),"Well everyone this is my first DD post. I've invested in Nio since it IPO and you can imagine how rich I am now. I follow this company religiously. I'm a part of the exclusive Nio Shareholders association on Facebook, and get the inside details. 

**TLDR: Buy Puts**

Here are my reasons

1) Nio is reporting Q2 earnings just 6 days before their Q3 ends! Normally companies need to report earnings within 45 days of the quarter ending, Nio is long past 45 days. Delaying earnings is never a good sign of confidence. 

2) Excerpt from Q1 conference call, high cash burn, possibly higher then Q1. Wallstreet loves to crash a stock with cash burn.  

Question:  What is the outlook for the cash burn in future quarters? 

**Louis Hsieh** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*

Hey, Dan, it's Louis. We expect Q2 cash burn to be a little bit high, but then Q3 and Q4, once ES6 starts delivery, we expect the cash burn to come down relatively quickly.

3) Low delivers for the Q2 3,553, based off an average sale price of $57,357 per car I'm guessing $204 million in revenue with -7% gross margins. Leaving a 14 million loss on the books.

4) Nio didn't start layoff or cost cutting until Q3.

5) Analysis option chains, the market is expecting up to a $1 shit in price. $2.5 &gt; $3.5 range.

6) If your still reading this there has been a buy order sitting at $2.35 for over 100k shares, so don't buy puts below $2.5. This market maker will pump this stock up, and it will not break $2.35. 

7)  2/3rds of the Nio Shareholders association group think that this stock is going to moon, so inverse them.

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended the week on a mixed note. The People's Bank of China lowered its one-year prime rate to 4.20% from 4.25%, which was expected. The PBoC was also expected to cut the 5-yr prime rate, but it left that rate unchanged at 4.85%. South Korea's President, Moon Jae-in, has seen his approval rating fall to its lowest level since he began his term. Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, is visiting Washington today. India's Sensex outperformed after it was announced that tax rates for domestic companies and new domestic manufacturing companies will be reduced.

Major European indices are up modestly on what has been a relatively quiet day for news so far on both the corporate and economic fronts. Germany released a PPI report that was weaker than expected, validating the concerns about weak inflation that spurred the ECB recently to be more accommodative with its monetary policy. Separately, Brexit matters remain a focal point after EC President Juncker stirred things up yesterday in a *Sky News* interview, saying he thinks there can be a deal. He also added, however, that the EU is prepared for no deal, too. The pound popped on yesterday's news, but is backtracking a bit today with the *Irish Examiner* reporting Ireland's foreign minister has said there is a ""wide gap"" still between the EU position and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's position.

FORD IS GOING BANKRUPT IN 18 MONTHS (DD INSIDE),"HI I'M ACTUALLY AUTISTIC (MECHANICAL ENGINEER).  

&amp;#x200B;

***I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about*****, but Ford is definitely going fucking BANKRUPT in 18 months and the Mexico peso is going to zero.**  You should definitely long F puts for January 2022, and if you read below you'll be fucking RICH like me and we can share a hooker on our new LAMBOYACHT.  Yes--stay with me and we'll be so rich we'll have a lambo that floats like fucking shitty-shitty-bang-bang or whatever that gay ass movie was called.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last three nights the overnight repo rate has skyrocketed and the Fed has had to step in and inject some *$84 billion* into the markets where highly collaterlized debt hit FUCKING 9%.  That's PAWN SHOP RATES, bruhs.  The Fed says ""oh well its end of quarter tax payments!"".  Wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.  These assholes are lying to you.  This is the beginning of a **corporate debt crisis** of untold magnitude originally began with ZIRP and ""chasing yield"" that allowed highly capital intensive corporations like F to continuously roll over their ""high grade"" corporate debt for pennies on the dollar.  

&amp;#x200B;

The last three nights was just the beginning and it's going to get much worse.  ZIRP (that's zero interest rate policy for the morons that just started reading books) allowed corporations to issue massive amounts of corporate debt for pennies on the dollar as investors chased real yields.  These corporate debt coupons are paid monthly, quarterly or annually just like the mortgage and property tax you pay on the shitty fixer-upper you bought after binging on HGTV for a few days.  When they pay these coupons they need **COLD HARD CASH** just like you do, and if there's a cash crunch they can borrow it from overnight repo markets by putting up an asset (collateral) and retrieving cash (fucking cash) and then repay it overnight--hence ""REPO"" = ""REPOSSESSIVE"".  Are you still reading?  Keep fucking reading.

&amp;#x200B;

Well guess what?  Three days ago CORPORATIONS NEEDED CASH SO BAD THEY HAD TO PAY UPWARDS OF 9% BEFORE THE FED JUST PRINTED 86 BILLION OUT OF THIN AIR.  Yes... it was paid back the next day... but this is just the beginning.  

&amp;#x200B;

Wages are finally rising which aids in retail cash flow, but now **TARIFF MAN** has showed up on the scene to FIX THE WORLDS PROBLEMS and is increasing material price inputs.  Interest rates are rising that increase financing costs for corporates and labor prices are increasing AND NOW MATERIAL PRICES.  What's left?  What's fucking left?

&amp;#x200B;

**WELL ITS THE BROWN LIQUID THAT MAKES THE WORLD GO AROUND -- OIL.**

&amp;#x200B;

AND OIL IS GOING TO GOT THROUGH THE ROOF because Trump wants to start a war to prop up his abysmal approval ratings, give a hand job to the Saudi's AND blow Putin all at the same time (and who really doesn't enjoy a good bombing?)   

&amp;#x200B;

And what do people buy based on the price of oil?  TRUCKS.  And what the FUCK DOES FORD SELL?  Potatoes!  No, Eric, the answer is fucking **TRUCKS**. (FORD = TRUCKS IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING)

&amp;#x200B;

Rising wages.  Corporate debt crisis.  Rising material costs.  Oil shock.  What the fuck does this have to do with the peso?

&amp;#x200B;

In order to keep paying the corporate debt coupons, they will need to improve cash flow by having a firesale on assets and converting them to USD to pay their bond holders (PAID IN CASH--USD--NOT PESOS).  They will liquidate foreign assets to collect cash (SELLING IN PESO AND BUYING USD) which will have the effect of TANKING THE PESO.

&amp;#x200B;

**LONG FORD PUTS JANUARY 2022.**

Morning Briefing (9/19/2019),"# Futures lower as investors weigh FOMC policy decision

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade six points, or 0.2%, below fair value as the market appears in a state of flux after the Fed's policy decision yesterday. 

The market got what it wanted (a 25-bps cut), but there is a sense of uncertainty regarding the future of monetary policy, at least according to Fed Chair Powell's tone and the discrete views within the voting committee. Earlier today, the Bank of England and Bank of Japan both left their key interest rates unchanged at 0.75% and -0.10%, respectively. 

The Fed, and investors, will receive a key economic report today in Existing Homes Sales for August (Briefing.com consensus 5.36 million) at 10:00 a.m. ET. 

Also on the calendar, the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 213,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Current Account Balance for the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus -$135.0 billion), and the Philadelphia Fed Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 8.0) will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET. 

**Microsoft** (**MSFT** 139.88, +1.36, +1.0%) has been a nice measure of support for the market. Shares are up 1.0% in pre-market action after the company announced a $40 billion buyback program and increased its quarterly dividend to $0.51/share from $0.46/share.

U.S. Treasury yields are slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.74%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 98.27. WTI crude is up 2.0%, or $1.15, to $59.26/bbl after *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Saudi Arabia is asking foreign producers for crude and oil products to address its supply disruption. 

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **U.S. Steel** (X 11.12, -1.30): -10.4% after guiding Q3 EPS below consensus. The stock was downgraded at Macquarie with a price target of $9.

**Asia**: Nikkei +0.4%, Hang Seng -1.1%, Shanghai +0.5%

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday on a mixed note. The Bank of Japan made no changes to its policy stance, keeping interest on excess reserves at -0.10%. The central bank hinted at potential action at its October meeting, which will take place almost a month after the sales tax increases to 10.0% from 8.0%. Economic data from Australia showed a larger than expected increase in employment, but that overshadowed a decrease in full-time employment. The disappointing report has prompted calls for a rate cut at RBA's October meeting.

   * Japan's July All Industries Activity Index +0.25 m/m (expected 0.4%; last -0.7%)

Major European indices trade in the green. Prompted by strong activity in Norway's energy sector, Norges Bank has gone against the global easing trend, raising its deposit rate by 25 bps to 1.50%. The Swiss National Bank, meanwhile, left its SARON at -0.75%, reiterating the longstanding view that the franc remains overvalued. The Bank of England also opined today but left its key rate and asset purchase program unchanged at their respective 0.75% and GBP435 bln. The BoE's policy statement noted that the bank rate would have to increase ""to a limited and gradual extent"" in the event of a smooth Brexit and an uptick in global growth.

Daily DD- Buy SPY calls,"So clearly the market didn't crash the last two days, but that has not limited my faith in long term puts. Expect Trump's impact to be miniscule the next two days and SPY to keep climbing because he usually saves his bullshit tweets for over the weekend so you can't unload your positions. 

Since we closed green today with all the bullshit going on, go ahead and mark us down for a new ATH tomorrow and potentially 303 by Friday close. Trump will probably get bored over the weekend, and tweet threatening shit to Persia on Saturday and enact more tariffs on Sunday. 

That being said, I'm thinking we go calls the rest of the week and then unload right before close. Buy puts when they're cheap as fuck Friday, hold them over the weekend and let trump do what trump does best, and then make a fucking killing on Monday. 

This might be the most foolproof DD I've ever had. I know there's not a lot to show for it, but I've had Trump's tweet notifications on for 4 years now. I know his tweet patterns. We're very close to another tweet storm.  

Tldr: buy SPY calls till Friday at noon, then switch it up on em and buy SPY puts to hold over the weekend because it's about time for a Trump storm. It's fucking foolproof.",GramsOfLoud,1568846098,31,45,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d64rv1/daily_dd_buy_spy_calls/

SPY calls and inverting myself,"Literally all of my gut instincts are telling me that Jpow 💥 is going to either keep rates the same or merely cut 25bps and then say this is the end of the mid cycle adjustment. Every ounce of logic I can muster (which admittedly isn’t a lot) is screaming puts. Oil just spiked, we are at a double top in the market, economic data has been better lately (less need for a cut), equity inflows are up, and Trump tweeted that he made a mistake picking jpow 💥 for Fed chair a few days ago, leading me to believe he was alerted early on a cut wasn’t coming. Plus, everyone on WSB is posting that a giant dip is coming because a cut will either not arrive, or will be perceived as “not enough”...

So today I bought a shit ton of SPY calls for October with a $310 exp. 

I guess we’ll see at 2:01 tomorrow 🤷‍♂️",MikeThePutz,1568770629,101,76,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d5qot1/spy_calls_and_inverting_myself/
VNQ,"So I posted this in the daily discussion but thought it needed some more widespread acknowledgement. 

Today VNQ, Vanguards REIT ETF, had an option trading volume 53x it’s average. What were these options you ask?

They were over 180,000 puts and 0 calls. After some advanced calculations I found that this is over 30,000,000 dollars worth of puts. 

What are these puts? How can I copy some wealthy individuals with such confidence? I have the answer. 

Of these 180,000 puts, all were for March 2020. 120,000 were for $82 strike price and 60,000 were for $88. The stock is currently trading around $94. 

Purchasing puts on such a highly reputable firms ETF definitely comes with some implications. Some may even say a it implies the next housing bubble. Do I think the housing market will crash? No. Do I think that someone smarter than me thinks the housing market will tumble? Absolutely.

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value as the Fed kicks off its two-day policy meeting today. Oil prices, meanwhile, have come down slightly from yesterday's 15% spike, leaving WTI crude down just 1.7% (-$1.09) to $61.81/bbl. 

The Fed is still expected to cut the fed funds rate by 25 basis points tomorrow, although the view that the Fed will leave rates unchanged has increased to 34.2% from 7.7% last week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. An improved view on trade and growth has contributed to reduced expectations for a rate cut. 

In corporate news, glassmaker **Corning Inc.** (**GLW** 27.45, -2.60, -8.7%) cut its third quarter outlook for display and optical sales due to weaker demand. 3G Capital, meanwhile, has used this month's rally to sell 25 million shares, or 9.3% of its stake, of the struggling **Kraft Heinz** (**KHC** 28.82, -0.80, -2.7%).

On the data front, investors will receive Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.5%) for August at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by the NAHB Housing Market Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 66) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for July at 4:00 p.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.57.

Short Sterling,"Supreme Court is currently ruling whether the suspension of Parliament in the UK by BoJo was legal. One court has said not, another said it's a matter of politics not law, so sod off. Supreme Court has the decider. Can't see any other way than ruling in favour of BoJo, which means less time for Parliament to sit and less time to find a deal. hence, more chance no deal, and Sterling tanks. If it is found unlawful, then he has mislead the Queen, no confidence votes, public execution, head on spike at Tower of London etc etc, but more faff with election and therefore less time to find a deal, and Sterling might take a hit as well.

The case for short term $EA calls .. it's FIFA BABY! (details inside),"Alright fellow degenerates, $EA releases FIFA 2020 on Sept. 27 in North America and Sept. 29 worldwide. This is why short-term calls on the hype is a must:

&amp;#x200B;

* The best-selling PlayStation 4 video game title in 2016 was FIFA 17, which sold 10.03 million units. (source: VGChartz, 2017)
* EA’s *FIFA* is built on an arsenal of real-world data. Professional soccer consists of 800 teams (comprised of 18,000 players) across a variety of countries, and each is represented in-game (source: Western Digital blog) [https://datamakespossible.westerndigital.com/meet-data-master-ea-sports-fifa/](https://datamakespossible.westerndigital.com/meet-data-master-ea-sports-fifa/)
* FIFA 19's ""Ultimate Team"" made up 28% of EA's revenue last year ... just one portion of the FIFA video game series (source:"" PCGamesN) [https://www.pcgamesn.com/fifa-ultimate-team-revenue](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fifa-ultimate-team-revenue)
* 95% of the planet's purchasing power is outside the U.S. and soccer, for some strange reason, is popular in countries not named ""U S of A"".  


Below, you will see the stock chart from last year for the week leading up to the FIFA 2019 release. While the chart doesn't show it, 52 weeks ago, the stock had gone down 1%, then climbed a little more than 5% going into the release, for a total of a 6% climb. Now, previous behavior is not indicative of future behavior, and we have FOMC coming up which will affect the markets as a whole. 

**My suggested play:**

Take a small position tomorrow (Tuesday, Sept. 17). After FOMC, consider DCA'ing into your position and ride your calls into TendieTown^(TM). Offload those motherfuckers on Monday, Sept. 26. Ride the hype, and sell DAT NEWS!

ACAD update on where I think it goes from here,"If you want to see my original FULL thesis on ACAD (what they do, market size, target price, etc) it is in my post history from a few months ago and the link is below. I think this will eventually go the way of ARRY- they announce their main, long awaited, biggest, trial stops early due to efficacy, they release data at a conference a few weeks later, and then get bought out a few weeks after that. No way a drug company like ACAD with a single drug and multiple uses stays independent. It makes too much sense for a large drug company with no organic growth and a large sales force to buy them and to fire all the sales force and layer in the drug with their existing sales people... just a matter of when. I have Jan 2020 $45 calls so I hope the full data gets released earlier rather than later... but make no mistake, the trial was stopped early due to exceptional p-value.

[LONG] Revolve ($RVLV) heading into October trade talks and 11/5 Q3 earnings,"**SITUATION OVERVIEW**

Revolve Group IPO’d 11.8M shares on June 6, 2019 at $18/share (implied market cap $1.23B). Shares rose 180% to $50 in the ensuing two weeks, a move driven by a Citron report with a $50 price target and high investor appetite for IPOs that summer. Shares then plummeted after hitting an ATH on June 19. Even a decent Q2 report on August 8 (beat on “consensus” Revenue, small miss on EPS) failed to reverse sentiment; instead, shares fell another 15% after earnings. Recently, RVLV seems to have found support around \~$21/share. Trade war concerns have likely overshadowed strong fundamentals, and shares should see some upward momentum heading into the October U.S.-China negotiations.      

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW** 

Revolve is a leading online fashion retailer for Generation Z and Millennial women (ages 18-44). In the 12 months ended 3/31/2019, Revolve’s websites generated 9.8 million unique visitors per month, 56% of which came from free and low-cost sources. In fact, Revolve’s customer acquisition costs are some of the lowest in the industry. Revolve spends \~$38 to acquire a new customer. E-retail competitors like Farfetch spend \~$100—and that number is rising. While Revolve’s CACs have increased modestly over the last few years (CAC was $30 in 2014), contribution margins and customer lifetime value are also rising. 

Revolve drives this outperformance through innovative marketing efforts that target social media influencers. In 2009, Revolve began shipping free samples of its products to influencers. Today, Revolve continues to cater engaging content through a network of over 3,500 influencers. These influencers wear free Revolve merchandise, vacation on Revolve’s dime, and attend Revolve-exclusive parties—all while documenting the experience on Instagram.

In 2018 alone, 75% of marketing spend ($55M) went to performance marketing efforts like the Revolve Festival at Coachella. Revolve has taken a leaf from the Kering and LVMH playbook by curating a lifestyle around its brands. But instead of peddling $1,000 pumps and $10,000 handbags, Revolve strikes a premium price point ($275 average order size as of Q2 2019). I have not come across any lifestyle brands that have executed this specific strategy as well as Revolve has. 

Revolve currently segments its revenues and gross profit between two sites: REVOLVE ($258 average order size in FY18) and FORWARD ($653 average order size in FY18). Both websites offer a product mix of apparel, footwear, and accessories. The REVOLVE site sells merchandise from “emerging” third party brands (42% of net sales), Revolve-owned brands (31%), and established third party brands (26%)—850 brands in total. Here, Revolve has seen immense success developing and selling its own 21 brands. Owned brands represent 8 of the top 10 brands on REVOLVE. 4 of the top 5 search terms that led to a purchase at REVOLVE came from owned brands. 

The FORWARD site sells luxury fashion from brands like Gucci, Fendi, and Balenciaga—250 brands in total. FORWARD comprised 12% of sales in the LTM, and REVOLVE the remaining 88%. Revolve has also dipped its toes in beauty, menswear, and lower-price apparel. In Q2 2019, Revolve launched the website superdown, which strikes the $40-$60 price range for most SKUs and targets Gen Z women. 

**MANAGEMENT** 

Co-Founders and -CEOs Michael Mente and Michael Karanikolas demonstrate management expertise, having grown Revolve to a $1B valuation with only $15M in outside capital from TSG Consumer Partners since 2003. Together, they own 68% of 57M Class B shares post-IPO (a combined \~$900M as of September 2019).      

**THESIS**

**Revolve has a path to 100% upside by 2021 with relatively low execution risk**​. The Company is poised to capture significant market share from legacy retailers by capitalizing on a changing retail shopping experience. In doing so, Revolve is also building brand equity in a portfolio of premium-fashion brands; customers view these not as private labels, but as highly desirable and independent peers to other established third-party brands on the REVOLVE website. And as Revolve realizes a more favorable owned mix, it will enjoy stickier revenue, higher margins, and more efficient use of working capital. Numerous additional growth engines can and will propel the Company beyond its current demographics and segments. These include: beauty, mens’, accessories and footwear, and international, among others. 

Trading at 2.6x 2019E Revenue and 29x 2019E Adj. EBITDA, Revolve looks appropriately valued relative to peers. However, I have high confidence in management’s ability to satisfy annual targets given a long track record of successful execution and the fundamental merits of the business model. Very few retailers boast a 6.2x 4-year LTV/CAC and 89% net sales retention. 

An investment in Revolve is an investment in:  
 ❏ technology-first operators with considerable skin in the game  
 ❏ a data-driven sourcing and fulfillment back-end  
 ❏ an integrated stack of e-commerce websites  
 ❏ a social media presence that reaches tens of millions of eyeballs ❏ a growing suite of owned and diversified brands  
 ❏ the future of fashion retail      

**TARGET MARKET AND INDUSTRY TRENDS** 

There are 57 million Americans in Revolve’s target market of 18- to 44-year-old women. While only a small proportion of them has (1) the discretionary income and (2) the fashion sense to shop at Revolve, the market is far from saturated. Management estimates that their target demographic is less than &lt;3% penetrated worldwide. Revolve retained 1.2M active customers in 2018; this implies a global market of 40M active customers. 

More than ever before, consumers—especially women—are buying clothes online. The U.S. online apparel, footwear, accessories, and beauty market was $117B in 2018; it is expected to grow at a 13.2% CAGR to $170B in 2021. Social media use is amplifying this trend. Customers are increasingly discovering and transacting via websites like Instagram, which lead in brand engagement. In March 2019, Revolve announced a partnership with Instagram as one of the first retailers to offer in-app checkout. 

Of course, legacy department stores compete in e-commerce as well. But they offer a value proposition materially different to Revolve’s. The big boxes (e.g. Nordstrom, Amazon) target too broad of a demographic, offer ubiquitous brands, and react slowly to fashion trends. Revolve, in contrast, has carved out a niche that caters to fashion-forward Millennial and Gen Z women specifically. Furthermore, Revolve has developed a reputation for seamless customer experience: free 2-3 day shipping, free returns, 24/7 customer service, order tracking, 90-day warranties, etc. 

**OUTSTANDING E-RETAIL PERFORMANCE** 

Revolve boasts some of the most impressive e-commerce performance and metrics in the industry. Management has made LTV/CAC data available on every annual cohort of customers since 2014. The 2014 cohort in particular exhibits a 3-year LTV/CAC of 5x and a 4-year LTV/CAC of more than 6x. Expectedly, this ratio has deteriorated slightly—today’s customers are more expensive to acquire. The effect is offset slightly by improving contribution margins and growing LTV. 

Revolve also tracks customer retention by cohort. On average over the ‘14, ‘15, ‘16, and ‘17 cohorts, Revolve retained 62% of the cohorts’ net sales from the year in which it acquired a customer (Year 0) to the next year (Year 1), and 102% of the cohort’s net sales from Year 1 to Year 2. Surprisingly, retention has been improving with successive cohorts. In 2014, Revolve retained 84% of the prior year’s net sales. In 2018, Revolve retained 89% of the prior year’s net sales. 

These metrics speak to growing customer loyalty, satisfaction, and stickiness at Revolve. 

**GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY DRIVERS** 

❏  **Sophisticated inventory management and small-batch offerings**   
 By some counts, Revolve is a technology company that also happens to sell clothing. Their back-end leverages millions of historical and real-time data points about customer preferences to capitalize on fashion trends and source inventory accordingly. By ordering in limited quantities, Revolve has also succeeded in generating a sense of urgency around its products. 79% of net sales in FY18 were made at full price, suggesting that this strategy is working. Return rates are slightly under 50%—in line with industry standards. 

❏  **Growth in owned brand penetration**   
 Revolve has created 21 brands (with more on the way). These owned brands generate greater productivity per style2, larger average order sizes, and higher gross margins. REVOLVE’s brand mix also represents a moat against competition. “Emerging” (see: less widely known) third party and owned brands collectively drive 70% of sales at REVOLVE. Therefore, there is less overlap between REVOLVE’s product offering and those of other e-retailers. 

❏  **International sales growth**   
 Non-Americans comprise 45% of the social media following across Revolve’s Instagram accounts, but drive only 18% of sales. A more seamless international ordering experience could bridge this gap. Management ranks its international customer experience, in order of best to worst: UK, Western Europe, Australia, Canada, Asia. It recently completed “localization” efforts in the UK to improve fulfillment. More Western European countries are on the way. 

❏  **Enhanced product mix and target demographics**  
 Men’s fashion has historically not sold as well through Instagram, but that too is beginning to   
 change. Net-A-Porter has seen massive success with its men’s offering, Mr. Porter ($2.5B FY17 Revenue, 1.1M Instagram followers for @mrporterlive). REVOLVE MAN exists, but needs a dedicated website, in my opinion. Beauty is another area that Revolve has begun to develop, but that involvement is still in its infancy. 

Management stated on the Q2 2019 call that men’s and beauty will take the backburner; legacy REVOLVE, FORWARD, and superdown will take priority in the near-future. As an investor, I would rather buy into a management team that does a few things well rather than many things poorly. 

❏  **Recurrence of growth at FORWARD**   
 Revenue growth at FORWARD turned negative in FY18 (-5.5% YoY) and Q1 2019 (-9.8% YoY). Management attributes the decline to its decision to reset inventory levels and refresh the product mix. Resultantly, average order size and active users have fallen over the last several quarters. In Q2 2019, growth turned positive once again (+14.6% YoY). Q2 2018 may have simply been an easy quarter to lap, but I buy management’s explanation. 

❏  **Lower entry point merchandise via superdown**   
 33% of Revolve’s social following belongs to Generation Z. These younger customers have lower discretionary income than Millenials. superdown—Revolve’s answer to lower-price retailers like Urban Outfitters and ASOS—could draw hundreds of thousands of new customers into the Revolve ecosystem. Some cannibalization is to be expected, but Gen Z and Millennial tastes differ enough to segment products between two websites and price points. My own experiences confirm that Gen Z is a substantial growth opportunity: Several of my female friends are aware of Revolve and would like to shop there, but find it too expensive for their budgets. 

**TRADE WAR**  
Recent price action likely reflects Revolve’s trade war exposure. I believe management has greater flexibility around trade issues than the market is giving credit for. First, Revolve does not disclose the geographic breakdown of inventory, but leaves some clues in the S-1: 

❏  “We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. ​**We use multiple third-party suppliers and manufacturers based primarily in China** and, ​**to a lesser extent, the United States and India** to source and manufacture all of our products under our owned brands. We engage our third- party suppliers and manufacturers on a ​**purchase order basis and are not party to long-term contracts**​ with any of them” (24). 

❏  “The U.S. government has recently imposed increased tariffs on certain imports from China. While **the current tariffs only affect a small portion of the products that we currently import from China, specifically handbags and makeup, the current U.S. administration has increased the tariff rate from 10% to 25% and indicated that the higher tariffs may be imposed on additional imports from China, including finished goods apparel and shoes**​, which, if imposed, would include a predominant portion of the products that we import from China” (40). 

The majority of Revolve’s inventory—particularly for owned brands—is sourced from China, though most of its imports are not (yet) subject to tariffs. On the Q2 call, management cited the following mitigants: 

1) REVOLVE and FORWARD customers are less elastic to price than those of discount retailers. They argue that customers are more interested in what’s “new and exciting” than finding the best price for a particular SKU/style 

2)  Management has strong relationships with vendors in China; in a world with prolonged tariffs, Revolve could offset some costs to Vendors (it has leverage in threatening to switch to apparel   
 markets like Thailand or Vietnam, for instance) 

3)  Revolve has plans to diversify inventory sources over the next 12-18 months. As such, the trade   
 war represents only a short-to-medium-term headwind 

The latter two points are admittedly more compelling than the first. As an investor in Revolve, I am also pleased to learn that Revolve sources inventory via purchase order rather than contract; switching costs should theoretically be lower during a supply chain relocation. I do not have sufficient information to assess the impact of a protracted trade war, but Revolve has some levers it can pull. 

**VALUATION** 

Relative to other e-commerce peers, Revolve looks fairly valued in the context of its 2019E revenue growth and profitability. I used sell-side consensus numbers from CapitalIQ.

I value Revolve on multiples of both 2021E Revenue and 2021E Adj. EBITDA. My estimates do not differ materially from sell-side, though I assume no growth in the FORWARD segment and instead take a more bullish view on top-line growth at REVOLVE. I am forecasting $893M in 2021E Revenue and $110M in 2021E Adj. EBITDA.

I present a wide range of enterprise value multiples to reflect uncertainty over long-term growth prospects and account for a potentially weaker retail market in 2021. The valuation would have to fall to below 1.7x 2021E Revenue or 14x 2021E Adj. EBITDA for investors to incur a loss on the position—both of which are relatively unlikely given the strengths of the business discussed hitherto. Even at a relatively conservative 20x 2021E Adj. EBITDA, RVLV would trade at a 43% premium to current prices. On consistent earnings momentum, the name could very well double in the next 2-3 years.   

**Q2 2019 RESULTS** 

Quarter 2, 2019 (ended June 30) was Revolve’s first quarter as a publicly-traded company. Q2 has historically been Revolve’s best quarter due to higher volumes in anticipation of the summer months. 

The Company missed slightly on Non-GAAP EPS and beat slightly on revenue. Forecasting is difficult for even the most experienced management teams, and Revolve should get better at it with time. 

Management confirmed the completion of a new warehouse facility that will provide capacity beyond 2021. Lower FCF of \~$2M during the quarter was the result of higher capex for this fulfillment facility. Management also instituted revenue guidance of $598M-$608M and Adj. EBITDA guidance of $51M-$56M for FY19. 

Heading into Q3 2019, RVLV should benefit from the recent launch of superdown.

Morning Briefing (9/16/2019),"# Futures retreat after drone attack on Saudi oil facilities

U.S. futures are down modestly following a drone attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities that has sent oil prices ($60.04/bbl, +5.20, +9.5%) soaring and has escalated tensions in the Middle East. The S&amp;P 500 futures trade 13 points, or 0.4%, below fair value after three straight weeks of gains. 

Saudi Aramco suspended 5.7 million barrels per day of oil output but said it intends on restoring 33% of lost output on Monday. *Reuters* reported that it could take months for Saudi Aramco to resume normal production. WTI crude surged more than 15% at the Sunday open, but gains have been pared after President Trump authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

President Trump also said the U.S. is ""locked and loaded depending on the verification"" of the culprit, raising concerns about a military conflict. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Iran was behind the attack.

Oil-sensitive energy stocks are likely to extend their gains from last week, while airline stocks may see relative weakness. **Exxon Mobil** (**XOM** 74.90, +2.26, +3.1%) and **Chevron** (**CVX** 125.25, +3.75, +3.2%) are both up over 3% in pre-market action. **American Airlines** (**AAL** 28.80, -1.15, -3.8%) is down nearly 4%.

Elsewhere, U.S. Treasuries are up noticeably after a big sell-off last week. The 2-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.75%, and the 10-yr yield is down seven basis points to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.40.

**Asia &amp; Europe detail:**

*Asia: Nikkei closed, Hang Seng -0.8%, Shanghai unch*

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region began the week on a mixed note while Japan's Nikkei was closed for a holiday. Commodities were in focus after a Saturday attack on two refineries in Saudi Arabia. Early reports suggested that the attack impacted roughly 5% of total global oil output while a more recent report indicated that Saudi Arabia expects that roughly a third of the lost production will be restored before Tuesday. Crude oil surged more than 15.0% at the Sunday open, and is currently up 8.3% at $59.41/bbl. China's reserve requirement ratio cut went into effect while the latest set of economic data from China disappointed. *Reuters* reported that China was behind a cyber attack on Australia's parliament and main political parties prior to an election in May, but Australia's government did not make a public accusation due to a fear that the country's trade relationship with China would be impacted. Protests in Hong Kong continued over the weekend.

* In economic data:
   * China's August Fixed Asset Investment +5.5% yr/yr (expected 5.6%; last 5.7%), August Industrial Production +4.4% yr/yr (expected 5.2%; last 4.8%), August Retail Sales +7.5% yr/yr (expected 7.9%; last 7.6%), and August Unemployment Rate 5.2% (last 5.3%)
   * South Korea's August trade surplus $1.65 bln (expected $1.72 bln). August Imports -4.2% yr/yr (last -4.2%) and August Exports -13.8% yr/yr (last -13.6%)
   * India's August WPI Inflation +1.08% yr/yr (expected 1.04%; last 1.08%)

Major European indices trade in negative territory. British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is in Luxembourg, where he will meet with European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, to lobby for changes to the Brexit deal. Prime Minister Johnson said recently that he has seen ""real signs of movement"" from the EU towards scrapping the Irish backstop, but the EU officials have pushed back against this suggestion. The World Trade Organization granted the U.S. the right to impose tariffs over subsidies that were granted to Airbus.

The Saudis are playing 5D chess. DJT was playing checkers.,"So here is my theory okay. The Saudis bombed their own oil fields to spike the price of oil for the upcoming Aramco IPO. Higher oil price equals higher IPO price. But they just cant bomb the shit out of the oil fields, they need someone to blame it on or else it looks suspicious. So they get these half rate ISIS Yemeni bastards to claim responsibility for the ""attack"" maybe they pay them or pull some favors. I dont know but they agree to take the blame.  

Where they went wrong in their scheme however, is they keyed in Donald on their plan. And Donald being the forward thinker that he is, thought to himself, ""hey these saudis are gonna need someone to take the blame."" So Donald blames the attack on Iran. Because Iran is an easy target, But Don didn't know the Saudis already got the Yemeni to take the blame. 

Now Don being the business mogul that he is, saw an opportunity. He was gonna sell the big reserve of oil the US has been keeping to make a profit. Maybe its gonna fund the wall or some shit I dont know. Anyway Don doesnt know anything about economics or that his profit opportunity completely undermines the Saudis plan to raise prices.

You see the saudis are trying to limit supply. And Big Don is now taking a big black oily dump flooding the market with oil.

"Recession hitting India hard, gonna get a lot worse","So, I just spoke to my Dad in India, he owns, runs a small scale factory there. 
He told me a few weeks back that Indian news outlets were sending out warnings about a recession.
Today he told me that the government has accepted that recession has come and have announced that they are looking into measures to control it. Companies have reported a drop in their revenues, sales of vehicles and biscuits(cookies) have dropped and Indian kids love biscuits.
To add fire to the rocket fuel, the state I used to live in(Andhra Pradesh),  has recently elected a new party. This chief minister (person who runs the state) is young, inexperienced, populist and aggressive. He suddenly announced after getting elected that all state government contracts will be nullified and put into review for corruption effective immediately, this process has obviously majorly fucked up the supply chain especially as a new capital city was being built from scratch for this state. This review process is very slow and will take years. 
This has fucked things up majorly. Low skilled labor workers have dropped their request for wages by 30%-40%, India already has very low pay rates for labor, these people will only barely get by as they can't find work and even if they do will be paid super low wages.
Most of India's population is either middle class or poor, so the spending acroos the country will drop big time.
This will be much worse for India than 2008, it didn't get hit as bad during the mortgage crisis because although the real estate market took a hit there too, most people in India have like 50% or more of their savings in black money (income,assets not reported to the govt). This softened the blow quite a lot during 2008 and India recovered quickly, but that won't be of much use this time.

TLDR Recession hitting India, could easily be worse than 2008, especially to the businesses in the state of Andhra Pradesh

WeWork Will Have The Most Successful IPO Ever (DD Inside),"History repeats itself, so hear me out.  


* WeWork is a terrible company that has a CEO who doesn't play by the rules and sees himself as a lone genius.
* The artist Damien Hirst is a terrible artist who doesn't play by the rules and sees himself as a lone genius.  

* In 2019 WeWork pulled a bunch of shady maneuvers like the CEO selling his own trademarks to the company to pull cash out.
* In 2008 Damien Hirst created ""For the Love of God"" a ""sculpture"" that was a skull covered in diamond and sold it for over £50 million, the most expensive sale of art by a living artist... to himself and his broker.  

* In 2019 WeWork wants to launch an IPO even though they produce nothing of value.
* In 2008 Damien Hirst launched his own art auction by going under the gallery that represents him to sell directly at a Sotheby's auction, even though his art is made by assistants and he does nothing of value.

His gallery could have boycotted the auction and let it tank, but that would have crashed the value of all his art, which they owned hundreds of pieces of. The auction happened on September 15th and was expected to bring in at least $120 million over an evening and day sale, it grossed $200.75 million. Less than two weeks later the stock market crashed, starting the 2008 Recession.

If the market doesn't buy WeWork it's essentially saying ""we don't believe in tech companies who don't produce a profit"", which undermines 90% of tech companies the market has gone wild for. **The market will prop-up the price with a frenzy, and then crash shortly afterwards.**

China trade DD follow up.,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is a follow up to the DD I wrote several weeks ago, where I advocated a sharp escalation in the trade war in the first few months of 2020. Here is the link ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cuv4wh/my\_china\_theory\_dd\_the\_trade\_war\_is\_going\_to\_hit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cuv4wh/my_china_theory_dd_the_trade_war_is_going_to_hit/)). TL/DR at bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Context:

PLEASE READ my original post before this (ignore stock play recommendations at the end of my prior post, they are honestly retarded and I changed my mind on it and will detail my current position at the end). Did you read it? No? Go read it. This entire post is couched in my diagnosis of the situation as detailed in the prior post. Therefore, reading this alone won’t provide a sufficient argument, so go read it. Below I have written down a step by step explanation of what is going on contextually, as I see it. The TL/DR is at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

(1) Both sides have a lot to lose IF THEY ARE BLAMED for a failed interim deal and the resulting escalation. This is a huge issue and it characterizes all of the news you have been reading this past week. If the trade war escalates it will cause a global recession and it will have huge consequences for whichever side receives most of the ‘blame’ for the resulting escalation. Whoever is blamed for this will face serious consequences: go read my prior post for how a Chinese recession would affect Xi and his cabal. For the U.S., a failed negotiation that is blamed on Trump would lead to him being canned and then prosecuted without his executive legal protections.

 

(2) However, Trump DOES have the upper hand and everyone knows it. China has a weaker hand and they know it. How do both parties handle this situation? How do you try and strong arm someone WHILE preventing them from claiming you’re an irrational asshole if a deal doesn’t occur and shit gets real hot? This is how: you shape international opinion before the meeting. You use REALLY flowery language. Both sides postpone tariffs or peel them back. Both sides say “I’m open to an interim deal!”. Both sides praise the others’ leadership, congratulate them on a national holiday, and make the world think that you are ALSO interested in a de-escalation. Both sides tell the world that they are the responsible party and want a de-escalation. Everything that is going on right now is shaping their respective domestic audiences to blame the other side should negotiations fail and escalation occur. More importantly, by claiming to be the most reasonable party, you greatly reinforce your strength in talks, as the fallout from walking is less for you than it is for the other party. To restate this in simple terms, if China is successful in convincing it’s people and Americans that they want de-escalation, but offer little, Trump throws a fit and escalates, they will still ‘win’: Trump will take the blame in both China and the U.S. for the resulting economic fallout.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) Per my prior post, China wants Trump out of office. They will be reluctant to give him what he wants here, which is a “meal ticket to reelection”. That is what Trump is going to ask for. Everyone knows he has the stronger hand, so he is going to ask China for a “GREAT” deal. He has literally never settled for a shitty deal when he was in a strong bargaining position. Big agricultural purchases. Eliminated tariffs on American exports. Good-sounding intellectual property protection (although he may not push on this, and will seek big purchases instead, knowing if he is reelected he can push on IP in 2021). He wants a deal so good, he can parade around swing states and claim he took it to the Chinese to the cleaners. The stock market will moon, swing states will get Chinese tendies rained on them, and Trump will get reelected. The quid pro quo is that he won’t escalate with his stronger-hand while asking the Chinese to help him get reelected. 

&amp;#x200B;

(4) However, China is unlikely to go along with this. They want him out. They know if he is reelected he’ll reneg and come back asking for a better deal. They don’t trust him at all and see him as unpredictable. See everything in my prior post—I have a much longer rationale for why Beijing wants Trump out of office. This trade war is a referendum on the U.S.-China relationship and its outcome will affect the next 10 years of U.S.-Sino relations. SO, if Xi won’t sign Trump’s ‘get me reelected’ deal, what is the Chinese play right now? Stalling. Xi needs to stall for time until Trump gets distracted by campaigning late next Spring. How best to do this? Participate in trade talks. Espouse flowery language, send delegations, engage in dialogue, reduce some tariffs on American imports (to China), paint yourself as the reasonable party (“we do not want to escalate”). Don’t cave to Trump, but draw the talks out into December, add a holiday hiatus, and then into January. If the Chinese can draw this out without escalation (which would hurt them more than Trump) into early Spring, 2020 campaign season will arrive and they know Trump will be too distracted to focus on them.

&amp;#x200B;

(5) So, Trump won’t get a ‘great interim deal’ and the Chinese will stall for time and deflect blame. So what should Trump do? I believe his most politically-successful path is to continue forward and escalate. There are several rationales for this. (5.1) A trade war that is ‘stalled’ and ‘going nowhere’ but still harming American consumers will hurt Trump. Imagine if he just ‘tables’ the trade war, people are going to think it was all for nothing. The optics would be horrible. It would be a great democrat attack line of his “insane and unpredictable wielding of executive power”. If the trade war isn’t producing tendies he needs it to be in-progress and evolving. (5.2) He can’t give in at this point. First, China won’t give a good enough deal to make it look like anything but capitulation. Giving in for a shitty deal right now makes him look like a pussy and people will ridicule him for throwing markets and alienating the world just to return to the status quo. Moreover, Trump has literally never capitulated when in a position of strength in a negotiation. We laugh about ‘art of the deal’ but the guy is consistent on some things. (5.3) Outside of farming communities (whose states he will still carry against any of the top polling democrats), the trade war has pretty broad bipartisan support. It is FAR less of a political dividing line than people thought it would be. People from Cali to NYC to know that China is ‘wrong’ on the issues and that we’ve been stolen from for too long. Even Soros supports the trade war. Think on that. Trump, therefore, has political armor if the Chinese don’t give him what he wants in November and he escalates. It would be hard for a democrat to argue against Trump on the issue, as it would be seen as coming off weak on China—especially with the topics broad support. (5.4) Trump thrives on nationalism and conflict. The trade war provides him with an enemy he can blame, a boogeyman that he can attack with decent bipartisan support. He can drape himself in the flag—a flag with decent bipartisan support—and push a narrative of defending the U.S. from Chinese predation. 

&amp;#x200B;

(6) For these above reasons, Trump is (1) unlikely to get a reelection meal ticket and (2) likely to escalate. Over the next two weeks you’ll see a lot of conciliatory and flowery language. People will be ‘reasonable’. This is all a show. It is theatre to convince the world that each side is ‘right’. Even during the trade talks you’ll hear people continue to shape that narrative until…drum roll please…The Chinese are unreasonable! Who would have known! It will be such a shock, “they came here with false promises of looking to end the trade war but they offer nothing!”. Trump will increase sanctions and go for the jugular. Xi can play the ‘I don’t want to escalate’ card for so-long without a loss of face domestically. 

&amp;#x200B;

(7) The Chinese will retaliate between early November and early December, with SPY hitting its floor between January and April 2020. China will want to take advantage of the political impact of a huge stock market hit before the holiday break. I think there is a decent chance they will play the single-use rare earth card (they halt rare earth exports to American companies…but this only works once, as it leads to the development of related mines in Australia, southeast asia, and north Cali to take up the slack) sometime between December and January. That would have a huge impact for the year leading up to Trump’s election, and the optics of it are “good” for them in the sense that they are ‘just’ refusing to export to us, rather than them tariffing American imports. Even if some U.S. companies can indirectly get rare-earth, it will have a huge impact regardless and may be enough to tip consumer confidence into making the recession a reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

(8) I think it is tempting to think “trump can’t win in recession” à he will sign a deal. I think this ignores the alternative scenarios that I lay out above. I believe the political (U.S.) backdrop of the trade war, China’s desire to boot Trump out of office, our stronger-position relative to China, and Trump’s own persona, beliefs, trade-team, etc, all contribute towards this October deal possibility being unlikely. I think Trump may be able to win even with the U.S. in recession. Yeah, yeah, only one sitting president has gone to term 2 while in recession, but Trump has upturned a lot of conventional thinking. If he can turn the narrative on China, which I think is possible, I think game theory supports the idea of him willing to accept a big economic hit going into 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the play.  SPY 295 November 15th puts, SPY 285 December 31st puts, and SPY 270 January 17th puts, and SPY 260 March 20th puts. Also, SPXU, SSG, and as a wildcard, Lynas Corp (aussie rare earth company) LYSCF. Maybe JNUG.

Increased Corruption and Market Misconduct,"Hi.

Just got an risk advisory from work (big bank) that says misconduct and market manipulation/insider trading has been occuring at all-time volume and frequency. Also bribes and other junk you're not supposed to do (if you're a pussy I guess). 

A little bit of mischief is great, but it sounds like people are getting antsy and desperate. That's a red flag for the market as a whole I would suspect.

Morning Briefing (9/13/2019),"# Market keeps riding trade news momentum

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade nine points, or 0.3%, above fair value as buying momentum looks to lift the stock market closer to all-time highs. The S&amp;P 500 enters today's session less than 20 points from that level, helped by a view that trade tensions will not worsen in the short term, U.S. consumer spending will support further growth, and that easy monetary policy will continue to favor equities. 

Today's trade news involves China's *Xinhua News Agency* confirming that China will encourage companies to buy certain agricultural products like pork and soybeans from the U.S. without being subject to additional tariffs. Separately, President Trump teased the idea that he would consider an interim agreement with Beijing but said he would rather have a complete deal.

Patient Tendies Strategy,"Yo guys I wanted to share a strategy that has been working pretty well for me and I think could help a lot of you autists out that are consistently losing money with smaller accounts or have shit luck with buying puts. This isn't some super obscure strategy and Im sure many of you play it or know about it. Basically every time one of these low float meme stonks like FSLY or BYND has a massive run up and just consolidates for a few days, I put a huge portion of my account into slightly ITM call credit spreads. Far enough ITM to skew the risk to reward ratio to about 1:1 or better depending on how retarded the run up was. I give myself time to be wrong so usually these spreads are anywhere from 40-100 days out. Yes, sometimes the bid/ask spread is absolute shit but it hasn't stopped me from acquiring tendies. Play it safe boys, try to do some research on lock up expirations, short float, announcements, volume, and options liquidity for the stock. Not all stocks fall just because of lockup expiration after a sizable run up from IPO, but after a ridiculous squeeze into the 200's on something like BYND, I feel pretty comfortable selling deep ITM spreads that are a few months out or less. If it drops massively in a short amount of time then you can net an easy 50% or just patiently wait until the spreads expire to collect the full credit. Be smart yoloing and take profits when you can because these things can randomly squeeze until their lockup expires or short interest massively decreases.

Don't just instantly yolo your whole account into BYND credit spreads from this post if you have no idea what you are doing, its price is still crazy but I haven't touched it since after the drop from high 160's, but will be keeping a close eye on it.

TLDR- sell ITM call credit spreads on meme stocks 40-100 days out after crazy run ups, be patient and wait for tendies.",bigdr1plikegodzilla,1568329573,9,14,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d3g38x/patient_tendies_strategy/

Ford stock will be worthless in a year - DD,"Our beloved American car company that has been around forever is a piece of absolute dog shit that will go bankrupt in the next year. Here's why

* 103 Billion in long term debt - Over the last 3 years this has increased by 12%
* 226 Billion in total liabilities - 10% increase in 3 years
* Ridiculous leverage ratio of 6
* Only 38 Billion in cash
* Losing about 1 billion in profit per year
* EPS is pure shit for the sector - PE ratio of 17 is triple that of GM and Honda

&amp;#x200B;

So what is keeping the stock value afloat?

* High dividend yield is appealing to old people who think this translates to ""secure long-term investment""
* 10 billion dollar investment in engineering new electric vehicles has investors hopes up
* Corporate restructuring - cutting costs with layoffs

&amp;#x200B;

Why it will crash and burn

* Recent Moody's downgrade to junk bond status will likely lead to further downgrades from Fitch and S&amp;P into junk bond status - stock value will drop significantly if this happens 
* Ford has already missed the boat on developing an electric only vehicle that will catch on with consumers - Fusion Plug in Hybrids are retarded because nobody wants to plug their car into an outlet every day and still have to buy gas. They will never develop a competitive electric vehicle. Overall Ford has shown a lack of innovation in their cars
* Ford Credit has issued 91 Billion dollars worth of new car loans. Given that the number of delinquent loans in the U.S. has been steadily increasing since 2011 and is at its highest level ever - this does not bode well for the credit division of Ford
* Decreasing vehicle sales in the last year - fears of recession will further decline number of new cars sold. Nobody is going out and buying a new car if they think they will lose their job soon
* Decreasing profits and EPS in the next year will lead to further stock devaluation

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Either short shares of Ford or buy puts dated for late next year/2021. This company is an overly leveraged dumpster fire

Morning Briefing (9/12/2019),"# ECB cuts rates; President Trump delays Oct. 1 tariff rate increase for two weeks

U.S. futures are up but are well off their highs that followed President Trump's announcement that he will delay the tariff rate increase on $250 billion of Chinese imports by two weeks. Currently, the S&amp;P 500 futures trade ten points, or 0.3%, above fair value after trading as high as 0.9% soon after the news.

Those goods are currently taxed at 25% and will now increase to 30% on Oct. 15 instead of Oct. 1, which would have coincided with the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. President Trump said his decision was a gesture of goodwill at the request of China's Vice Premier Liu He in front of the anniversary. China exempted certain U.S. products from a higher tariff rate yesterday.

Futures have recently ticked higher in the wake of the ECB's policy decision. The central bank lowered its deposit rate by ten basis points to -0.50% as expected. In addition, the ECB said net purchases of EUR 20 bln will be restarted in November and will end shortly before the bank begins to raise key interest rates. 

On the data front, investors will receive the Consumer Price Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 218,000) and Continuing Claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Treasury Budget for August will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries are slightly higher following the ECB decision. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.71%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.71. WTI crude ($55.22, -0.53, -1.0%) extends its losses from yesterday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ will not consider deeper production cuts until its next meeting in December. 

* **Oracle** (ORCL 55.23, -1.06): -1.9% after guiding Q2 EPS slightly below expectations and announcing CEO Mark Hurd will take a leave of absence for health reasons. Oracle also added $15 billion to its share buyback program. 
* **Baker Hughes, a GE Company** (BHGE 21.80, -0.49): -2.2% after **General Electric** (GE 9.33, -0.03, -0.3%) said it plans to reduce its stake in the company to 38.4% from 50.4%, raising$2.7 billion in the process, according to *Reuters*.

Major European indices trade near their flat lines ahead of the 7:45 ET release of the latest policy statement from the European Central Bank. The ECB is widely expected to lower the deposit facility rate by 10 bps to -0.50%, but it remains to be seen if ECB President, Mario Draghi, was able to convince policymakers to back a new asset purchase program. Germany's ifo Institute lowered its forecast for 2019 German GDP growth to 0.5% from 0.6% and cut the 2020 outlook to 1.2% from 1.7%. The Institute expects that Q3 GDP will show the second consecutive quarter of falling output, followed by a slight recovery in Q4. The British government released its worst-case assumptions about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. The government expects an increase in protests, higher electricity prices, and freight delays.

Why this Uber/Lyft labor bill stuff is just plain stupid,"Is it just me or are the drivers picking a fight they going to lose no matter what? If the bill gets approved, Lyft or Uber could easily just stop drivers from getting rides if they detect the drivers are nearing 40 hours of drive time and thus keep them as contractors. I fail to see the why these drivers are pushing for employee status when in the end it is going to result in a shittier deal for a larger amount of them and a marginally improved deal for a small amount of them, with less freedom. Do these people not realize they’re about to make themselves full time taxi drivers?

The DD here is that Im doubtful this bill is going to go into effect when Lyft/Uber have some very smart people that should be illustrating this to the legislators.

How to short NYC?,"Might be a shit post but something I've been seeing is that NYC economy is dying for local NYC residents. It might seem okay from any outside view but when you touch base at what's actually going on here, it looks like the city had been undergoing recession for quite a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Real estate(rent/purchase) is too expensive for the average family. Even in the outer boroughs, you're looking at least $1300 rent for a 1 bedroom in a bad area. Keep in mind this is the lowest rent on the private market that you'll get. Many New Yorkers are spending more than half of their income on just shelter alone. Low income housing is flooded featuring several families there with long waitlists with over 160,000 people waiting for a spot. NYCHA is severely underfunded and not building enough homes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Business are dying primarily with the higher cost of rent and increasing minimum wage putting pressure all around them. NYC residents are so focused in tying their budgets to the high rent that they're not buying enough products for their homes causing more business to dye off quickly. All you see is a lot of small pop-up shops and restaurants that will only be there for a year or two before they close down again to the next pop-up shop.

&amp;#x200B;

Landlords aren't even leasing commercial or retail space much because they don't even want to get tied down to a ""low"" rent"". Leading to lots of vacancies in some prime residential areas.

&amp;#x200B;

 Manhattan real estate value is decreasing dramatically due to the already overwhelming price of living there and the new units coming into supply. Also for the first time in history,NYC is losing population in crazy numbers. Within the past year, NYC has seen over 200k people leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering, if there is an ETF or stock that focuses on NYC local economy to short it.

Within our games, we offer live services, including micro transactions, downloadable content, subscriptions, and esports, that provide additional depth and engagement opportunities for our players. Our live services net revenue comprised 40% of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2018 and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business. Our most popular live service is the Ultimate Team mode associated with our sports franchises. Ultimate Team allows players to collect and trade current and former professional players in order to build, and compete as, a personalized team. Net revenue from Ultimate Team represented approximately 21 percent, 16 percent and 15 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a substantial portion of which was derived from FIFA Ultimate Team.

...

The increased importance of live services revenue to our business heightens the risks associated with our limited product portfolio. Live services that are either poorly-received or provided in connection with under performing games may generate lower than expected sales. Any lapse, delay or failure in our ability to provide high-quality live services content to consumers over an extended period of time could materially and adversely affect our financial results, consumer engagement with our live services, and cause harm to our reputation and brand. Our most popular live service is the Ultimate Team mode associated with our sports franchises. **Any events or circumstances that negatively impact our ability to reliably provide content or sustain engagement for Ultimate Team, particularly FIFA Ultimate Team, would negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent.**

"Serious question about ACB earnings, and concern over autists:","Honestly, how the fuck do any of you see this stock going up?   
Since early this year, they've said they expect positive EBITDA in Q4 2019.   
1.  Q2 results on Feb 11, 2019

2. Q3 results on May 14, 2019.

3. Guidance in which they literally already fucking told us the Revenue numbers on August 6. But, more importantly, saying they're ""tracking"" towards EBITDA and ""more importantly, adjusted EBITDA"". This... does not sound good.  


Last time they guided revenue early, it was (unbelievably, wow, who woulda guessed) in the middle of the given range.   
The stock has, as part of a mild sector turnaround, gained 20%+ this month. In the past, the company made expensive acquisitions and burned cash, leading to 1.2B shares outstanding. That goodwill doe.   


So, given we already know the fucking numbers and the market has priced this in (yes, folks, if news is released a fucking month before the ER, the stock is not gonna jump on ER date if it hits those numbers), if they're ""tracking EBIDTA"" is anything mediocre, this is going down.   


Seriously. How do you people think a stock goes up when  PRE RELEASED information occurs, not to mention the people who's money moves stock already new this information before the official company release. Think a little.

Undervalued Utah Chemical Corporation,"Hello retards, I'm back with another DD.  This one's pretty short; I entered into a big long position on Huntsman Corp (HUN) that I think should be between twice and three times as expensive as it is now.  

Before I go into my DD, I want to talk about the MNK analysis I did a bit less than a month ago.  As you probably know, MNK went caput pretty promptly after I bought stock.  I didn't spend enough time making sure I understood the nature of their opioid law suits, and I probably should have talked to someone with a JD about whether MNK was allowed to complete the spin-off of a new Mallinkrodt from Sonorant Therapeutics that I found so attractive.  If anyone lost money off my DD, I'm sorry.  Okay, here we go with HUN.

Family-run chemical company HUN was about 2 bucks a share after the financial crisis because they were going to get bought until their buyers pulled out because the whole stock market died.  Since then, the tightly-managed chemical firm has consistently proved to investors that they're still worth their salt.  The stock has rebounded to around 22 bucks since then, which is pretty phenomenal, but they're not done.  

One event stands out to me as a reason to invest ASAP.  Last month, HUN sold its chemical intermediates and surfactants units to Thai firm Indorama Ventures.  These units are considered by analysts to be the flabbiest of HUN's assets, so it makes sense to sell them to someone who can give them the focus they need.  The units comprised about 20% of HUN's business at the time, and they sold for $2 billion.  

HUN stock, in the mid-low 20s right now, is super cheap, then.  It's got a market cap of five and a quarter billion when it should objectively be at least 8 and probably more.  Remember that the chemical intermediates and surfactants were their least profitable assets, so I'd say HUN's market cap should really be around 11 or 12 billion.  

I'm hoping it'll work its way up to 45-60 some time in the next couple years, which seems like a fair price.  Let me know what you guys think.",boison024,1568221455,34,26,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2tdcm/undervalued_utah_chemical_corporation/

Morning Briefing (9/11/2019),"# Drifting on value-based rotation

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade three points, or 0.1%, above fair value. Masked behind two straight days of ""flat"" sessions in the benchmark index has been a rotation into value stocks from momentum stocks. 

Today, much like the prior two days, hasn't included any market-moving news that has altered the market's improved sentiment on trade and growth. On Wednesday, China released a list of several U.S. products that will be exempted from the increased tariff rate, starting on Sept. 17 for one year. Soybeans and pork were not included. 

U.S. Treasury yields have been on the rise recently as part of a broader effort to reduce exposure to crowded trades. **Charles Schwab** (**SCHW** 41.55, -0.40, -1.0%), meanwhile, is set to cut roughly 3% of its staff to reduce some pressure from yields that remain relatively low, according to *The Wall Street Journal*.  

Currently, the 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 98.62. WTI crude is up 1.2%, or $0.71, to $58.11/bbl. 

On the data front, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 8:30 a.m. ET and Wholesale Inventories for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) at 10:00 a.m. ET. The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index increased 2.0% following a 3.1% decline in the prior week.

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **Amazon** (AMZN 1808.38, -12.17): -0.7% amid a broader effort to rotate out of growth stocks. *Bloomberg* also reported that Amazon is being probed by antitrust officials from the FTC. 
* **Charles Schwab** (SCHW 41.55, -0.40): -1.0% following a report from *The Wall Street Journal* that it will cut roughly 3% of its staff amid falling interests. The stock was also up over 16% since Aug. 27. 
* **RH** (RH 154.00, -4.88): -3.1% despite beating top and bottom-line estimates and raising its full-year guidance above consensus.
* **Dave &amp; Buster's** (PLAY 36.98, -6.74): -15.4% after lowering its FY20 guidance. Dave &amp; Buster's beat earnings expectations.

**Asia &amp; Europe detail:**

*Asia: Nikkei +1.0%, Hang Seng +1.8%, Shanghai -0.4%*

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended the midweek session on a mixed note. China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange removed investment quotas for qualified foreign institutional investors, likely due to low liquidity. *The Wall Street Journal* pointed out that foreign investment in China was below the maximum allowed level prior to this change. South Korea's exports through the first ten days of September increased 7.2% yr/yr due to higher shipments of wireless devices, vehicles, and appliances. Semiconductor exports, meanwhile, were down 33.3%. South Korea's unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since early 2014 as the number of employed jumped 452,000 yr/yr. This was the largest increase in employment since March 2017. National Australia Bank expects 50 bps of rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia by February.

Decent growth with DCF that would put it around $42-48 based on variables

Stock just broke out today above several resistance levels on decent volume

Stock is deep value at this point, extremely oversold. Down way more than the peer group on TTM basis. Just look at last quarters top sellers from 13F filings... literally all large institutions dumping to re rate.

The stock is significantly undervalued relative to peer group on all major valuations basis FY1 P/E, EV/EBITDA, etc.

Stock has been mentioned several times on CNBC in last couple weeks. 

There are 100% risks to the sector from an oversupply and pricing perspective, but they just committed to slowing the pipeline and reducing jobs (first in the sector to do so). 

Stock is destined for a rebound as its trading well below historical valuations. 

Right now, I’m levered up in common stock. I will be looking for opportunities to opportunistically buy vertical call spreads for additional upside and selling medium-term calls on my common stock position until it reaches my price target.

"AIMT Peanut ""Update""","If yall followed my last post you'd know that you'd be up 60% since Monday.

Today's your last chance to either crash or moon on AIMT before the briefing documents come out.  (This friday is the actual meeting though)

DD

Efficacy: It works. Touching a peanut, won't kill you anymore for most kids.  4-17  You can even eat a little bit like a bite of peanut butter sandwich.

Safety shmafety:  You got more systemic allergic reactions, sure, but you at least know where it's coming from and you got your epi

This drug is to protect kids from unintentional ingestion of peanuts.   Yea, that kid that died because he was on the same slide as a kid munching on trail mix?  No more.  First kiss cause you death cause she kissed another boy eating peanuts?  Enough.

Know how many kids are deathly allergic to peanuts?  Like a million in the USA.  You charge 10k per year for this you got 10bil in rev.  30% will likely come off cause it causes side effects.  You got DBVT's peanut patch competitor on the horizon.  Another 50% of that.  Take off another 50% just because and you still got 1.75b.

Current market cap is 1.37b.

Bruh, you do the math.  Nothing on the market currently for peanut allergy and AIMT got egg allergy in the pipe.

I'mma lay my pipe how you think it is.  Due to IV it may make more sense to not buy Options at this point as the 25 strikes are now already $2.00.  Lookin at a positive advisory committee post price of 28.  30s might be a bit too optimistic but it has hit this before.

On September 23rd, Bakkt is going live with their future contracts of digital gold coin currency stuff, daily settled and monthly.  Bakkt is founded by ICE (the parent company of the NYSE also) and is backed by massive corporations, including Starbucks and Microsoft. Their goal is for people to use digital currency over their network in their everyday life. Imagine paying for Starbucks or buying overpriced software with digital bits. 

Insutitional money is starting to flow into this space from coinbase 200+ mil a month and Bakkt and ICE will only amplify this.

Apple announcing the acquisition of Snapchat today?,"For those who don't follow unusual options activity, large swaths of call option contracts were purchased last week, yesterday, and today for Snapchat -- thousands of OTM contracts that expire this Friday and next Friday. Snap was flying high last week, but yesterday Snap fell roughly 8% and today it's down another 4% -- yet more large blocks of calls are being purchased well out of the money, expiring within days. They're not part of a straddle.

Someone has conviction and/or a gambling issue (maybe both?).

Anyway, who's buying these calls? More important, what catalyst could be coming for Snapchat, if any? Well, I think Apple will announce that the ""one more thing today"" is the acquisition of Snapchat. Here's why:

\- Apple sent out a press invitation announcing today's event with a 3Dish Apple logo with 5 colors. People always look for clues in these invites -- the 3Dish appearance and the colors are clues. The 3D is probably alluding to the push into AR -- Apple thinks AR is the future, as does Snap.

[https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/29/apple-event-invite-speculation/](https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/29/apple-event-invite-speculation/)

There are 5 colors -- these 5 colors are the same exact colors Snapchat uses in their branding guidelines. You can see it right here: [https://kit.snapchat.com/docs/design-guidelines](https://kit.snapchat.com/docs/design-guidelines)

Look at the comparison: [https://imgur.com/a/c9gWHyQ](https://imgur.com/a/c9gWHyQ)

Yellow is Snap's primary color, obviously -- which is centered in the Apple icon in the invitation -- and the other 4 colors are the other 4 colors that Snap uses in design elements. No more, no less.

\- Evan, $SNAP founder, has fought off being acquired up to this point, but it's no secret Snapchat has had an uphill battle for monetization and the stock has gone no where. The company value/stock isn't even in the ""floundering like Uber/Lyft"" range, it's hanging out in the ""LOL we gunna git you Gamestop"" range.

Snap has put up a good fight. It's okay to sell now.

\- Most analysts think $SNAP will be purchased within the next 1-2 years by Apple or Amazon. Whoever ends up purchasing Snap, they'll need to be able to market their own services/products directly to Snap's users to be able to justify the purchase and extract the most value out of the acquisition. Third-party ads aren't enough, as Snap knows.

\- Snap is the instant social network that Apple has long wanted. Apple knows they can't create one from scratch without burning a mountain of cash anyway -- even if they do, there's no guarantee a new social network (see Google's 14 attempts). Apple knows they have to buy their way into an existing social network.

\- Sexting jokes aside, Snapchat has a great fit for Apple's brand. Snapchat has a great demographic for Apple's products and services, a devote following, a relatively scandal-free history, and a very simple UX, which I think is the most important for Apple aside from the users. It's a blank canvas in more ways than one for Apple to do its thing.

\- Apple is pushing its new and/or improved subscription services -- music, tv, games -- the more social it can make each one and the more integrated they can make it all, the more traction and success each one will have. People want to listen to music ""together,"" watch TV together, and it's especially true that people want to play games together w/ friends.

Imagine logging into an Apple-owned Snapchat -- ""Kelly is listening to X on Apple Music"" click here to listen/subscribe, ""Kelly is watching Y"" click here to watch/subscribe, ""Kelly is playing Z on Apple Games"" click here to play/subscribe. Apple could go a step further and detect the music being played in the background video uploaded to Snapchat -- an extremely common thing -- and offer the name/link to that song in Apple Music. That's great monetization.

\- Apple has +/- $300b in the bank. Snap would probably go for $30-$50b. Okay.

\- Evan has a picture of Steve Jobs hanging in his office, allegedly. He loves Apple, at least its founder, allegedly.

\- That last point was really piss-poor DD. It's Wallstreetbets though, so I figured I'd throw it in. While I'm at it, I think I heard Evan ate an apple the other day. Coincidence? I doubt it.

\- Once two companies announce a merger/acquisition, you can typically go back through public comments/statements made by the companies months leading up to the announcement and see a lot of similarities. Both Snap and Apple have talked a lot about AR ""being the future"" lately. Among other AR-projects, rumors are that Apple has a Tile-like competitor being announced today that will visually show you where your item is in your house. Snap just announced AR glasses.

\- Speaking of Snap's AR glasses, [https://www.spectacles.com/](https://www.spectacles.com/) \-- this site/design doesn't fit with the styling or feel of Snapchat's other web properties (like [Snapchat.com](https://snapchat.com/)) -- it feels more like something that was produced with Apple. You could add an Apple logo to every page and Apple wouldn't change much else after an acquisition. Scroll through [Spectacles.com](https://spectacles.com/) and then scroll through product pages on [Apple.com](https://apple.com/), it feels incredibly similar.

\- Apple was recently asked why they're hiring engineers in Seattle -- Apple gave no comment. Snap also has a growing office in Seattle, presumably for AR -- they're hiring a lot of engineers for that office right now. There's absolutely no way two tech companies are hiring engineers in Seattle at the same time... /s

TLDR: Buy puts today, Apple ain't buying Snapchat cause some colors match up. If it does though, and it's Apple's ""one last thing,"" then you heard it here first.",ilovevyvanse,1568132908,91,86,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2a2oc/apple_announcing_the_acquisition_of_snapchat_today/

Morning Briefing (9/10/2019),"# Little movement in front of big events

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade six points, or 0.2%, below fair value after a flat day yesterday. Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.

For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.

At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to **Apple's** (**AAPL** 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it is expected to unveil its latest iPhone. 

In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.

U.S. Treasuries are slightly lower, nudging yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.45. WTI crude is up 1.0% to $58.42/bbl, which could continue to benefit the oil-sensitive energy stocks that have bounced back this month. 

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **Apple** (AAPL 213.73, -0.44): -0.2% ahead of its annual Special Event at 1:00 p.m. ET. 
* **Wendy's** (WEN 20.00, -1.95): -8.9% after lowering its earnings guidance to reflect costs incurred to launch a breakfast menu in 2020. 
* **Ford Motor** (F 9.19, -0.35): -3.7% after Moody's downgraded its senior unsecured rating to Ba1, or ""junk rating,"" from Baa3. 

Reviewing overnight developments:

* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note. Japan's Nikkei +0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng UNCH, China's Shanghai Composite -0.1%, India's Sensex Closed for Moharram, South Korea's Kospi +0.6%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.5%.

      * Japan's flash August Machine Tool Orders -37.1% yr/yr (last -33.0%)
      * Australia's August NAB Business Confidence 1 (last 4
      * New Zealand's August Electronic Card Retail Sales +1.1% m/m (last -0.1%); +2.8% yr/yr (last 1.6%)
   * In news:
      * China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage.
      * Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position. Bloomberg noted that this was the first time that a Chinese local government financing vehicle did not exercise a call option on its debt.
      * North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials.
* Major European indices trade mostly lower. STOXX Europe 600 -0.3%, Germany's DAX +0.2%, U.K.'s FTSE 100 -0.1%, France's CAC 40 -0.2%, Italy's FTSE MIB -0.4%, Spain's IBEX 35 -0.1%.

**Asia &amp; Europe detail:**

*Asia: Nikkei +0.4%, Hang Seng unch, Shanghai -0.1%*

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note. China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage. Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position. *Bloomberg* noted that this was the first time that a Chinese local government financing vehicle did not exercise a call option on its debt. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials.

Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region began the week on a higher note. China reported its trade figures for August, showing a smaller than expected surplus of $34.83 bln (expected $43.00 bln) as exports declined 1.0% yr/yr (expected +2.0%) while imports fell 5.6% yr/yr (expected -6.0%). The People's Bank of China was expected to refinance loans issued through a medium-term lending facility today, but it refrained from making that move. The Bank of Korea cautioned that South Korea's potential GDP will fall at a faster rate than previously expected due to a decreasing number of eligible workers as the country's population ages. *South China Morning Post* reported that Air China has no plans to acquire Cathay Pacific.

$TLRD 100%+ in a year,"TLRD's stock market price action has been acting like the company is going to go bankrupt. Yet the bond market has been trading its '22 debt at or above par recently. Recent positive news includes:

\- sale of non-core business

\- upward EPS revision

\- very detailed buyout rumor at roughly double the avg share price over the past 2 weeks: [https://twitter.com/JonathanWexler3/status/1164205831904256000](https://twitter.com/JonathanWexler3/status/1164205831904256000).

\- partnership with the NFL:  [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190903005193/en/Tailored-Brands-Enters-Licensed-Collaboration-NFL](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190903005193/en/Tailored-Brands-Enters-Licensed-Collaboration-NFL)  ""We are excited to work with Tailored Brands,” said Michelle Micone, Senior Vice President of Consumer Products of the National Football League, “and offer our fans something **they’ve long been asking for** through a licensing agreement with brands who continue to be recognized as **the industry leaders in men’s custom clothing**.” 

This is important for several reasons. 

1) The NFL is hinting there is strong market demand for this product. Marketing hasn't even begun, but by the end of this NFL season, you can expect that every fan will know about the next coming of Men's Wearhouse and JAB. This is important because all the deep value models pre-NFL-partnership had TLRD valued much higher than its current value, but **assumed decreasing sales**.

There's now a good chance that sales will actually increase in the near-future thanks to the exclusive NFL partnership, and any other partnerships that may come down the pipe. If you plug growing sales into these models, a ten bagger is not out of the question.

**Remember, 33%-50% of Americans call themselves NFL fans.**

2) Despite all the chatter on the fashion snob pockets of the internet, Men's Wearhouse and JAB are still recognized by mainstream America as the leaders in formalwear. This hints that TLRD will likely form more partnerships with major sports leagues, and they are the **only** company with enough market power and street cred to get these kinds of deals. In Warren Buffett parlance, they are growing their moat.

\---

**What about the bear case?**

\- Workplace casual is going to kill TLRD...right? Well, no. The workplace casual trend has been in play for over a decade now, and yet MW sales have had periods of significant growth throughout this period. This is clear evidence that the workplace is not the dominant factor in MW sales. There will always be weddings, black tie events, funerals, proms, lawyers, bar mitzvahs, etc.

\- Men's Wearhouse is lame compared to \[insert fashion snob's preferred suit retailer here\]. There are two problems with this. First, most American men are not fashion snobs. When you subtract the population of fashion snobs from the population of American men, you still have a huge population that needs suits.

Second, Men's Wearhouse has a high-quality line of **made-in-America** suits by Joseph Abboud, who even the fashion snobs agree, have quality that stands up to the trendier suit makers. And in today's political climate, you cannot underestimate the power of made-in-America.",invest2018,1567995144,10,29,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1kli8/tlrd_100_in_a_year/

FSLY Short Squeeze potential,"A few people have asked me to look into FSLY's prospects as a short squeeze so here is what I have found. I go off of S3's data since it seems to be the most accurate. As recently as August 23rd, FSLY short interest was 4.7m shares, or approximately 54% of the float. The borrow fee was negligible, however, at just 1.61%. 

Since then, however, things have gotten more interesting. S3 put it on their list of top borrow fees. The short interest is now 61.7% of the float and the borrow fee has gone up to 57.9% as of this past Friday. 

I don't know a TON about Fastly's business other than they describe it as an edge cloud platform but it looks to be mostly a CDN. As in, they host sites and data for other businesses around the world in order to give their customers' faster loading times. They also upsell services and security. Big competitor in the space is AKAM. I don't know enough to say one is better than the other. But to me it looks to be a space that requires a decent amount of capital investment and has some well funded competitors. That likely explains the short interest. As with my prior short squeeze plays, I like that. Because it means the shorts will be stubborn and want to short more on valuation concerns until the borrow rate rises enough to squeeze them out of their position.

"Since I angered some Chads on /r/investing here's why I think China is the next ""big short"".","Fellow idiots,

I posted [this comment](https://i.imgur.com/av1WTXI.png) which seems to have angered the highly sophisticated /r/investing community. I don't mind being downvoted but at least provide some counter arguments if you're going to be a dick. So in the pursuit of truth and tendies for all, I have prepared some juicy due diligence (DD) for WSB Capital on why China is on the verge of collapse.

TL;DR at the bottom.


**Point 1:**
Defaults in China have [been accelerating aggressively](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-07/china-defaults-hit-record-in-2018-the-2019-pace-is-triple-that), and [through July 2019, 274 real estate developers filed for bankruptcy, up 50%](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3020099/bankruptcies-among-chinese-developers-are-half-amid-slowing-economy) over last year. A bonus? Many Chinese state controlled banks have been filing for bankruptcy as well. Just google ""china bank defaults"" or something similar. Notice how many articles there are from 2019? When the banking system fails, everything else usually fails too.


**Point 2:**
[The RMB has depreciated significantly](https://i.imgur.com/JeyxVSD.png). Last time this happened, in 2015-2016, there was a significant outflow of foreign invested capital. According to the IIF, [outflows reached $725bn due to the currency depreciation.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emerging-china-iif/china-net-2016-outflows-at-record-725-billion-iif-idUSKBN15H1FL). This time is different why again? I have heard some arguments why there will be less outflow this time, but I struggle to buy them.



**Point 3:**
Despite wanting to operate like a developed economy, China still has not been able to shrug off the [middle income trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_income_trap). Their GDP per capita is comparable to countries we [normally associated with being developing/emerging markets](https://i.imgur.com/O3rVFZF.png). Tangentially related to point 10.


**Point 4:**
China is an export-dependent economy, with [about 20% of their exports contributing towards their GDP](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/China/Exports/). Less exporting means less GDP, less consumption (because businesses make less money, they pay people less, who in turn spend less), which has a greater effect on GDP than any declines in exports would have at face value. Guess what? [Chinese exports dropped 1% in August](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/08/chinas-exports-to-us-fell-16percent-in-august-as-trump-escalates-trade-war.html), and [August imports dropped -1%, marking the 5th month this year of negative m/m export growth.](https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/event/49ec580e-7985-4efb-afb8-7edcbd64685a).

**Point 5:**
Business [confidence has been weak in China](https://i.imgur.com/oe1UtC5.png) - declining at a sustained pace worse than in 2015. When businesses feel worse, they spend less, invest less in fixed assets, hire less until they feel better about the future. Which takes me to my next point.

**Point 6:** [Fixed asset investment in China has declined 30 *percentage points* since 2010](https://i.imgur.com/yy8Md2j.png). While rates are low, confidence is also low, and they are sitting on a record amount of leverage, which means they simply will not be able to afford additional investment.

**Point 7:** They are an extremely levered economy with a [total debt to GDP ratio of over 300%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-debt/chinas-debt-tops-300-of-gdp-now-15-of-global-total-iif-idUSKCN1UD0KD), per the IIF, which also accounts for roughly 15% of *global total fucking debt*. Here's an interview with [someone else talking about it too](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/chinas-debt-levels-amid-its-slowing-economy.html).

**Point 8:** Their central bank recently introduced a [metric fuckton of stimulus into their economy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-06/china-cuts-banks-reserve-ratio-to-ramp-up-easing-support). This will encourage more borrowing....add fuel to the fire. Moreover, the stimulus will mechanically likely weaken the RMB even more, which could lead to even more foreign outflows, which are already happening, see next point. 

**Point 9:** Fucking LOTS of outflows this year. As of MAY, according to [this joint statement](https://www.amcham-shanghai.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/Joint_survey_on_tariffs_May_2019.pdf), around 40% of US companies are relocating some portion of their supply chains away from mainland. This was in May. Since May, we have seen even more tariffs imposed, why WOULD companies want to stay when exporting to the US is a lot more expensive now?

**Point 10:** Ignoring ALL of the points above, we are in a global synchronized slowdown, with [many emerging market central banks cutting rates - by the most in a decade](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/EMERGING-RATES-FACTBOX/0H001QETE864/index.html). Investors want safety, and [safe-haven](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2018/12/13/safe-haven-currencies.html) denominated assets are where we have seen a lot of flocking into recently. Things that can be considered safe-havens have good liquidity, a relatively stable economy, and a predictable political environment.

Would love to hear opposing thoughts if you think China is a good buy. I am not against China, nor any other country for that matter, but I am against losing money (yes, wrong sub etc.), and I can not rationalize why anyone would be putting in a bid.

For Options Traders,"Somewhat of a roller coaster month of options and ER. Below are some of the option picks that I feel are discounted and worth looking into:

Gold: Holistically down 8% on average from this week.

* GOLD
* AUY
* HMY
* NUGT
* JNUG
* EGO

Gold for me is a definite buy as options are slashed 80% from highs. Low risk, high rewards as it usually inverses SPY. Spy looking a bit beefed up with ""trade war optimism"". Not sure why we are optimistic seeing that Trump boasted about ""trade talks going very well"" on multiple occasions only to be a bearer of terrible news the follow day or even hours. 

Cannabis: Cannabis sector have also taken a huge hit. Down 12% holistically. 

* OGI
* CGC
* HEXO
* MEDIF
* Of course big brother TLRY

Cannabit sector is a huge opportunity for buy in especially at slashed prices. Historically they get 10-15% pumps intraday or 15-20% intraweek once the ball gets rolling. Can't hurt to go long seeing as this industry is starting to optimize distribution, products, overhead costs - and policy makers are becoming more lenient with CBD treatments in school (Controversial, but a good win for this industry nonetheless).",TripleBrain,1567790909,16,51,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0jqic/for_options_traders/

VPY / VPYYF - Software Company to the MOON,"VersaPay 
(VPY - Toronto Stock Venture Exchange)
(VPYYF - OTC)

Fellow autists, on a random tip from a client, I have learned about a little $72MM company based out of Toronto called VersaPay. 

This company utilizes their proprietary accounts receivable software to facilitate DIGITAL B2B payments. In case you guys didn’t know, the majority of all business to business payments is still done via check. VersaPay is looking to move this process to the cloud. 

BULL CASE:
-Approximately 88-100% top line growth YOY
-Recently announced partnership with MasterCard 
-White labeled the product through RBC (a 5% penetration into RBC’s client base would be approximately $100MM in revenue for VersaPay)
-Insulated from major trade war issues due to all revenue being in Canada and the US
-Huge market potential with large US companies
-Proven leadership team with no felons or shady people in the C-suite 

CURRENT STOCK PRICE, $1.60 CAD
-Price targets of $3.75, $4, $2, and $2.30

BEAR CASE:
-Unable to gain traction in the space, there are a few competitors 
-Somewhat high cash burn rate (though not crazy)



This is a pretty rare opportunity to get a growth stock that trades at approximately 8x revenue for 2019. This is a compelling risk reward opportunity.",Willer1377,1567783745,0,17,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0i6hy/vpy_vpyyf_software_company_to_the_moon/

I’ve been trading stocks and forex for a living for a couples of years now, over the last week I’ve been making a lot of plays on ULTA just due to the volatility and the easy money all except one went my way according to my technical analysis. 

The bottom yesterday came in an area that has been a support the last year and a half. The bounce from this level was typically very quick as was shown with the climb yesterday and today. Due to this and the volatility along with the fact that the stock was oversold the sell off was a bit exaggerated, we are now in the perfect position for it to continue upwards. I’m looking to get out above $240 but will be watching the 20 sma on the 1 minute to see when to truly get out.",maid113,1567741168,23,58,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0bctb/first_options_play_20_240_96_ulta_calls/
FB dating and what it means for Match ($MTCH) [WSB exclusive][DD][Serious][OC],"There are lots of FB dating think pieces out there. I've been thinking about this all day, here's what i think it comes down to:

first this isn't a winner take all market, there are different sectors and demos and FB will probably cater to a specific one. i'm guessing more of a traditional MF relationship 30+ demo, which would make it a match.com / PoF / okcupid competitor, but we have yet to see. for the free user there's no real harm in having multiple profiles.next is the revenue piece. no word on this costing anything. FB has the advantage of being able to monetize without charging the users. so the question is, will FB dating cause match (mostly tinder) subscribers to unsub? if the demo isn't the same, then i think the answer is not significantly. primary source of revenue is male tinder subscribers, so taking all of this into account there are two important questions:

1. **will female tinder users leave in favor of FB?**
2. **will male tinder subscribers unsubscribe in favor of FB?**

i believe 2 would follow 1, but 1 doesn't necessarily follow 2. so then, if the answer to either of these questions is YES (in significant numbers) then we can't long MTCH as this will begin to hurt their bottom line. **some notes**

1. FB is only launching in the US, with a promise to launch in europe at a later time
2. the biggest threat to MTCH is a free FB dating product that female tinder users prefer, leaving no reason for men to subscribe
3. ongoing international growth in MTCH could help even all this out if the unsubs aren't too large
4. continued investment in new properties or properties outside FB demo could also help

**final thoughts**

* MTCH is the current undisputed leader in the space, but upstarts like Bumble are already encroaching on their territory. FB launch makes this a bigger risk.
* I still believe Zuck to be a robot incapable of delivering a product that attracts significant usage. Has has tried and failed at this before, but not in the US.
* Along with the IAC spinoff, holding MTCH will be a bumpy ride for the next few months. But it could also create a delicious buying opportunity. I am currently not invested but will be watching very closely.",keen4e,1567718815,19,44,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0748j/fb_dating_and_what_it_means_for_match_mtch_wsb/

WoW classic, one of the most popular sub base games to ever come out got remastered. the amount of old heads re buying a sub to play the game will also be enormous.

The company issued upside Q3 EPS guidance which is expected to come in a range of $0.46-0.51, excluding non-recurring items (versus the $0.46 consensus estimate with comparable same-store sales expected to be flat to up 1.0%) while lowering full-year 2020 EPS to a range of $2.29-2.41 (from $2.31-2.42) on revenue of $5.16-5.19B (from $5.19-5.24B). If you joined yesterday’s Schwab Live Daily webcast, “Today’s Option Market Recap” you might recall that MIK was highlighted for heavy activity (\~31K contracts) on the October 18th 7.50 call. Calls are outpacing puts better than 5:1 with the October 18th 7.50 call topping the most actives list (volume is 3,908).
* **Navistar International Corp. (NAV + $1.04 to $22.90):** The truck and diesel engine maker reported fiscal Q3 earnings of $1.56 per share ($0.35 beat) on revenue that rose 16.0% year-over-year to $3.02B (above the $2.92B expected). The company reaffirmed full-year 2019 revenue guidance of $11.25-11.75B with adjusted EBITDA expected to come in a range of $875-925M. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with the September 6th 22.00 call garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 161).

Several stocks are also trading to the upside on analyst upgrades/price target increases:

* **Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI + $2.24 to $53.30):** BMO Capital Markets upgraded the videogame maker to “Outperform” from “Market Perform” and increased their price target to $60.00 from $43.00; call volume is dominating (7:1 over puts) with the October 18th 55.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 5,284).  
* **Campbell Soup Co. (CPB + $0.62 to $46.05):** Piper Jaffray upgraded the food company to “Neutral” from “Underweight” and bumped their price target to $45.00 from $40.00, citing better focus and reinvestment in key brands; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the November 15th 43.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 86).
* **Roku Inc. (ROKU + $7.50 to $164.38):** D.A. Davidson hiked their price target on the streaming device maker to a street-high $185.00 from $135.00, citing the company’s “ability to exploit the billions being spent across the industry on proprietary content” and the “international advertising-based video on demand market opportunity”; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:3 with the September 6th 162.50 call leading the way (volume is 4,878).

New 52-week highs (120 new highs today): **American Tower Corp. (AMT + $2.24 to $240.08), CME Group Inc. (CME + $1.72 to $219.48), Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE - $1.36 to $224.20), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT + $0.61 to $115.25)**

**Notable Call Activity**

Some heavy call activity (\~100:1 over puts) is coming up on the radar on **FireEye Inc. (FEYE + $0.23 to $13.23)** as all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts are calls. Topping the list is the September 13th 13.50 call (volume is 10,753 vs. open interest of 261) which mostly consisted of various mid-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask prices of $0.28 and $0.29 (suggesting bullish intent).  

**JD.com Inc. (JD + $0.45 to $29.90):** Calls are outpacing puts roughly 4:1 as option traders primarily target the September 6th 30.00 call. Volume on this contract is 9,305 versus open interest of 1,369, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought for between $0.42 and $0.49 each, which suggests bullish intent.  

**Today’s Bearish Activity** 

Shares of **Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN - $5.20 to $88.09)** are under pressure after the meat processor lowered guidance which the company is attributing to short-term challenges which include “margin compression related to a reversal of a gain on mark to market grain derivatives recognized in our third quarter, commodity market volatility, implementation of enhanced food safety initiatives, a beef processing plant fire and slower than expected operational improvements in the chicken segment”. As a result of these challenges the company lowered full-year 2019 adjusted EPS to a range of $5.30-5.70 from $5.75-6.10 (the consensus estimate is currently $5.97). Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 5:2 which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 6th 82.00 put (volume is 3,805).

Also trading to the downside is **Starbucks Corp. (SBUX - $3.33 to $93.44)** after the coffee giant said that it expects its full-year 2020 EPS growth to be “meaningfully below” the growth model of at least 10% growth (vs. +10.2% estimate) at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailer Conference earlier this morning. Commenting on the guidance Starbuck’s CFO Patrick Grismer stated, “We elected to pull forward about $2B worth of share repurchases that we had originally planned for fiscal 2020 into fiscal 2019”. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the September 6th 93.50 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 2,479).

New 52-week lows (26 new lows today): **American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO - $2.20 to $14.07), Esperion Therapeutics Inc. (ESPR - $1.31 to $33.61), The Lovesac Company (LOVE - $0.83 to $15.66), Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (SRPT + $1.80 to $88.56)**

**Notable Put Activity**

Some unusual put activity (\~22:1 over calls) is being seen in the **iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF (EWH + $1.02 to $23.71)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the October 18th 23.00 put. Volume on this contract is 12,436 (vs. open interest of 7,666) which mostly consisted of two 5K blocks that were bought at separate times at the ask price of $0.55. Given the open interest figure of 7,666 we can be fairly certain that at least one of these 5K blocks is a new (bearish) position.  

Also seeing some heavy put activity (\~10:1 over calls) is **Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX + $0.69 to $107.69)** which is primarily being driven by a couple of fairly large blocks that simultaneously traded on the January 2020 expiration:

* 100.00 put – a 1,500 block was bought for $4.40 (open interest is 86)
* 90.00 put – a 1,500 block was sold for $2.20 (open interest is 149)

We know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a $10.00-wide bear put spread was established for a net debit of $2.20 (X 1,500 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes that MLNX will close below the break-even price of $97.80 at expiration.

**Volume Signals** 

**General Electric Co. (GE + $0.38 to $8.71):** The fourth most actively traded option contract across the board today is the October 18th 7.00 put as volume is 46,339 (vs. open interest of 143,990) which nearly entirely consisted of two 22.75K blocks that traded around the same time – one of the 22.75K blocks was bought at the ask price of $0.08 while the other 22.75K block was sold at the bid price of $0.07.

**Tellurian Investments Inc. (TELL + $0.25 to $6.67):** Option volume is running at over 15x the daily average of 146 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 7.50 call. Volume on this contract is 1,268 (vs. open interest of 4,883) which mostly consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.25.

**iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG + $0.36 to $26.51):** Option volume is running at over 9x the daily average of 975 contracts which is primarily being driven by a 5K block that was bought on the October 18th 26.00 put for $0.43 when the bid/ask spread was $0.40 x $0.45 (open interest is 2,085). We know this block is a new position and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread.

**Farfetch Ltd. (FTCH + $0.25 to $9.21):** A couple of large blocks were seen simultaneously trading out on the January 2020 expiration earlier this morning:

* A 5,000 block was bought on the 10.00 call for $1.40 when the bid/ask spread was $1.30 x $1.45 (open interest is 850)
* A 5,000 block was sold on the 15.00 call for $0.33 (open interest is 67)

We know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a $5.00-wide bull call spread was established for a net debit of $1.07 (X 5,000 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which has the potential to be worth nearly 5x that amount in the event that FTCH closes at or above $15.00 at expiration.

**Gauging Volatility**

The **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 1.92 to 17.74)** has been in the red all day today (intraday range is 17.65-18.83) as equity markets remain higher across the board around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 191, SPX + 25, COMPX + 75). VIX option volume has been tepid today (currently missing from the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.46). The most actively traded contract is the September 18th 22.00 call as volume is 12,661 versus open interest of 110,079.",TodayInTheMahket,1567622388,2,2,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czowxm/options_market_9419/
Calls on $ATVI (Tracer Waifu Edition),"Listen here, $ATVI is blowing the fuck up right now, but is about to have some more bomb ass news after markets close today.  A Nintendo direct is happening at 6:00 pm ET, which will [reportedly be announcing a release of Overwatch for the switch next month](https://kotaku.com/overwatch-comes-to-switch-next-month-1837868458). When Diablo 3 hit the Switch, it sold over 100k units in two days.  Overwatch is a slightly better game than D3, and more importantly it has way better porn than Diablo. Also there are many more switches on the market now than there were a year ago (\~35k switch units sold), so this is gonna bode well for $ATVI.

Long OLLI,"Okay fellow autists, here's the deal: buy Olli calls.

As many of you know, Olli dropped 20 points last week from their quarterly earnings call. 

On the 28th they released their quarterly earnings and surprise surprise same-store sales were down %1, the stock went down from 77 points to 56 over night. However, this was really expected by many considering the rapid growth they've had by taking over the leases of the old toys-r-us buildings (rip) and they've been expanding like crazy on all fronts. Sales growth is actually up 16% nationwide for this quarter and similar bargain stores like DG stock is also going up like crazy. I just don't see how this stock doesn't go back up within a month.

Many people aren't realizing that the same exact type of drop happened back in December of 2018, 86 points dec 4th, down to 71 dec 5th. Thats a 15 point drop.. The stock was back up to 88 in Feb. Which is the exact reason why I'm longing Olli because at the very least they're super undervalued and many analysts agree that this stock will be back up over 75 which a months time.. The 20 point drop was an overreaction to slightly bad news, however, Olli still holds incredible value and I wouldn't be surprised to see them jump back up over 70 within a week or two.

$VITFF An Upcoming Big Gold Junior Play,"Hey guys, ticker Victoria Gold Corp (VITFF) is a junior mining company in Yukon, Canada with a sole project, the Eagle Gold Mine. Eagle Gold Mine is an open pit heap leach mine that has literally just finished construction.

The Eagle Gold Mine is due to pour its first gold bar on September 17th during a livestream at the Denver Gold Forum and it will pour the bar. However, the stock price still has a bunch of construction risk factored in. The gold bar will be poured... their website has videos of the entire mine and their CEO shitposts on twitter. If you want to do your own DD you can, but everything is built and ready to go.

The stock price is currently 0.47 USD giving it a market cap of 500mil CAD. It has 3 billion CAD worth of proven gold ounces and all of their deposits in the area are open at depth. Their 3 billion proven doesn't even include their new deposit they just drilled which can add another billion ounces. They also have a bunch of other deposits that aren't fully drilled... if you don't believe look at their feasibility reports.

They expected 100 mil annual profits with gold price at 1250 USD. With gold at 1550 USD.. their annual profits will be 150mil. If we compare that PE with other gold miners then without even factoring in the exploration upside the company is worth 0.90 to 1.50 USD in the next year.

This junior is highly leveraged to gold price fluctuations... so tendies can be made off of the first gold pour and from rising gold prices.

Only risk is that it has a bit of short term debt. ~60mil. However... it is already ready to produce gold at 1550 price and it has 2 years to make that 60 mil. CEO and management have confirmed that they will be able to pay this off easily and a bunch of big players in the stock (Kinross, Orion, etc.) are in heavy so there is very little risk of further dilution of the stock.

So if you like gold and want to make a play even crazier than an earnings play... VITFF first production play for Sept 17th is the way to go.

Not shilling the stock, I've got 211k shares at an average of 0.30 USD and holding.

"HK update: ""Five demands, not one less""","I went over to r/HongKong to see how actual HKers are reacting to Carrie Lam promising to withdraw the extradition bill. Turns out they are very skeptical. Key points: 

- She hasn't actually withdrawn it; just promised to propose withdrawing it the next time their legislative body reconvenes in October
- She is rejecting the protestors' other demands (universal suffrage, investigation into police brutality, amnesty for protestors, not calling the protests ""riots"")
- People are speculating that China is faking this ""concession"" to make the world less sympathetic toward the protestors. Since they aren't granting amnesty, they can arrest all the movement's leaders for inciting violence, then reintroduce a new version of the bill later on (perhaps disguised/buried in some larger piece of legislation to dampen outrage)
- China state media is giving this news full coverage, meaning they aren't afraid at all of looking weak. This contributes to suspicion that this is merely a chess move in their plot to subdue HK.

Tl;dr don't read too much into Lam's ""concession."" The protests are going to continue. The only question is whether the international community will continue to care. May give markets a short term pop but long term it's doubtful that this conflict is actually resolved.",printingious,1567598048,251,48,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czjt9o/hk_update_five_demands_not_one_less/

Best DD ALL YEAR,,iggy555,1567555526,1,0,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czd3wr/best_dd_all_year/
Free earnings tends: Cloudera ($CLDR) -- DD Inside,"**About the stock:**

Cloudera specializes in creating solutions for companies to manage large amounts of data and apply machine learning models to said data. TL/DR: Software made for retarded business analysts who have no clue wtf data science is or how it works but know how to click buttons on a computer.

**Valuation:**

Since IPO in 2017 (at $18) the stock has ranged between $23 and $5 and is now sitting at a fairly attractive price of $7.20 ($1.97B cap). Growth slowed down and investors fled after a shitty merger with Hortonworks, but they've since been trying to turn the company around. Last quarter they posted revenue of $187M which represented an 81% y/y growth. For the retards in the back, this means they posted close to the revenue of $ROKU last quarter ($250M) at an even better growth rate (81% vs. 59%) for 1/9 the valuation. 

Looking at forward revenue, they guided for $180-183M for this upcoming quarterly earnings; I'm hoping for a solid beat of around $190M. So if we extrapolate a bit, they could see 4-quarter forward revenue (assuming steady growth) of close to $1 billion, which would translate to \~2 P/S -- when compared to other software stocks that's peanuts.

**Catalysts:**

They recently announced a new platform called Cloudera Data Platform (CDP for short) which aims to take their entire business to the cloud and operate solely on subscriptions, as opposed to the in-person custom solutions they provide now. This \*should\* accelerate growth even more and bring in those juicy subscription based revenues that every wall st. analyst gets off to.

**Some other things:**

Carl Icahn, activist investor who bought into $NFLX at $10, recently became involved with the company this summer; he bought up 20% of the shares and installed 2 of his henchmen to the board of Cloudera. This man means business and he won't take losses for an answer, even if it means calling up Trump and having him pump the damn thing on twitter.

**Acquisition:**

In June, Cloudera and IBM announced a ""strategic partnership"". This comes after IBM had a juicy relationship with Hortonworks, the company that Cloudera merged with. IBM would be a top contender for buying out $CLDR at a fat premium -- they just acquired RedHat for like $30 billion so $2-3 billion would be nothing to them. I've read that Icahn has been encouraging a buyout as well, and I'd guess Cloudera would go for at $12-15/share.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final thoughts:**

Options are still pretty cheap -- there's about a 14% implied move but the stock has seen huge 40% moves after earnings. At a $2B valuation, this seems like a no-brainer. Loaded up on 9/20 $7.50 calls today, and earnings are AH on 9/4.

Morning Briefing (9/3/2019),"# Familiar concerns set up market for negative start

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade 25 points, or 0.9%, below fair value after a long Labor Day weekend in which ongoing global events have contributed to familiar growth concerns.

In U.S.-China trade news, the 15% tariff rate on $110 billion of new Chinese imports went into effect on Sunday, as did China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports. In new developments, China said it has filed a WTO complaint over tariffs, and the two sides are struggling to agree on a date in September for trade talks, according to sources from *Bloomberg*. 

To be fair, there is nothing to suggest that tensions have further increased or suggest the two sides won't agree on a date. The news, however, does come amid escalated protests in Hong Kong and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's threat to call a general election for Oct. 14 if parliament forces a three-month Brexit delay.

The latter has contributed to further strength in the U.S. dollar, at the expense of the British pound, which could be a headwind for the earnings prospects of U.S. multinational companies. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.4% to 99.30 -- its highest level since May 2017.

On the data front, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 51.3) and Construction Spending for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 10:00 a.m. ET. Auto and truck sales for August will be released throughout the day.

U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields slightly lower this morning. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.49%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.49%. WTI crude is down 1.8%, or $0.98, to $54.12/bbl. 

In U.S. Corporate news:

* **Boeing** (BA 359.00, -5.09): -1.4% following a *Wall Street Journal* report indicating its 737 Max 8 jets could be grounded until next year. 
* **Apple** (AAPL 206.50, -2.24): -1.1% amid general trade concerns. Apple's AirPods and Apple Watches will no longer be exempt from tariffs. 

Reviewing overnight developments:

* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note, with India's Sensex underperforming amid the release of weak growth data. Japan's Nikkei UNCH, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.4%, China's Shanghai Composite +0.2%, India's Sensex -2.1%, South Korea's Kospi -0.2%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.1%.
   * In economic data:
      * China's August Manufacturing PMI 49.5 (expected 49.7; last 49.7), Non-Manufacturing PMI 53.8 (expected 53.6; last 53.7), and Caixin Manufacturing PMI 50.4 (expected 49.8; last 49.9)

Brexit DD: Where is Soros?,"As none of you ignorant fucks know on the other side of the pond the pound has taken a bad beating. British version of TheDonald (tm) is a bloke called Boris Johnson, who has been skull fucking pound sterling by going around Europe and advocating no deal Brexit. This is essentially equivalent of economic suicide (something this sub is very familiar with). Next week parliament will try to stop this self-inflicted wound and pound sterling will bound back up. I picked up some pound by buying an ETF that is 100% invested in pound. UK banks are also beat up... Let's discuss this.... Some hedge funds made a killing right after the vote.

Why the trade war will be ending very soon,"Alright you autists, here's my retarded DD on why the trade war will be ending soon. 

Both sides are eager to end the trade war. And their latest actions support this hypothesis. 

(1) Orange man has an election to win. He needs time for the economy to grow and recover while campaigning and if the trade war does not end now or very soon, he will not have enough time. In the past, he has always used the stock market to justify his presidency. His resumption of raising tariffs during this time is no coincidence because of this time constraint. His latest actions have proven that he is getting desperate for a quick end to the trade war. His call to ban US companies from doing business with China demonstrates this.  His lies about the Chinese phone call also show that he is anxious about the effect the trade war is having on the stock market which both supports the importance he is placing on the stock market being linked to his political position, and his desperation. 

(2) the trade war threatens the CCP's political position. The CCP believes it derives its mandate to rule from the growing economy. It believes that a stable and growing economy reinforces a stable political environment in China. Therefore, it sees any economic threat as a political threat and the CCP's number one priority is to stay in power. For those of you who did not know, a lot of revolutions and revolts that have toppled and threatened dynasties throughout Chinese history have their beginnings in economic troubles. The reason China has delayed the trade war to the eve of the 2020 elections is to give itself a better bargaining position with Trump as he becomes more desperate. China does not want to wait until after the 2020 elections because if Trump were to win, he would be in a better position for negotiations. If the Democrats were to win, there would be no guarantee that they would easier to negotiate than Trump and it is likely the Democrats would not end the trade war without concessions that Trump was seeking due to similar national security concerns that transcend party lines. Furthermore, the CCP is wary of the economic havoc Trump would exact if the CCP refuses to end the trade war before the elections. Therefore, not ending the trade war before the elections bring considerable risk to the CCP's political position. The latest Hong Kong protests have not helped at all in this regard.

SPY puts play for moderate level autists,"What goes up must come down, right? SPY is forming a triple top on the one month chart, having some real difficulties breaking above 294 as illustrated by a colorful picture here. Failing to break above it again might cause it to plunge below the support @ around 283.

[The arrows don't lie](https://i.redd.it/am5ry1uchtj31.jpg)

Technical dickery aside, the trade wars are not going too well and tariff man has a big mouth. Judging by his tweets tuesday is going to open red so the puts will be a bit pricey compared to friday, but I believe there is a real chance to break the support and then all hell breaks loose. I´d recommend at least one month expiry puts if you want to play a deeper dive. Pussies take profit @283 and if you want to apply damage control (lol) you can sell the puts @295 for a loss.

[DD] Spotify - Just Long This Shit,"I don't know how many of you are aware but for the last few months, Spotify have been successfully degrading the quality of their clients on all platforms massively.

I'm not even going to delve into all of this cause it's been heavily discussed with very sour and vocal posts on /r/spotify just sort by top 1 month/year or whatever. They've nuked the desktop client, made it look like it's designed for kids under 12 with asperger5, while giving you helpful ""suggestions"" on new albums they'd really like you to listen to, because their advertisers told them to. It's basically a complete shithow by now, I don't even think I have the choice to listen to what I want anymore, and they're already showing people forced ads.

The point I'm trying to make is, I realized today I'd rather give up my first born child than for them to take away the convenience of accessing my decade of emotionally expressive playlists. It's a no contest, have been subscribing for so long, I'm not gonna move to some plebian retard service like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Tidal, or whatever the fuck it's called. Spotify knows that I've been sneaking in Evanescense during my Slack and they will just put more of that shit in my Discover Weekly.

Apple Sep 10 event DD,"Three new iPhone models are expected with a rumored ""Pro"" version. They may also provide more details and big announcements on content/shows/pricing of Apple TV+ streaming service. Here is the interesting part - hysterically, day before event shares are flat or  negative 1-2% (compared to launch day stock price)  and flat or slight loss day after (everyone has extreme expectations, this is Apple after all). 

So seems boring, right? Well, at the same time, historically Apple stock price goes up anywhere between 5 and 15% in the next 60-90 days following the event. Looking at the past 5 years, it tends to peak around late November (first point of inflection) or sometime in January (second point of inflection) This is due to two reasons:

1) While products may not look exciting enough to investors, it's a premium item and there is no competition to iPhone that is just like the iPhone (no one else can run iOS or use their app store). People still upgrade older iPhones for new iPhones due to upgrade lust, because they spent too much on Apple Ecosystem (watch, apps, apple TV, Mac, etc), it's a default upgrade for iPhone business users.

2) Events are typically held in September, giving Apple time to stock up inventory for holiday seasons a few months later and report on new sales and revenue. It's an easy default gift, it's often the ""i want NEW iPhone"" from kids that makes parents drop the cash. Don't forget about Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday when other retailers are likely to offer Apple products (not always iPhones) are a bait to get people into their stores (Best Buy, Walmart, Fry's Electronics, Target, etc). 

It is very likely they will be continuing in trying to set themselves apart from the rest of tech companies on security and privacy features, helping with sales to the business sector. This is where security maters as young folks will give up all privacy for a badge on Snap, likes on Facebook or Instagram.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this helps with ER in late October. At this point they have been riding back to school sales of laptops, apps from all those college/school bound students, new phones, ear pods, apple watches and apple TV boxes for Thanksgiving holidays. Hence the peak around early November.

So I see it as an opportunity for two plays:

1) Stock - by and hold 60-90 days, definitely into Christmas sales and maybe Q1 2020 when they would report even more sales.

2) Calls going several months out 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course if they blow the presentation with something that is totally incremental and not excited in any single way, none of this maters.

For the first time since the secondary offering after earnings, IB has 0 shares to lend out (as of yesterday afternoon when I checked), which is a good sign.

Morning Briefing (8/30/2019),"# Market maintains good mood

U.S. equity futures are pointing to a higher start on Wall Street on this last trading day of the month. The S&amp;P 500 enters the session down 1.9% in August but that could be reduced, as the S&amp;P 500 futures trade 19 points, or 0.7%, above fair value.

There's no specific catalyst driving the positive futures trade, but an upbeat mood after yesterday's trade-induced rally has supported some buying momentum heading into the Labor Day weekend. Other positive considerations, although not necessarily market-moving, include solid gains in **Dell** (**DELL** 51.60, +4.83, +10.3%) and **Campbell Soup** (**CPB** 45.50, +2.19, +5.1%) following their earnings reports.

**Ulta Beauty** (**ULTA** 250.00, -87.45, -25.9%) for its part is getting clobbered in pre-market action after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its full-year guidance. 

Today's economic data will consist of the Personal Income (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and Personal Spending (Briefing.com consensus 0.5%) report for July, which will include the PCE Price Index (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%), at 8:30 a.m. ET; the Chicago PMI for August (Briefing.com consensus 48.2) at 9:45 a.m. ET; and the revised University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August (Briefing.com consensus 92.4) at 10:00 a.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the positive bias in the futures trade. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.56. WTI crude is down 1.5%, or $55.87, to $55.88/bbl.

BILI Stock is a value stock with good valuations,"BILI stock despite beating earnings experiences a dip due to forecasted expenses for the coming quarters.  Much of this is due to diversification into other industries - mobile, live broadcasting, online advertising, e-commerce, etc. Revenue will depreciate as a result but makes sense as this company is still in it's investment phases. 

One of the big factor that drives me to be bullish is the user growth. More specifically ACTIVE user growth has increased 30% in the recent quarter, driving the total active user base to 110M members. On paper, these are extremely tell-tale numbers. 80% of active users are mobile based, which will grow as the mobile industry grows along + improved graphics etc. Correlation is a key things. Ran the numbers for BILI along with tech sector/graphics (AMD, NVIDIA, etc), correlation is 0.45-0.56. Those are pretty decent numbers indicating growth in these sectors result in BILI growth to some extent. Standard dev. is 4%! pretty good predictor. 

More on the numbers. Trade war price should be settled in across the board and tariff increases will have little impact on the products of this company. I believe revenue resumes pretty high, actually 450% surprise on Mobile revenue and overall 50% surprise on revenue. 

TDLR: BILI spent a lot of money, will continue to do so for the year, but revenue should grow due to huge increases in Active Users!

2) growth is slowing. YoY growth came in at 16% which for a tech company is not great.

Pros: 

1)  I could see someone come in and either buy them out or take an active position in them. Chamath Palihapitiya was bullish on them at $25 not too long ago and he made it his top pick for AI. Obviously it hasn’t performed as expected so I could see his fund $IPOA taking a position. Or it could be another tech company looking to add to their offerings. 

2) they have a 106% retention rate with 69% of them being Fortune 500 companies. It has all these add on products that compliment their core offering. Growth among existing customers was only 10%.

Morning Briefing (8/29/2019),"# Futures market excited by calm remarks

U.S. equity futures have jumped on conciliatory trade remarks from China, although Beijing stopped short of confirming if it will hold off on retaliatory tariffs. The S&amp;P 500 futures are up 28 points and trade 1.0% above fair value. 

China's Ministry of Commerce spokesman, Gao Feng, indicated the U.S. should withdraw plans for new tariffs and said both sides should create conditions for progress in trade negotiations. According to *Reuters*, Mr. Gao did not answer directly if his remarks suggested that Beijing would not retaliate against the latest tariff threat from the U.S. 

Evidently, the futures market is liking China's softer stance today while the two sides continue to discuss a timetable for September trade talks.

Earnings reports since yesterday's close have featured more retail results. **Dollar Tree** (**DLTR** 106.00, +6.40, +6.4%) and **Dollar General** (**DG** 150.20, +9.17, +6.5%) are up following their results, while **Best Buy** (**BBY** 64.90, -4.10, -5.9%) drops on mixed results and guidance. 

On the data front, investors will receive the second estimate for Q2 GDP (Briefing.com consensus 2.0%); the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report; and the advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories for July at 8:30 a.m. ET. Pending Home Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) will be released at 10:00 a.m. ET. 

U.S. Treasuries have edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.52%, and the 10-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.49%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.28. WTI crude is up 0.7%, or $0.37, to $56.15/bbl.

Equity Returns Across Recessions,"This is a summary of an excerpt of some firm-wide DD sent out last week from Morgan Stanley. Thought this would be useful for you guys but let me know if this is too abstract. Can post excerpts from research daily if there is interest. 

The worst performance for most industry groups has tended to come in the \~3 month period after the start of the recession, with significant widening in returns thereafter. 

* Persistent Outperformance: Health Care &amp; Staples
   * Food/Beverage/Tobacco, Health Care Equipment + Services, Pharma/Biotech/LS tend to perform on an absolute and relative basis. Household/PP/Software/Utilities show relative outperformance with a significantly greater variance. 
* Persistent Underperformance: Autos &amp; Tech Hardware 
   * Strong tendency to continue weakening through recessions. Capital Goods, Materials, M/E, &amp; Telco show the same trend but to a less extent. 
* Rebound: Consumer Discretionary
   * CD/Apparel, CS, and Retailing have a tendency to show solid rebounds in relative performance starting a few months after recessions begin. CS and Transportation show similar patterns, but have generally stronger performance through the entire recession. 
* Sizes &amp; Styles: Avoid Junk and Lean Defensive
   * Junk displays consistently poor performance after the start of a recession (mods r gay and even they would know this). Defensives tend to outperform cyclicals, but Telecom and Utilities (which traditionally are defensive) did not display as strong a tendency to outperform.",xxyoungmoneyxx69,1567036948,52,46,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cwt2zl/equity_returns_across_recessions/

The U.S. Treasury market remains a focal point after yesterday saw more flattening and/or inversions within the curve. Low yields are usually a positive consideration for risk assets, but there comes a point when investors begin to fear they are a harbinger for weaker economic and corporate earnings growth. 

Currently, the 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.51%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.46%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.13. WTI crude is up 1.5% to $55.73/bbl following some bullish inventory data. Official government data will be released at 10:30 a.m. ET. 

Elsewhere, UK Prime Minister Johnson has stirred some attention after he said he would request a suspension of Parliament until mid-October. This move would likely make it harder to block a no-deal Brexit by Oct. 31. The British pound has fallen against the dollar, while UK's FTSE (unch) sees relative strength against its peers. 

Separately, the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 6.2% following a 0.9% decline in the prior week.

My 18 year old brother in law said he and all his friends have been trying to get their hands on one all week. To my surprise the sandwich is actually delicious AF. 10/10 would recommend.

Afternoon Briefing (8/27/2019),"# Midday Summary: Stocks down near session lows as Treasury yields continue to decline

The stock market trades down near session lows after it began the session in a broad-based advance. The early gains have faltered alongside a noticeable decline in U.S. Treasury yields, leaving the S&amp;P 500 (-0.4%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.5%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%) down around 0.5%. The Russell 2000 is down 1.2%. 

There wasn't any specific news driver for today's higher start, but some follow-through buying, or end-of-the-month repositioning, may have contributed to the positive bias. Some pointed to trade-related hope, but there was little to suggest the market would continue to rally on trade while China continued to deny yesterday's presumed news catalyst.

Strikingly, safe-haven assets like gold ($1552.40, +15.20, +1.0%) and U.S. Treasuries held firm leading up to the higher start and have since seen increased demand amid the retreat in equities. The move in the Treasury market has had a noticeable effect on the S&amp;P 500 financials sector (-1.0%) as the yield curve continues to see flattening/inversion activity.

Specifically, the 2s10s spread inversion has widened to four basis points, largely due to a seven-basis-point drop in the 10-yr yield (1.48%). The 3mo-10yr spread, which researchers at the San Francisco Federal Reserve found to be the most reliable of the different term spreads as a recession indicator, is inverted by 51 basis points. That spread has been inverted since May.

Among the lone bright spots in the market include the defensive-oriented real estate (+0.2%) and utilities (+0.4%) sectors, which also tend to benefit from lower yields. 

Dow component **Johnson &amp; Johnson** (**JNJ** 130.52, +2.72, +2.1%) also trades higher, although the reason for its outperformance isn't something to gloat about. JNJ was found liable in an Oklahoma court for its part in the opioid crisis and is being ordered to pay $572 million, which was at the low end of expectations and much less than the $17 billion the state wanted.

In M&amp;A news, tobacco companies **Philip Morris International** (**PM** 72.43, -5.28, -6.7%) and **Altria Group** (**MO** 45.85, -1.27, -2.3%) have been in talks to merge. MO initially jumped about 10% on news that it would be an all-stock merger of equals, but shares have turned negative on reports that a merger might give Altria Group just 41% of the company with no premium.

Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for August, the FHFA Housing Price Index for June, and the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for June:

* The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for August printed at 135.1 (Briefing.com consensus 129.6) versus an upwardly revised 135.8 (from 135.7) in July, which was the third highest reading since October 2000.
   * The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a pretty solid state of consumer confidence, which is a supportive foundation for continued discretionary spending. That matters greatly for an economy driven predominantly by consumer spending.
* The FHFA Housing Price Index for June increased 0.2% following a revised 0.2% increase in May (from 0.1%).
* The S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for June increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus of 2.7%) following a 2.4% increase in May.",Teenoh,1566925795,3,5,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cw7dus/afternoon_briefing_8272019/

**Today’s Bullish Activity**

Shares of Dow-component **Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. (JNJ + $2.30 to $130.10)** are gapping up following news that an Oklahoma judge ruled that the healthcare giant must pay $572M for its part in fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic. The stock is moving higher as the fine was significantly lower than the $17B the Oklahoma Attorney General had been seeking to help pay for addiction treatment and prevention programs. Evercore ISI said fine expectations were between $500M and $5B with the consensus estimate around $1B. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the September 20th 130.00 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 6,774).

Also trading to the upside is **Caleres Inc. (CAL + $3.84 to $19.08)** after the footwear maker reported Q2 earnings of $0.62 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.04 beat) on revenue that increased 6.5% year-over-year to $752.5M (roughly in-line with the $752.2M consensus estimate). Brand portfolio sales increased 17.9% year-over-year to $359.6M while total Famous Footwear sales were $419.8M on same-store sales that increased 1.5%. Call volume is dominating (\~7:1 over puts) which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 15.00 call (volume is 3,115).

Lastly, **Altria Group Inc. (MO + $3.99 to $51.11)** is moving higher on news that the company is in discussions with **Phillip Morris International Inc. (PM - $4.44 to $73.29)**regarding a potential all-stock merger of equals. MO calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:3 with the September 20th 50.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 9,090). PM puts are outnumbering calls better than 2:1 with the September 20th 75.00 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 3,983). PM average implied volatility is up to a year-to-date high of 36% this morning. *Note: the average implied volatility represents an estimated value for a 30-day implied volatility at the current underlying price, based on a curve fit of option implied volatilities.* 

New 52-week highs (39 new highs today): **Agree Realty Corp. (ADC + $0.55 to $73.85),** **Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM + $0.44 to $62.60), Idacorp Corp. (IDA + $0.70 to $109.71), Roku Inc. (ROKU + $2.59 to $145.60)**

**Notable Call Activity**

Some unusual call activity (\~50:1 over puts) is coming up on the radar on **Cloudera Inc. (CLDR + $0.02 to $8.85)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 7.50 call. Volume on this contract is 9,966 (vs. open interest of 13,376) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for between $0.48 and $0.50 each.

**Yelp Inc. (YELP + $0.65 to $32.68):** Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 20:1 as option traders primarily target two contracts that expire at the end of this week (August 30th):

* 33.00 call (volume is 7,885 vs. open interest of 125): Transactions on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for $0.56.
* 32.50 call (volume is 3,588 vs. open interest of 56): Transactions on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for between $0.71-0.86.

We know that the volume on both of these contracts represents new positioning based on the open interest figures and the bulk of the activity appears to be bullish in nature.

**Today’s Bearish Activity** 

Moving lower this morning is **J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM - $10.17 to $102.76)** after the branded pet, consumer foods and coffee company reported fiscal Q1 earnings of $1.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.18 miss) on revenue that fell 6.5% year-over-year to $1.78B (below the $1.88B expected). Commenting on the quarter, CEO Mark Smucker stated, “Our first quarter performance fell short of expectations primarily due to the timing of shipments and deflationary pricing in the coffee and peanut butter categories, as well as competitive activity in the premium dog food category”. Additionally, the company lowered full-year 2020 EPS guidance to $8.35-8.55 (from $8.45-8.65) on revenue that is expected to be “down 1% to flat” (from a prior view of “up more than 2%”). Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the September 20th 100.00 put topping the most actives list (volume is 1,307). 

Also trading to the downside is **Anaplan Inc. (PLAN - $2.86 to $56.49)** even though the maker of cloud-based planning software beat quarterly estimates and provided upbeat guidance earlier this morning. Anaplan reported a Q2 loss of $0.12 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.04 beat) on revenue that increased 46.2% year-over-year to $84.5M (above the $78.25M). Looking ahead, the company guided Q3 revenue to a range of $85.5-86.5M (vs. the $83.49M consensus estimate) and raised full-year 2020 revenue guidance to a range of $339-343M (from $326-331M). Calls are outnumbering puts better than 2:1 with the September 20th 60.00 call garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 1,289).

New 52-week lows (274 new lows today): **American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL - $0.16 to $25.03), Credicorp Ltd. (BAP + $1.44 to $202.22), Footlocker Inc. (FL - $0.34 to $35.35), Halliburton Co. (HAL + $0.18 to $17.68), Macy’s Inc. (M - $0.05 to $14.66)**

**Notable Put Activity**

Some unusual put activity (nearly 4:1 over calls) is being seen in **Hewlett Packard Enterprises Inc. (HPE + $0.04 to $12.98)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the August 30th 12.50 put. Volume on this contract is 15,566 (vs. open interest of 1,151), which nearly entirely consisted of a 15K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.18. We know this block is a new position based on the open interest figure and we can assume that the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

**Volume Signals** 

Shares of the **iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV + $0.42 to $16.94)** are pushing up to a nearly a two-year high this morning and six out of the top ten most actively traded option contracts across the market today are coming from this ETF. The top two most actively traded option contracts across the board today are the SLV October 18th 17.00 call (volume is 62,171 vs. open interest of 83,674) and the SLV January 2020 16.00 call (volume is 49,211 vs. open interest of 123,876).

**Chubb Ltd. (CB + $0.35 to $155.56):** Option volume is running at over 20x the daily average of 144 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of blocks that simultaneously traded on the September 20th expiration:

* 150.00 put – a 1,000 block traded for $1.40, directly in the middle of the $1.35 x $1.45 bid/ask spread (open interest of 210)
* 140.00 put – a 1,000 block was sold for $0.35 (open interest of 49)

We know these blocks are new positions and it appears that a $10.00-wide bear put spread was established for a net debit of $1.05 which suggests that the block trader believes that CB will close below the break-even price of $148.95 at expiration.

**Planet Fitness Inc. (PLNT + $1.12 to $69.49):** Option volume is running at over 5.5x the daily average of 904 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 70.00 call. Volume on this contract is 3,160 (vs. open interest of 1,858) which mostly consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought for between $1.85-2.00, including a 1,064 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.85. Shares of PLNT have been in a downtrend for most of August but are exhibiting some relative strength today and appear to have found some technical support at the 200-day SMA over the past week.

**Gauging Volatility**

The **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 0.44 to 19.76)** has been on both sides of the unchanged line this morning (intraday range is 18.49-20.35) as equity markets are mixed around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 7, SPX + 2, COMPX - 3). VIX option volume has been below average today at 209,991 contracts (#5 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.44). The most actively traded contract is the September 18th 21.00 call as volume is 40,615 versus open interest of 154,710.",TodayInTheMahket,1566925228,27,7,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cw7995/options_market_82719/

Oil prices are a structural component of ever country’s price level, starting with transportation costs. Petro derived chemicals and fuels are also used in the manufacturing of semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, forged metals, plastics, rubber, lubricants, asphalt, and more.

Gold and The Dollar: Kill Bill Vol. 3,"*First off, when I write DD read the whole fucking thing in order, including links. I use a very creative process for your enjoyment and organize in such a way that tries to give you the highest level of understanding possible, but if you read for a tldr...you are pleb. Now, would you kindly sit down, and take your time. If you dont have this* [level of dedication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2dehpRFyLA)*, leave now.*

&amp;#x200B;

* **A partnership gone betrayed between** [Gold](https://imgur.com/a/iJ6U4lv) **vs (Dollar)** [Bills](https://imgur.com/a/nSI1mlw)

 As the puzzle pieces come into the narrative for gold, I am seeing a story very similar to Kill Bill. Its beautiful, follow me.

In 1971, Nixon took us off the gold standard ""temporarily"", [but the plan was to always to burry Gold.](https://youtu.be/Ris0Kce0ZPo?t=148)

I mean is this so hard to believe? Why doesn't the fact NIXON, a man who was crazy paranoid simply not tell you everything you need to know? The man was a certified CROOK.

An excerpt from [Nixon Shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock): ""By 1973, the Bretton Woods system was replaced *de facto* by the current regime based on freely floating fiat currencies."" (Sound familiar today?)

Can we honestly say this was a wise man? Do you think he cared about the unintended consequences? I would say no because he fought a stupid war, did illegal operations with politics, and in the end abandoned his post as president. In my eyes, this man is no different than Bernie Madoff, ***A Wizard of*** [***Lies***](https://imgur.com/a/t4ZMGoZ)***.***

My friend, the US dollar died in 1971, and ever since then you have used the Nixon Dollar. His curse is still here.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Gold: no matter what you do to constrain it, you will fail.**

There's a scene from Kill Bill, that perfectly visualizes the relentless nature of Gold Climbing back for [Revenge](https://youtu.be/Mk5fAvpwtKU?t=17). YOU CAN NOT STOP THIS. WE WILL CLAP THOSE CHEEKS. Gold has [Relentless Confidence](https://youtu.be/zCqN-xNjS-0?t=140), it's confidence level is literally God-Like.

""Well why is it taking so long?"" Gold does two things, it allows fiat to melt itself away, and chooses the right time to blitzkrieg fiat at the weakest. Gold doesn't care how many fiat goons you send in, [Its futile.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8trTO5mJYsg) 

Gold has a [List of Fiat Currencies](https://youtu.be/VnoT6_LNUjA?t=8) that it has to go through, so it does take a little while. Look at the 10 year chart on this [Website.](https://www.kitco.com/gold_currency/index.html?currency=sek&amp;timePeriod=10y&amp;flag=gold&amp;otherChart=no) Fiats have been getting slaughtered. Fact.

&amp;#x200B;

When Gold reaches that last one, the Dollar Bill, It will be way more swift than people realize because other countries have already seen their currencies melt, and foreigners will actually understand first that the USD is on the same course because it has happened to them first! Foreigners are simply [Psychologically Primed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLeji6EidI8) already with this fear. That is why I think when the snap happens it will be a death blow like this, [ The Five Finger Death Punch.](https://youtu.be/VbDbOdKL9ZY?t=22)

My take on the market right now #bullgangriseup,"Got some solid DD with some solid MS Paint

So we can see here that last year before we had that big drop we had a triple bottom with a 263 resistance every time in each of those periods it was a trump tweet bring it down then up,down then up etc..

then we had a massive selloff due to a mix of shit. Same thing is happening now On December 3rd trump did his crybaby rant this was the last peak we have there. right now we are testing a 282 resistance and it has shot back up due to trump tweets each time, From this Im assuming in the next week we will hit 293$ one more time and then all hell will brake loose probably will test 250$ this will happen mid September and we will have steady growth until April of next year reaching 330/340 and we will repeat this one more time until election hits causing us to hit 380$ by election day and trump will get re elected. 

Also the day before we had the major crash we had alot of trump investigations/accusations going on hence what is happening now. Id say grab up some puts and ride this down then ride this bitch to the moon.

TL:DR trump tweet equals go down a lot then we go up steady hit ATH and then repeat one more time, for election were he will be guaranteed a reelection

How To Loan: The WSB Guide,"**Step 1:** Find a P2P lending service (Upstart/Prosper)

**Step 2:** Apply for a loan with the reason for the loan being ***student loan ( MOST IMPORTANT IF ITS NOT A STUDENT LOAN DO NO TAKE IT OUT)***

**Step 3:** Interest rate doesn’t matter but origination fee does. I know Upstart shows different interest/origination for different time frames/loans. Fuck with it a little get that origination fee ***LOW***.

**Step 4:** Get approved. 

***Intermission:*** Once you are approved you will have to wait for the loan to hit your credit report/ receive funds. For me this happened within a week. Feel free to purchase FD's while you wait.

**Step 5:** Go to SoFi.com (or any other student loan subsidization company)

**Step 6:** Apply for a student loan refinancing. Make sure you select your most recent P2P lender as the party being credited. You will need your Upstart ID/Loan details when you select it from the menu. 

**Step 7:** Choose your interest rate/payments. SoFi lets you subsidize your student loans in different ways. For example you can get a lower monthly payment but have a higher overall interest or higher monthly payments and lower interest.

**Profit:** Since SoFi is assisted as a government subsidy for student loans, they are not allowed to charge huge interest rates like Upstart for student loans. I personally took out a loan from Upstart for 22% and was able to refinance the loan right after the first payment hit my account. Now I’m borrowing 20k for 10 years at 6.5% with monthly payments of $180 vs $554.

Disney,"Disney is releasing their shows on Disney+ on a weekly basis rather than on a ‘binge’ basis that other platforms like Netflix use. 

This is a big move as I can recount countless encounters where people simply purchase a month of Netflix watch the show they want and then end their subscription. Having episodes release on a weekly basis will force people to hold on to their subscription to watch the shows rather than binge it all at once and then cancel.

NETFLIX PUTS = THE BIG SHORT,"Look. This month has been helluva up and down cuck fest with Mango Man's Trade Wars and the Fed meetings. We've all been scrambling to find new tendies every week and I realized that the best opportunity for a Big Short for EVERYONE would be to go YOLO on Netflix Puts.

Since July 17th, Netflix has plummeted from $360 to $290. Their last Earnings revealed they had beaten EPS, but fell just short of Revenue expectations and Subscription numbers were only 50% of what they expected. With the current market conditions and the looming competition from Disney and Apple ahead, I doubt we'll ever see Netflix at $300 per share.

Sell SPY puts.,"There is no trade war. The DOJ puts out some pansy statement saying Trump's tweets are official presidential statements. But, in fact, they're just opinions.   
Does anyone have a shred of proof that any tariffs have been imposed?  
The tweets are just statements. They themselves do not enact the tariffs.

"Trump's next target, $TGT","I have some ATM $TGT puts right now, but I'm going to hold because I think it could go lower.

So far this is just the tip of the iceberg of my research. I plan to investigate how much the 5% increase on tariffs (Trump just announced via twitter) will impact the company over this weekend, i.e. how many of Target's high margin products are made there.

As if to hide the word China from it's most recent report, TGT's 10Q only referred readers to the February 2, 10K.  

&gt;""The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report.""

If you go back to that report, that section says:

&gt;""A large portion of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the U.S., with China as our *single largest source*, so any major changes in tax or trade policy, such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, could require us to take certain actions, such as raising prices on products we sell, which could adversely affect our results of operations.""

Profiting off some Aussie's family problems,"I have a really simple investment thesis supporting a long position in HP Inc.  In 2015, the well-established computer software and printing giant spun off its its cloud services business from the rest of its traditional model.  Investors initially assessed the growth potential for the spin-off to be higher than the parent.  They were wrong:  under the leadership of the Australian CEO Dion Weisler, HP Inc. experienced a period of essentially nonstop growth until late 2018.  

The past year has been a different story.  Particularly, this week, HP Inc. weathered a tough 6% loss to its stock price.  Turns out our man Dion had to step down from his CEO spot to deal with some family problems.  Investors who're selling right now are presumably reacting to this development.  

Having done a bit more research, I found this a bit weird.  Yeah, Dion did a good job for HP post spin-off, but earnings this year have been mostly flat.  Why the sudden indication of support for a CEO who recently lost his touch?  If anything, I would have expected the stock to improve marginally at the news.  

They guy set to replace him is far from incompetent.  He currently runs the printing section of HP's business.  I like this for one big reason:  printing is a struggling department in HP's revenue.  That sucks for HP, because printing's profit margin is so good.  The software department is up a couple percent this year, but the printing dip balanced that growth out and lead to another flat earnings report.  This new guy could offer an added level of expertise to spark growth in highly lucrative printing.

As of now, it seems that this drop is more of a public panic than a legit response to a worsening market position or anything.  HP, in my opinion, is probably still worth what it was before Dion announced his departure.  It's not like HP is predicting a drop in revenue for next quarter.  All things considered, I expect HP Inc. to recover that 6% in the next three or four months.

Let me know what you guys think.",boison024,1566593918,8,14,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cujtwp/profiting_off_some_aussies_family_problems/

EU is mega mad that they are destroying our largest global forest which is gonna fuck us harder in the long run with climate change and what not. EU is threatening to cancel the trade deals they have with brazil if bolsnaro doesnt do something, and it wouldnt surprise me if they took greater measures.

they are meeting at G7 summit to discuss this. brazil is not invited. seems like a good short oppurtunity if there are any brazil ETFs. its a ballsy play but... g7 summit is this weekend

$TGT and $WMT Pump and Dump,"Immediately after earning reports released, $TGT and $WMT shares surged in price, with Target going over 20%. Why? Banks and investors are pumping the shit out of the stock getting ready for a big dump in the upcoming months. Everyone including their moms freaked out about the 10% tariffs on September 1st on $300billion worth of Chinese imports, with Tim Apple having a personal meeting with Mango Man. As a result, mango man delayed tariffs until December 15th and the market became bullish. 

With that said, retailers like WMT, TGT, DLTR, and DG all stock goods from Chinese factories. During Targets earnings report, there were no questions about Chinese tariffs in the upcoming future so investors could pump the stock. However, companies like DKS (Dicks) were railed with questions about impending tariffs. 

Currently, the trading volume for all 4 stocks are significantly lower than previous volumes. My guess is that investors are waiting for Trump's tweet to put into effect September 1st tariffs in retaliation to China's $75 Billion worth of tariffs that was announced in the morning. Also, there are always corrections after earnings reports and $TGT's $104 share is not priced in. 

Looking at the list from the USTR, there are a FUCK TON of goods like clothing, meats, baby products and raw materials like cotton and plastics that are impending a 10% tariff.

I bought puts for $TGT specifically because the 20% growth won't last long. So buckle up and lets wait for MANGO MAN to tweet his next line of bullshit to tank the market for the second time today!

Short Canadian bond market in around 15 years,"This stems from a few sources: CIBC and RBC investor relations, Sienna, Extendicare, and Rivera investor relations, a few books, and anecdotal experience.

Canada is in a problem.

Senior and assisted living residences are not only unattainably expensive for anyone but FD Champs, but there are almost decade long waitlists. In around 15 years, a huge portion of the population will be seniors. These seniors will deplete the government pension plans (oas and cpp) which already pay out mediocrelly. This will make senior living even less of a possibility.

Seniors thamelves don't work and don't pay tax, or really do anything useful at all to society. When they're old and too poor for AL, their kids will have to take time out of being a productive citizen to help change their shit napkins and ensure they pop their morning xans. The children will be spending more money and time for this, depleting their own savings and deterring their time away from a job which would oblige them to pay tax on.

On top of this, people are having less kids so the population of working individuals will decrease still. The gov pension plans will deplete and will be hardly re-upped. Not to mention gen z is a colassal fuck up. 

Moving on to banking, sketchy debt and huge mortgages to fund the insanely expensive urban houses are on the rise. Canadians also have very low savings relative to their incomes.

Canada's gdp is diverse but Trudeau cares more about the pride parades than making meaningful progress with Mango. Seriously when was the last time Justin was on the news. I nearly forgot who was PM.

GPS(Gap) ER Calls,"Summary: GPS expected EPS is 0.52 a full 30% less than last year's quarter. Although I think that they will go down from last year's quarter, 30% is extremely harsh and I expect an EPS of about 0.60-0.65.  


1.Their online stores are up. Old Navy and Athleta both experience an increase in search results over this last quarter compared to last years quarter. Only Gap itself is down(-8% in search trends), but Old Navy(+1.2%), which constitutes a majority of their sales, and Athleta(+2.6%) are up.   


2. Discount retailers like WMT and TGT have beat their earnings significantly. If other companies in the industry are any indicator of how companies do, then GPS will also beat earnings. Discount retailers are doing great right now and I would expect GPS to not do terribly.  


3. Their aversion to China. In their Q1 guidance they stated that they will be moving their supply chain out of China. I think that they will most likely continue doing that(why wouldn't they) and will have strong guidance for this quarter as they won't be affected by tariffs(something that would seriously harm their already slim profit margins).  


4. Gap would do well in a recession because they are a discount retailer. They were hit pretty bad during the last one, but if an upcoming recession were to happen, they would do better in it because they have significantly shifted further to discount clothing and consumer confidence is higher than last time. People still need clothes when they're poor and when they're poor they buy cheap clothes like perhaps from old navy.  


Basically, their physical retail sector would have needed to crash like 40% for the surprise to be near 0. This is pretty unlikely and I think that they'll beat the expectations by like 0.10-0.15.

Guys this is a bit scary. There was no documents I had to send or proof of income. I can already foresee kids kissing a $7,000 limit, buying Visa gift cards, then using those to buy illicit things. 

Apple Card just gave millions of poor and middle class a lot more spending power than they have. 

Prediction: kids are gonna go into debt solely because of the ease of signing up for this card.

Classic WoW: The Numbers ATVI 50$ Incoming!,"I realized I haven't written about the financials of Classic Wow yet so here's some more fresh DD before the release.

**50$ 8/30 calls jumped 30 cents yesterday from .39 to .69 and this morning spiked up to .90...**

WoW peaked at 12 million subscriptions I've put together a little chart to show you the potential revenues from classic.

[This, of course, is only Classic wow...](https://i.redd.it/3w76l994dth31.png)

The next thing to consider is how many of those players that re-sub to Classic turn around and move into Retail WoW? If we assume only 10% do with BFA selling at 63$ that's the same money as almost another 4 months of subscriptions, the money from subscription-based games is god tier.

There is content in the game that requires players to play together in a 40 man group consistently on a weekly basis clearing bosses to farm for 1% drops it's incomprehensible the amount of time and grinding Classical WoW has in it these people will be ENTHRALLED.

 [https://i.redd.it/go9opn4fkmh31.png](https://i.redd.it/go9opn4fkmh31.png) 

 [https://i.redd.it/h30ou6w47sg31.png](https://i.redd.it/h30ou6w47sg31.png) 

Right now when I log in to Classic Wow there are 6 servers registering as FULL let alone all the high population and mediums aaaand, **this is just in NA the Europeans are even more crazy about games think about all the Competitive E-sports teams from the Scandanavian regions those guys go HARD af and their WoW players are just the same competing for world firsts with everyone else.**

A full server back then would have around 10k+ players on it blizzard has already stated servers will hold more players than before because of the layering system they've built which allows multiple people to play in the same areas without causing disruption to gameplay because of competition over quest spawns etc. 

**So just in players that have logged in to secure their name the numbers are already over 100k.**

There are people who've taken weeks off of work to dedicate to playing, they're flying around the world to meet with old guildmates and planning on binging on take out and neglecting sleep. We're talking practically the most addicting game ever released, just think about that 12 million sub peak. That was 12 million people paying 14.99$ a month JUST TO PLAY A GAME. This shit is not a joke, the video games industry is already overtaking the entertainment industry don't underestimate these companies.

They may draw scandals but take it from me a player that's lived through many game company scandals, it didn't stop me from buying and it didn't stop me from playing. We're all addicted to this shit and it's a low maintenance cash cow.

***This isn't even taking into consideration CoD Mobile numbers and Diablo Immortal Numbers, I'll be doing a major post on those two games probably early September as when Classic drops I'll be streaming it for 2 weeks straight myself.***

Atvi options play 08/23,"So I'm thinking of doing an options play possibly with the  47-48$ calls nice they have a nice Delta and if the stock flat lines or only goes 1% then you'll still make money.

My reasoning is that it did close positive on a mostly red day. 

Rsi is not in the overbought territory and the stock did stay above it's 200 day ema again on a red day. 

For contrast spy was below it's 200 ema for most of the day. 

Also world of Warcraft is out with legacy server and if it's anything like osrs it'll be very successful. 

Looking at candles the lowest atvi can go would be 44.88 and the the past 51.34 it'll probably keep climbing or bounce back

DD for best buy earnings,"Bullish: BBY stopped working there but this is all public information. So SEC don’t come at me. Best Buy has seen a lot of foot traffic as of recently on accessories and credit cards and total tech support and protection plans. All of which are how they make major amounts of money. They do not make really any money on major hardware and appliances. They sell a lot of hardware with accessories attached which is also were they make money. I have 6 call contracts expiring August 30th when earnings are the 29th pre-market. Also best buy has had a recent drop of about 7$ for no real reason beside the entire market dropping that much. And under new management they have improved some business models. I’m expecting atleast a 1-2% gain in the next week or so and a 4-5% gain on earnings bring its share price to about a 70.5$ price on earnings day with a run up same day around 1% bring it to 71.2$ per share. They are the only retailer that can actually out do amazon because with big ticket items people want to see a tv first before they buy it.

"Confusing names, a spin-off, big leverage, little downside, all in a stock everyone hates.","I just took on a long position on a pharmaceutical company, Mallinckrodt (MNK), that appears to be right around its rock bottom.  I think this complex generics manufacturer could make at least a partial recovery toward its 2015 heights and has very limited downside.  Hoping to get feedback from some other retards.  

I initially found MNK while searching for corporations set to spin off part of their operations in the next few months.  The nomenclature surrounding the separation is a bit confusing:  the company being spun-off will retain the Mallinckrodt name, and the parent company will change its name to Sonorant Therapeutics.  Every MNK shareholder will effectively receive one share of the new MNK and one share of Sonorant, the parent, in exchange for one old MNK share.  They're hoping the transaction will be finished before the end of 2019.

I read a couple breakdowns and as much of the Form 10 as I could, and here are the basics:  the new Mallinckrodt will take over control of the specialty generics business, which accounts for around a quarter of the current MNK drug sales. Sonorant will retain everything else.  

They're spinning off for two reasons.  Their opioid generics have come under some expensive law suit heat recently, and it looks like MNK is set to pay big for it.  Since generics is no longer part of their company, Sonorant can shed legal responsibility for the suits.  Sonorant won't take the legal hit and can continue operating normally.  (It's important to note that MNK earnings is right around an all-time low.  They don't realistically have the money to deal with law suits). Hopefully, a combination of more focus being poured into the good parts of the old MNK business and freedom from the law suits will cause Sonorant to become more profitable, and appreciate in value.

Here's where it gets interesting.  Right now, it looks like Sonorant is dumping all their problems onto the new Mallinckrodt with no regard for its long term life.  But MNK's current executive team will largely be in charge of the new Mallinckrodt, not Sonorant.  Only the new CEO's compensation plan is available right now--I'm happy that he's getting paid mostly with stock and options--and I'm hoping the rest of the execs will be paid similarly.  It's in their best interest to see MNK succeed.  

The new Mallinckrodt will also take on a lot of debt to get off the ground when it spins off.  The stock will be super leveraged.  In this scenario, the execs, who are likely to choose stock in the new Mallinckrodt as their form of compensation, stand to make a fortune with the new Mallinckrodt.  

Even though my thesis for the new Mallinckrodt is basically to put all faith in these execs, the downside is not terrible.  Sonorant, free from the suits, is extremely unlikely to \*decrease\* in value due to the spin off.  And the new Mallinckrodt is only a quarter of the whole business, so your losses on the new Mallinckrodt are limited to 25% of your original investment even if the new stock goes all the way to zero.  Yeah, -25% isn't ideal, but I've seen worse in the past 5 minutes on the sub's front page.  

Did I mention that everyone hates MNK stock right now?  P/E ratio is like two and a half, when the average P/E for Pharma companies of MNK's size is close to double digits.  What analysts I have seen bother to take a look at MNK on the internet rate it 'overpriced' and 'sell.'

In my opinion, buy before the spin off for the best value.  I bought around a thousand shares yesterday for 4.50 a share.  Let's see where this goes.

TL;DR MNK is using a spin off to get rid of toxic business.  But all the important people in MNK want to be in the toxic part.  Parent stands to appreciate, spin-off stands to appreciate exponentially.",boison024,1566312086,8,22,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cszygy/confusing_names_a_spinoff_big_leverage_little/

Primer Summary: On January 1, 2020,  Convention on Marine Pollution (MARPOL), Annex VI, will take effect, requiring all marine vessels use fuel with sulfur content below 0.5%. Current standards only see vessels using Low Sulfur Marine Oil when within 200 n. miles of US and EU territories; however, the new convention sets standards on international marine vessels that will essentially prevent the use of Heavy Fuel Oil.  


Heavy Fuel Oil (IFO 380) has a bunker price of \~$300 compared to a LSO (LSMGO) bunker price of about \~$500 &lt; [https://shipandbunker.com/prices](https://shipandbunker.com/prices) \&gt;

According to McKinsey:  
"""" We estimate that the switch to marine gasoil will add about 1.5 million barrels per day to distillate demand globally, leading refiners to run an additional 2.2 million barrels per day of crude oil through distillation. This should increase refining utilization in the major hub markets by 2.9 to 6.7 percentage points. Margins will rise as a result, with European Brent cracking margins expected to be up $3 per barrel. """"

SHORT $EA !!! EA's Apex Legend's devteam and community is at war,"Just a foreword that I'm not executing this play myself. I've stopped ""investing"" for a while now, but I see a potential trade here given how bad the situation seems being on the inside. I'm doing this out of pure boredom.

Just look at the thread above.

&amp;#x200B;

Apex Legends is basically EA's shot at becoming the next Fortnite and it doesn't seem to be going too well. What happened a week ago is Apex's first event which was a total debacle. They added a bunch of new skins, but all of them are considered grossly overpriced by the community (see comments on thread).

&amp;#x200B;

The Dev eventually called their gaming community ""Asshats"" and ""Freeloaders"" (See below)

I'm too lazy to describe the rest of the situation. The community is outraged though and people (me included) have uninstalled (I uninstalled just out of disinterest; can't seem for others).

\--------------------

I don't know what portion Apex Legends is of EA's portfolio (you'll have to figure that out). 

Holding everything else constant (assume that nothing else is going on with EA to move its price at the moment, market doesn't rally, competitor gaming company earnings call beat, etc.), I see this as a reason to short the stock.

My Roku options play for tomorrow,"* After learning that Donald Trump will lift some tariffs to prevent pressure on us companies for the holiday season I am expecting a slight recovery in the market (noted by the indexes) into the end of 2019 because the central theme of these sell offs has been due to the tariffs, which means that the market may have more bullish upside than downside temporarily.  Income revenue from this company (ROKU) is out performing many analyst forecast but I will not get into the details of much fundamentals as this will be a short term play focus on technicals, price action and momentum.   

This stock has been previously selling off every morning of the open from the previous week as noted by the yellow circles I drew.  Doing a quick estimate by measuring the sell offs I expect this stock to probably land at $132.00 being the lowest   (due to panic selling pattern) but most likely around the low $133 area as buying and selling environment will change quickly for tomorrow morning.    I’m looking at $136 call strike for August 30th and if it doesn’t dip like how I predicted then I’ll just pass up the trade and try to find a new entry.  Does anyone have tips for entering with the dip but making sure you get a good entry by not paying too much with a high IV?  And should I go for August 23rd calls if I’m just going to obtain position for a quick profit and no intention of exercising?

"Buy SPY/QQQ, Sell EA","I wiped off my Cheetos fingers to give you guys this DD. 

If you haven't been following what's been going on at r/ApexLegends, essentially EA tried to introduce $18 lootboxes etc in natural EA form. If you remember a few months back, ApexLegends was going to be the gold cow to cash in on the PUBG/Fortnite adolescent faggy gamer population and EA's stock went up from $80 to $110. Not only that, the developers on the reddit called their fanbase with fragile snowflake feelings freeloaders and asshats and whatever (not worse than what we call each other here). 

This has not only killed the goose with the golden eggs, but probably helped to abort whatever freemium projects EA has down the line. Butthurt snowflakes would probably boycott, refuse to buy any packages, and set fire to their PC/XBOX/PS4 or whatever, and eventually stop playing the game. There is a natural death to many games, and EA just accelerated the death of AL. With no replacement soon and the probable aversion to it, EA will be hurt bad.

Then I looked at the primary market which drove those sales;  LUMBER.  


Lumber last year was up nearly 100%  
This year, for the same quarter it has reduced in price by nearly -25%  
This is going to make sales slump for HD!  
Also, the trade war with china has had an impact, so much so that home depot CEO has said ""They will be lowering profits in order to keep up with the raising tariff value so they can sell at the same value"".

-Had 0 instances of consecutive days of a 1.25% or more gain per day

-Had 4 instances of consecutive days of 1.25% or more loss per day

-Most consecutive days green was 3, done twice. 2 was done once.

-Most consecutive days red was 8, done once. 2 was done twice. 

-Consecutive days gaining, with a combined total of 2% or more, was done once.

-Consecutive days losing, with a combined  total of 2% or more, was done 8 times.

-Friday to Monday continuation has occurred the last 3 cycles. It finished Friday green.

-A green finish Monday keeps the cycle of Friday to Monday continuation, while also being the third instance of finishing 3 consecutive days green.

Recessions 101,"**Warning:** This is the one rare post on this sub where I'm actually going to be serious and leverage my education and experience. Will return to full spectrum Monday.

**Background:** I've seen a lot of posts and talk about recessions and how to profit on them. I just want to point out every recession is different, the tech bubble burst was different from the 2007/8 financial crisis. While you can place bets on which companies will go up and down, there are a few facts that will remain true. People will lose their jobs, there will be foreclosures, repossessions, and debt balances that go unpaid. This is unfortunate but all you autists want to know how to profit. I will try to explain why my thesis is a less risky play than betting on one specific point of failure. 

**Thesis:** While consumer confidence droops are in the headlines, it's still at a pretty healthy level and doesn't impact the thesis at all. We've been in an economic boom for almost a decade, people are spending money on things they do not need and over-extending on credit. While it might be harder to get a mortgage than it was pre-2008, car loans and credit cards have basically flooded the market. Spending on luxury goods for 2018 was $294B ([Source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinese-spending-represents-one-third-of-the-global-luxury-market-01553273079)). Take a look at this article for auto loans ([article](https://www.msci.com/www/blog-posts/are-subprime-auto-loans-at-a/01271628132)). The average credit card debt in the U.S is right around $6,000. **Regardless of whatever industry collapses, there will be unemployment and wage cuts, credit balances don't just vanish because you lost your job.** 

**Investment Opportunity:** 

# GO LONG ON DEBT COLLECTORS.

**Encore Capital Group**, an international specialty finance company, provides debt recovery solutions for consumers across a broad range of assets. Through its subsidiaries, the Company purchases portfolios of consumer receivables from major banks, credit unions, and utility providers, and partners with individuals as they repay their obligations and work toward financial recovery. Through its subsidiary in the United Kingdom, Cabot Credit Management, the Company is a market-leading acquirer and manager of consumer debt in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain. Encore's success and future growth are driven by its sophisticated and widespread use of analytics, its broad investments in data and behavioral science, significant cost advantages provided by its highly efficient operating model and proven investment strategy, and the Company's demonstrated commitment to conducting business ethically and in ways that support its consumers' financial recovery. 

**PRA Group:**  Our business was created in 1996 as a U.S. consumer debt-buying and collections company. Over time and by design, PRA Group has expanded and diversified throughout its 20-year history. PRA returns capital to banks and other creditors to help expand financial services for consumers in the Americas and Europe and provides a broad range of additional revenue and recovery services to business clients.

**Scenario 1:** Buy puts exp march 2020 since previous behavior for both has shown that when a recession occurs they bottom out.

After puts profit by close to ITM call LEAPS since they will begin to collect as the economy rebounds. 

**Scenario 2:** March 2020 calls. Both stocks went inverse $SPY this past month.

"The Volcker rule, or how I learned to start worrying but buy calls on financials anyway","# Ladies and Degenerates, clench your buttholes and place your bets, banks are about to catch a big break.

After the big banks fucked us all by gambling away our hardly-earned money we reigned them in with a set of rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, one of those being the Volcker rule.  This rule prevents banks from acting like WSB'ers and yoloing on options, investing in hedge funds, and a slew of other autistic shit that puts Robinhood users to shame.  The Volcker rule applies not only to American banks, but many foreign banks as well--it's basically the entire roll of red tape, including a litany of grey areas, and these motherfuckers absolutely *hate* it.

Rewind to 2017, Trump and the gang announced they didn't like Dodd-Frank and were going to do something about it, probably because these rich bankers have been lobbying against the damn thing since its inception.  Well the pot has been simmering for 2 long years, and its finally time for dinner.  Next Tuesday the FDIC will be voting on the Volcker rule 2.0, and while we don't know *exactly* whats in it, all the reporting on the subject cites sources as saying the banks are gonna like it.  The message they want you to see is that Volcker 2.0 isn't intended to give banks free reign to throw your savings at dumb yolos, but really is just about clarifying the rules.  The original was somewhat thrown together and doesn't fully account for the myriad of complicated situations that giant financial corporations with billions upon billions of dollars might find themselves in, especially as it relates to trading.  So, we're gonna make it all Barney style and easy to follow, and everyone will be happy...right?  If you believe that, you probably belong here.

Trump and his cronies clearly worship the almighty dollar and don't give a fuck about you or me, and while this is unlikely to be a total rewind to before Lehman Brothers; you better believe there will be some gems buried in there for the banks.  Pay close attention to if this vote passes and what *exactly* is in the new rule, because if it says they can use YOUR capital for risky investments we could potentially get another 2008, so buy calls.  WHAT?  But you said the banks are gonna fuck us!  Well...maybe...probably...or probably not, nobody really knows.  But if it does happen, it isn't going to happen Tuesday, or the Tuesday after, or the Tuesday after that. What IS going to happen is that banks are going to benefit from this, at the *very* least in the short term and probably for much longer after that.  Weren't you curious about why Buffett was buying up bank stocks last week?  Well, this is it.  Rate cuts eating into lending profits are about to matter a lot less.

Here's a snippet from Bloomberg

&gt;\- The Volcker 2.0 plan will tell banks that when they take stakes in third-party funds while underwriting or making markets for clients -- permitted activities under Dodd-Frank -- they don’t have to count it against overall limits for investing in private equity and hedge funds, the people said. The new rule would also boost the ability to hedge such investments and eliminate restrictions on certain foreign investment funds.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Volcker Revamp Could Free Banks to Boost Investment Fund Stakes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-16/volcker-revamp-could-free-banks-to-boost-investment-fund-stakes)

Did you catch that?  Underwriting and market making activities will no longer count against overall limits.  For those of you still drooling on the keyboard, that means banks will be allowed to *significantly* increase their liabilities in search of profits.  There will be more news and clarity about Volcker 2.0 in the coming days, but right now it looks like banks are chomping at the bit and the FDIC is about to open the gates.

# Just tell me to buy puts or calls!  Who cares about the motherVolcker rule?

First off, I don't care what you do.  It's not my fault if you lose your money.  I'm a degenerate just like you and I'll probably fuck this up even if I'm right, but I'm concentrating on financial stocks/ETF's with the best risk/reward ratio on their options.  BAC and XLF calls are hella cheap and cost very little in extra premium if you want to extend your expiration out farther than the FDs you're used to, but how can you not swing for the fences when the options are literally PENNIES.  Most of these stocks are usually very stable, so the options are wildly mispriced in your favor going into events like this.  If you all have some ticker suggestions I will update this later with a list of good candidates for the play, but if you just start looking at the financial sector you'll see that damn near all of them are on special right now.

# TL;DR

FDIC votes Tuesday to revamp the Volcker rule and allow banks to take more risk with their market-making activities, and clearly define grey areas that muddied the waters for both foreign and domestic entities.

**BUY CALLS ON FINANCIAL STOCKS/ETFs.**

# Shower thoughts

* The vote isn't guaranteed to pass, which could absolutely fuck FD calls.  Hedge with FD puts if you're worried, but these regulations WILL be loosened at some point as long as Cheeto and the Mnuch are around.
* Gyna, Rocket Man, Iran, and Brexit are still real things to worry about if you're thinking of buying long expiry calls.
* Don't forget we've got the FOMC coming up and we're expecting rate cuts.  One could argue that they are priced in already but nobody knows whats going to happen till it happens, and shit always gets wild when JPow steps up to the mic.  Plan accordingly.
* Be aware that if the Volcker 2.0 rule is too lenient it has the potential to cause big problems down the road.  If banks get too wild with their new freedoms and something unexpected happens causing them to get margin called, it'll be 2008 all over again.  Buy some gold bars and a safe if you're worried, but make sure you put your tin foil hat on first beartards.
* I'm out of soap.

The case to short Baidu,"The Chinese giant has had near stagnant growth in the past couple of quarters. The YoY quarterly growth is pacing down. Last quarter they missed the EPS consensus by $0.02.

Investors are staying away from most Chinese companies given the current geopolitical state. Plus, if a recession is coming, it will surely hit Asia and Europe first. Investors are moving their money back into U.S. companies, where they know they can ride the bull for at least another 16 months, or after the presidential election.

If you think Google is bad at censoring. Take Baidu, where their search engine is a walled garden. Top search results on any topic, always favors different publishing platforms owned by Baidu itself.

Chinese people are growing skeptic of Baidu. And increasing competition, not from Google, but WeChat, ByteDance (the biggest startup) makes the PR headache an inopportune nightmare for Baidu.

In its post on WeChat, ByteDance said the search engine will come ""with better user experience,"" seemingly taunting Baidu, which recently came under fire for its alleged preferences for its own content over other news providers.

On July 14, almost 60K contracts (09/20 $165p) were bought. Since then, the stock has declined around 15%.

Baidu revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2019 was $3.594B, a 9.28% INCREASE year-over-year.

"I shorted Argentina and i was right, now hear my next play","First of all a few things to tell,

My previous post was deleted because as i am new at wsb i didn't read the fucking rules and i got banned. Thats one thing but I'm over with it.

I learned a lot of things first of all that wsb is indeed more retarded than it looks, and most you guys take options as literally gambling and do absolutely no DD whatsoever.

i was also in the middle of a crisis because my family will face an imminent financial crisis and that is fucking hard for all the guys that supported me while some autist where trash-talking me. IM HERE TO STAY.

Now, more DD, i was right before and i think i am right again. On Monday of this week, the etf was down more than 25% while even most of the Argentina adr on wall street fell 50%.  Also, the local currency devaluated more than 22%. Against a parity between us dollar and the Argentine peso.

[https://imgur.com/a/3mcFwzQ](https://imgur.com/a/3mcFwzQ)

As you may see this week was as an absolute shitshow.

How can we profit?

A few things happened during the week.

First and most important is that the international monetary fund president Christine Lagarde talked with the winning party of the elections and ""apparently"" they will not default on the loan.

Second, the current president Mauricio Macri, both in fear of not getting reelected plus as a necessity to help the taxpayers. Imposed serious economic reforms. The most important one is that, ""basically"" the taxation is going to be lowered to mid-income citizens, then food will not have aggregated sale tax. The cost of this economics reforms is estimated to be worth 100000 million pesos,  the government thinks that the inner circulation of capital will reactivate the economy.

Third, since most of the argentine stocks in wall street fell for more than 60% in some cases, there had been announced that some stocks will be privately bought back in order to increase its intrinsic value. How much are they gonna be bough back is uncertain. Pampa Energia which is one of the most important energy distributors in Argentina confirmed that they will invest 50 million usd in buying back the stock. (this is legit no elon musk twitter bullshit).  [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PAM/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PAM/)

Most stocks such as ggal and ypf are expected to do the same. These stocks integrate on a large scale the etf.

To finish of there is no more money on the streets most of it has been already put to us treasury bonds or some type   of private usd hedge fund.

My predictions.....

While is it way more easy to predict that a stock is going to go down. The criteria i followed led me to belive the opposite in this situation.

I predict that the  **Global X MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT)**  will hit 26.20 at a 85% of assurance and that it will hit 26.85 at 60% of assurance. And that it will hit 27 at 35% of assurance.

I predict that GGAL will hit 18.10 by Monday and that it will continue to grow up to 20.10 at the rest of the week. (it is a very good stock to hold tho)

I have insufficient data to predict MELI or YPF. So don't ask, please.

 **GE Is Hiding $29 Billion ($29B) in Long-Term Care Losses**   


(Get used to the acronym LTC) according to this report. He lists off 3 ""Key Risks to GE's survival"".   
1. recession (Bear gang)  
2. in 2021 GE will cease to have any positive cash flow. while simultaneously taking a $29B reserve hit for it's LTC liabilities. (Specifically Q1 2021)   
3. Assuming they survive both listed above, it will then have to repay $107B in debt, cover its $27B in pension liabilities.  (Note: He claims that GE has no cash and only earned $14.9B over last 7-years and these liabilities total over $160B)  


He then goes on to state that GE LTC situation is similar to AIG's Financial Products Corporation, which destroyed AIG. Compares AIG enjoying ""earnings"" as GE has reported. GE Capital (GEC) accounted for LTC insurance premiums in their earnings in the 1980's, 90's, and 2000's while also not funding adequate reserves to offset the LTC liabilities.   


So far, 14% f LTC claims being filed has lead to a $15B reserve hit, 86.2% remain. ""GE’s LTC losses will  
continue rising at an exponential rate until it either files for bankruptcy protection or finds some way to out-earn its  
LTC liabilities."" They looked at the accounting by accessing and analyzing the SAP (statutory accounting rules) filings from the LTC insurers who were reinsuring with GE-ERAC showed them how much GE was losing each year. They found exponentially growing losses that they claim will bleed GE of additional cash such that GE is unlikely to become cash positive in 2021 and beyond (buzz lightyear voice).   


They analyzed GE's 7 largest reinsurance deals, which account for approx. 95% of GE's total LTC reinsurance liabilities. They also analyzed GE's own reinsurer LifeCare. (You can see details on each reinsurance deal in Appendix I of the report) They provide notes throughout the report on how you can track down the reports/data yourself if you don't believe them.   


They calculated GE should have taken a reserve hit as early as 2012, but no later than 2015. Instead GE waited for new management to come in and book what little reserve they could afford in late 2017/early 2018, a $15B commitment which required a special exemption from the Kansas Insurance Department (KID) to spread over a 7-year period because GE isn't liquid right now and likely won't survive long enough to make their last few years of reserve payments anyway.  


GE’s $15 Billion LTC reserve hit was a nasty market surprise and it’s about to get $29 Billion worse.  


While looking through the analysis, ask yourself 3 questions:   
1. Who's being transparent - GE or them  
2. Who's showing GE's reinsurance losses by carrier by year, by dollar amount - GE or them  
3. Who's accounting do you trust more?  


They show a comparison of GE to a responsible insurance carrier such as Prudential (PRU), GE needs $18.5B in additional reserves in order to be able to pay claims. GE also has a $10.5B difference between its $30.4B in statutory reserves and it's $19.9B of GAAP reserves. This difference will lead to a non-cash charge to earnings between now and the new insurance accounting rule change, which goes into effect in 1QTR 2021. This policy will result in a $10.5B hit to GE's shareholder equity cushion and put its credit rating and debt covenants at grave risk.   


""To summarize, GE is hiding $29 Billion in additional  
LTC losses from investors and our Whistleblower Report will walk you through the details using figures provided by eight  
of GE’s LTC counter-parties. Either those eight companies are lying and reporting false data or GE is.""  


They end the LTC section with 2 questions for GE's management of LTC:  
1. Make your agreements public  
2. provide your LTC actuarial assumptions   
(neither of which are questions)  
\-----  
**GE Is Hiding $9.1 Billion in Baker Hughes Losses**  


GE's 2017 investment in Baker Hughes was bad and forced them to exit that investment in November 2018 when they sold 101.2 million BHGE shares in a secondary offering. GE booked a $2.2B pre-tax loss from that sale. GE then continued to account for it's shares in BHGE as a Non-Controlling Interest in 2018, despite the holding now strictly being an investment. If they had treated it as an investment, as accounting rules require, it would have incurred a $9.1B loss.   


\------  
**Why Didn’t GE Disclose Its Working Capital of Minus $20.3B and Its Current Ratio of .67?**  


""The same $52B of Baker Hughes assets and $22B of revenues are reported on both GE’s 2018 financial statements  
and BHGE’s where in reality, only one entity, BHGE actually controls these assets and cash flows. Backing out BHGE’s  
cash flow from operating activities (CFOA) reduces GE’s 2018 CFOA from $2.257B to a meager $495M.""  


""GE’s 2018 year-ending working capital was minus $14.3B with BHGE and minus $20.3B without!"" GE then wilfully omitted working capital reports and disclosures in their 10-K and only discusses changes in working capital, but never gives you a true picture of their dire financial position. Provided in the report are working capital schedules for GE both with and without BGGE (Slide 104).  


GE's current ratio is a stunningly low .67. The current ratio is not listed in GE's 2018 10-K so this is a number they had to calculate themselves.   
Final 3 questions for KPMG, GE's auditors dating back to 1909:  
1. What did you know?  
2. When did you know it?  
3. Where's your ""Going Concern Opinion?""  


\-----  


The remainder of the report goes into how they analyzed GE and discovered the Fraud and the cues that have been missed by investors and analysts. Concluding remark that I thought was important to humanize the extent of this fraud:  
""I want to express my sympathy to the one million people who count on GE for either salaries, healthcare, or  
pensions. Make no mistake, GE’s current and past employees are the victims here as are GE’s lenders, vendors, and  
customers all of whom have to deal with the aftermath of an accounting fraud. The only winners are GE’s fat cat  
executives who enriched themselves with undeserved bonuses as they drove this once proud beacon of American  
business into the ground. I encourage you to hold them accountable.  
Thank you very much for taking the time to read our Whistleblower Report, we hope you find it informative.

Exhibit B:
On 7/17/19 spy was 297.74
On 4/26/19 spy was 293.41
The average of those 2 numbers is 295.57

BTFD NOW ON BYND!!!!!!,"So I'm real excited, I'm new here and trying to figure out if I'm new here and have being trying to decide between 🐂 gang or 🐻gang so I was doing some research. 

Look at this

&gt; While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, ***the remaining six species are*** ***omnivorous*** ***with varied diets.*** With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days. 

Let me repeat that,

&gt; ***the remaining six species are*** ***omnivorous*** ***with varied diets.***

For the mathleets out there, that's 6/8 bear species eat non-meat products. Once Bears discover their first BYND burger their going to be hooked, BYND will fly off the shelves!

Straight forward trading Strategy.,"I’ve been enlightened. Since discovering this shit thread and options, I’ve lost roughly $2,500 (in 5 months). That’s not much for some, but it could have paid off the rest of my car loan. Instead I pissed it away on stupid OTM ER option plays that didn’t work out 90% of the time. I’m an actual idiot, I know. 

I did some soul searching and I think I’m going to make the transitions back to regular investing, but the investments will only be in companies that made products that I use. I am going to still dabble in options except I won’t buy FD’s on Tsla 420. 

Here is my shit DD on 3 stocks I plan on buying AND holding. 

Chewy (CHWY): I recently got a puppy, and chewy has been an amazing company. Their products are top tier, they customer service is comparable to chick-fil-a. I mean it’s fucking top notch. Their delivery speed is incredible and the prices are as low as you can find. If you know millennials, you’ll know that they spare no expense on pet stuff. LONG CHWY!

Kohl’s (KSS): I know what you’re thinking.. “Who the fuck invests in brick and mortar stores?? Are you stupid!”.  Well, I shop at kohl’s regularly, their prices are reasonable as shit, their kohl’s cash is basically free money to use on more dumb shit to buy there. I bought my first suit there for $100 and tailored it for another $50. It’s my favorite suit and I got my first big boy job wearing it. It’s surprisingly super nice and to the untrained eye, people couldn’t even tell that I spent pennies on the suit. Also, middle class families (moms) spend hundreds on clothes for their kids. The clothing is affordable and pretty good in terms of quality. Moms love that place. Finally Amazon partnered with kohl’s in terms of that kohl’s accepts amazon returns and will ship it back for you. This partnership is just the beginning of a strong relationship with amazon. What if there was a possibility of a buy out in the next decade?! 

Microsoft (MSFT): Microsoft rules the computer space. They’re constantly evolving and improving. I mean shit, who doesn’t have windows on their PC/laptop. They’re sitting on a shitload of cash, they’re never fucking their investors and I just like them. 

Ok so there’s my 3 picks for going long and strong. 

If I were to go back to options, I’m going to do leaps on these stocks.

Germany is going to tank hard,"Ok here me out: Germany’s economy isn’t looking to good right now, we all know that. But I know something you guys don’t know. I’m German and I read the newspaper. I understand the country. I know how people think.
I can guarantee German stocks are overvalued right now. Why? Because most investors are American and they don’t understand that Germany isn’t the US.

What I’m essentially saying is that Germany won’t stimulate the economy even though they should.
Why? Well to understand that I’ll have to take you back on a quick history lesson, back to the financial crisis. Back then Germany wasn’t competitive at all, stuff sucked, companies didn’t want to invest in Germany because work was expensive. The SPD, the „socialist“ party made a bunch of reforms back then, reducing cost of labor. That shit worked really well, as we all know. Germany has been doing great.
Well here comes the interesting point: people hated the SPD for that. They were at like 40% back then, they’ve been nosediving harder than analfarmers portfolio. 

This basically showed all parties people don’t want effective economic stimulus, they want their Gouvernement money. They don’t understand that the right thing might be to have people get less.
 
Reason two why they won’t do something against the recession: the biggest party, the CDU, the Merkel guys, have been tanking as well. But they have one thing people like about them: „schwarze Null“, their black zero. Basically the Gouvernement not taking up any debt. Thing is we already know they’re not gonna cut benefits because people hate that and if you don’t take up debt and don’t reduce spending you definitely can’t stimulate the economy, especially when incomes and thus taxes are falling.

Third reason why: „Die Grünen“, the Green Party is on the rise. And these people are left wing and don’t give a fuck about the economy. They see companies as the source of CO2. These fuckers are gonna raise taxes, not reduce them. 

Fourth reason: „die Linke“, the left party, the former east Germany party and the AFD, basically the German Trump party, are on the rise. And you don’t want tarriff man or socialists when a recession hits. These fuckers won’t be part of the gouvernment but they’re gonna make the Gouvernements work way harder than it already is.


I think you already know about the ECB but what you may not know is that the German people want higher rates so their fixed income bank deposit shitshows can give them money. Germany is going to fight the ECB while Italy and Greece are going to force the ECB to lower rates to never seen lows.

And this is only going to hurt when the recession hits. But Germany is already not looking to good. And tariff man and Gyna aren’t making this look better. So when the recession hits Germany’s parties are going to continue giving freebies to the people while leaving taxes this high. Germany is walking right into a Recession and no one is going to stop it.

Algos will read this information ""buy the dip."" Now algos are way more complex than we understand, and as a HTML coder myself with vast experience I can tell you these algos are going to buy $PEP.

Why? Well lets think like an algo for a second. When advanced algos reads ""buy the dip"" it will obviously search for who is selling the dip. Now the most common type of dip type is cheese, and we all love Tostitos. $PEP makes not only the tortillas but they have various other dips.

DD: Buy GO calls,"So GO closes at 37.59 yesterday, has a great AH earnings report for its very first one since IPO and goes up 12%, everyone everywhere fluffing them up as a great long term buy. Now it's somehow down to 38 after hours today after a market dip of 3%. Unless an IPOs first earnings report smashing expectations has somehow been priced in for a month, which makes no fucking sense, this feels way underpriced for now.

They don't buy shit from China so they don't have to worry about Trump tweets. And yes, retail is hurting, but it's hurting because people can buy the same shit for the same price or less online without leaving home, and they can't do that with stores like GO - not only because they're grocery and buying groceries on a place like Amazon is like shitting your wallet down a toilet, but they are far cheaper than any other options and will stay that way. People love getting deals and stretching their dollar, or perhaps put another way, they don't like the thought of pissing money away if they can avoid it by overpaying for shit, and the earnings report proved all that. When I had discovered this place when a new location popped up near me, a few years back, the first time in there I couldn't not look at every single thing in the store awestruck on the pricing. They had 5 lb blocks of white cheddar Velveeta for $8 when 1 lb is like $7-$8 at other places. CHEESE George, CHEEE^(EEESE!)

Macy's on the other hand blows, as their ER proved, because they're trying to sell you $50 shit for $100-$200 when you can easily find it for $50 online. Perhaps great when the wealthy made up 1%, but now it's like 0.1% and the rest of people aren't havin' it. Oh right, you can go to their closeouts and look through racks of random shit for 2 hours and hope to find that $50 online item there for $49.95, I forgot. Plus people in general are shying away from department stores because they could just shop online and have an extra hour of not aimlessly walking around a department store to do things like absolutely nothing with. That's partly why JC's Pennies.

So GO calls make sense to me. I did this shit with OLLI just yesterday for the same sort of reason after it inexplicably went down 5% the day before, and sold at 49% profit on a pretty modest play (the YOLO play would've been 82.50 calls for 350%+ gain).

Maybe not buy calls for 8/16 unless you feel extra YOLOrific because who tf knows what crazy shit is happening tomorrow and Friday, but 8/23 or further out to give time for investors to get a clue.

Disclaimer: The aforementioned OLLI trade was my first ever, 2nd ever was an APPL put mid-day today expecting the China tariff news yesterday would wash away today on a down market, got away from it with a 3% gain after that didn't happen, and this marks #3 and a strangle on SPY for next Weds as #4 giving this ridic volatility, so we'll see. I am on the spectrum and have had success investing in other areas, and have observed this place and options for about a year before diving into it.

To Recession or not to recession? That is the question...,"Look at all the fancy numbers!  Keep in mind, today was largely algo driven.  Literally scalped /ES five or six times today just by watching the spread between the 2/10 year widen, waited for it to begin narrowing, algos kick in and start selling, short /ES, close position when spread begins to widen.  

Just keep in mind, algos drive moves like this.  Algos triggered sell when the spread narrowed and triggered buy when it widened.  They do the same thing for Trump's tweets.  Positive tariff news triggers BUY ALL THE THINGS (look at yesterday's markets).

So remember, w/ the VIX above 20 again, all that means is that markets are volatile.  Volatility doesn't just swing down but swings up as well.  **It also means options premium is VERY EXPENSIVE relative to two weeks ago.**  

**In this vol environment, this is a great opportunity to sell premium and wait for vol contraction.  One might consider selling 16 delta SPY or /ES 45DTE and wait for vol to get sucked out.**

\-JD.com, another Chinese E-Commerce giant, reported strong earnings today and spiked 13%, signaling that, per Barrons, a strong middle class and growing disposable income means that e-commerce in China is doing well and is relatively unaffected by the trade war.

Fuck CGC. Long MedMen. Part 2 - 20% gains in one day so far,"NOTE: THIS STOCK IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ROBINHOOD 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 2 days since I made this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp4e97/fuck\_cgc\_long\_medmen/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp4e97/fuck_cgc_long_medmen/?sort=new) 

MedMen is currently **up over 20% from yesterday. And we're just getting started.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why are we up 20% in 1 day? Will these tendies keep cooking?** 

This morning, MedMen announced pro forma sales of  [$61M USD](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/medmen-sees-q4-revenue-at-42-million/)  \- up 15% since last quarter.

With more US cannabis companies' earnings being released tomorrow (CWEB premarket, ACRG aftermarket), I believe we will see strong bullish continuation tomorrow as investors shift their focus from the Canadian sector to the US, where the % gain on investment will be exponentially larger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Retail Locations** 

MedMen's current earnings period was based on only **37 retail stores, providing $61M USD in pro forma sales.**

Pending acquisition closures, MedMen will be licensed for **92 retail locations** across 12 states. 

MedMen currently has only 1 store open in Florida, but are on track to open 11 additional stores by the end of 2019. They are licensed to open up to 35 retail locations and have over 20 leases already secured at prime locations within the state.  

Florida is an extremely important state in the US Cannabis Sector. Currently, cannabis is only legal for medical purposes, but  [it is the nation's fastest-growing medical marijuana market](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/marijuana/florida-is-americas-fastest-growing-medical-marijuana-market-11161345), with over 10,000+ people signing up per month. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cash Burn &amp; Cash Position**

While the top-line growth is impressive, there was never a doubt MedMen would be able to sell product. Cash burn was always a legitimate concern though. With the difficulty raising capital in this industry (no access to banking, or non-dilutive financing), high cash burn means frequent share dilution. 

The company announced today that they are on track for an approximate **30% overall reduction** in corporate SG&amp;A from the Dec. 2018 quarter. It's my belief that big money is closely monitoring this metric and will use this sign of positive corporate governance as initiative to begin buying larger positions of the stock. 

MedMen now has access to up to $280M USD over the next year or so from the Gotham Green Partners' investment mentioned in my previous post. They are perhaps in the healthiest cash position of any US cannabis company now and are set for aggressive expansion into more states as they legalize.

&amp;#x200B;

**Political Factors (don't argue politics in the comments please, you savage fucks)**

I don't want to make this post political, so I will focus on **what we know so far.** 

There two likely scenarios in the November 2020 election:

1. **Trump Wins.**  [Republican Senator, Cory Gardner has confirmed on multiple occasions that Trump will support individual states' rights on cannabis reform.](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/19/cory-gardner-donald-trump-supports-marijuana-refor/)  More states will slowly come online as they see states like Colorado, California, and Illinois reaping the tax rewards of adult-use laws.
2. **A Democrat Wins.**  [All of the top democratic candidates support legalization at the federal level, except for Joe Biden.](https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/2020-presidential-candidates-marijuana-positions) That said, Joe Biden's plan notes that he will not stand in the way of individual states legalizing, and he is on board for federal decriminalization and federal legalization for medical usage.

Whatever ends up happening will not negatively affect MedMen. If it is up to individual states to make the decision, then we will likely see a protected and restricted market in which MedMen will continue to play the game of monopoly between the other few players.

If federal legalization happens, it likely won't be until at least March 2021, after a new president potentially takes office. By then, MedMen will have massive market share and will be ready to serve the massive influx of new users.

Chairman of Privateer Holdings, and CEO of Tilray  [said today](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/13/tilray-earnings-q2-2019.html);  *regardless of who wins the US presidential election next year, he expects the US to legalize marijuana... ""I think the tide has really turned and it doesn't really matter who's president in terms of cannabis legalization...It's really one of the few issues that has bipartisan support in Washington, DC.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**Economic Hedge**

Many blue chip stocks are at, or near all time highs. The trade war and interest rate factors have some people panicking over a potential recession or market crash. It's my belief that the cannabis industry would be fairly resistant to such events. It is also my belief that considering the infancy of the industry, there is far more room for growth in the cannabis industry than most blue chip stocks at these current levels.

&amp;#x200B;

**MedMen is still significantly undervalued.**

Due to pressure from shorts, and FUD attacks in the media, the stock is bogged and is still trading at a significantly lower quarterly price to sales ratio than its peers.

**Acreage Holdings** (Canopy Growth's US investee) announced pro-forma quarterly revenue of **$36.6M USD today**. Their fully diluted market cap is **\~$1.42 Billion USD.**

**MedMen** announced preliminary pro-forma quarterly revenue of **$61.3M USD today.** Their fully diluted market cap is **\~$1.52 Billion USD.**

&amp;#x200B;

**US Sector is getting spicy.**

Before market open tomorrow, Charlotte's Web will be announcing earnings. Their low float stock is poised to run on a potential beat. If they beat considerably, they are capable of pulling the entire US cannabis sector for a ride as more money is pulled out of the Canadian sector and dumped into the US space.

After market close tomorrow, Trulieve will be announcing earnings. They are expected to have  [\~$53M in revenue.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TCNNF/analysis/) Their fully diluted market cap is \~$1.08 Billion USD. What is notable however, is that they are only operating in Florida. Their cost to expand into other states is likely to come at the costs of current shareholders as dilution will be necessary. They are a very dominant player in Florida, however with MedMen and other companies now entering the state, it is expected their growth will slow down, as they are already at their maximum capacity for number of stores allowed in the state.

Calls on EA because EPIC sucks. DD inside.,"Alright- been hanging around this sub so much that I've stopped playing video games- and that means I'm less at risk to ruin your puts on firearms options, so trust me on this, since I'm ***obviously*** an expert.  


You all know EA- it's basically a meme and highly stigmatized within the gaymer community because they do stuff like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?st=JH2MUORV&amp;sh=5997c5a5), which is a good indicator of how the stock literally asks to go tits up. The stock the week after the comment was made *\[Sun Nov 12 2017 14:11:23 GMT-0500 (EST)\]* shows it falling, because MEMES [do have an impact on public opinion](https://imgur.com/a/r9VNri1).  ""EA bad \[insert literally ANYTHING here\] good"" rhetoric has been tossed around, till it's been replaced by ""FoRTnITe BaD"" \[insert shit here\] good."" Now, those of you who have kids/nephews/grow-ass men in your basement who play the game will know that for all the hate it gets- it makes EPIC BIG TENDIES. And what else do you love more, since it's not a publicly traded stock- than to have it fall?   


Enter **Apex Legends**\- the bastard child of battle royale games and the Titanfall series, which has a chacter that perfectly represents [WSB](https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/apex-legends-octane.jpg). The dude literally likes to shoot up on questionable substances, is Green (BULL GANG), and can yeet himself off a lauchpad like me yeeting myself off a 20-story nodescript office building because of my AMD calls. What more can you ask?   


Over at r/FortniteCompetitive they're getting so frustrated with EPIC they're moving over to Apex legends to protest, which means a bunch of gambling addicts and big name streamers are going to get hooked on the game, and buy a shit ton of overpriced lootboxes- I mean, just look at FIFA. Shit makes EA money EVERY. SINGE. TIME even though people talk shit about it. So basically, more people playing the game -&gt; More people buying stuff -&gt; more profit for Respawn + EA. 

  
**TL;DR Check**  r/FortniteCompetitive **- they're all migrating over to Apex Legends because EPIC Devs suck. New people, new tendies.**

**Today’s Bullish Activity**

Leading the point gainers list this morning is **Deciphera Pharmaceuticals Inc. (DCPH + $19.30 to $39.25)** after the drug developer said that its lead drug (ripretinib) achieved the main goal of preventing cancer from progressing in patients with a form of stomach cancer (gastrointestinal stromal tumors) in an updated Phase 1 study. Results from the study showed that patients treated with ripretinib had a progression-free survival rate of 6.3 months compared with 1 month in placebo cases. The company said that the data supports an ongoing intrigue Phase 3 clinical study in patients with second-line gist. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 5:2 which is primarily being driven by activity on the August 16th 25.00 put (volume is 1,540).   

Also trading to the upside is **JD.com Inc. (JD + $2.87 to $30.03)** after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported Q2 earnings of RMB 2.30 per share, excluding non-recurring items (RMB 1.76 better than the RMB 0.54 expected) on revenue that increased 22.9% year-over-year to RMB 150.28B (above the RMB 147.44B consensus estimate). Annual active customer accounts increased to 321.3M from 310.5M quarter-over-quarter. Looking ahead, the company said it expects Q3 revenue to come in a range of RMB 126-130B versus the RMB 126.13B consensus estimate. Shares of JD are trading above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $29.27 at the time of this writing. Call volume is dominating (\~4:1 over puts w/all of the top 10 contracts being a call) with the August 16th 31.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 0,494).  

Lastly, shares of **McDonald’s Inc. (MCD + $2.19 to $219.35)** are trading higher after MKM Partners initiated coverage on the fast food chain with a “Buy” rating and $250.00 price target, citing strong sales growth, cash flow and solid same-store sales generation. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 5:2 with the August 16th 222.50 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 1,114).

New 52-week highs (59 new highs today): **Amgen Inc. (AMGN + $2.96 to $208.74), Five9 Inc. (FIVN + $2.10 to $63.39), Roku Inc. (ROKU + $4.54 to $138.84), AT&amp;T Inc. (T + $0.30 to $34.79)**

**Notable Call Activity**

Some unusual call activity (\~11:1 over puts) is being seen in the **iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV - $0.07 to $15.91)** as all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts. The most actively traded contract is the September 20th 16.00 call as volume is 42,594 (vs. open interest of 120,260). The majority of the transactions on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.46.

**Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC + $1.24 to $47.59):** Calls are outpacing puts roughly 25:1 as option traders primarily target the October 18th 60.00 call. Volume on this contract is 9,327 (vs. open interest of 23,464) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.25. From a technical perspective, shares of MPC appear to be staging a bounce from an area where the stock bounced back in late May (today’s low = $45.64, May 31st low = $45.47).

**Today’s Bearish Activity** 

Multiple stocks are moving lower following disappointing earnings/guidance:

* **Advanced Auto Parts Inc. (AAP - $2.09 to $140.07):** The auto parts retailer reported Q2 earnings of $2.00 per share ($0.21 miss) on revenue that rose 0.2% year-over-year to $2.33B (below the $2.30B expected) as comparable same-store sales were flat year-over-year. The company issued downside guidance as full-year 2019 revenue is expected to come in a range of $9.65-9.75B (below the $9.76B expected) and lowered comparable same-store sales guidance to +1.0-2.0% from +1.0-2.5%. Shares of AAP hit a low of $130.09 near the open this morning but have recovered substantially off that level at the time of this writing. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 4:3 with the August 16th 145.00 call garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 3,179).
* **Bloom Energy Corp. (BE - $2.80 to $5.20):** The clean-energy company reported a Q2 loss of $0.13 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.06 beat) on revenue that rose 38.4% year-over-year to $233.8M (above the $207.56M expected) as acceptances were 271 (vs. 250-280 guidance). Looking ahead, the company said it expects Q3 acceptances to be 280-310 with average selling price to come in a range of $6,300-6,600. Puts are outnumbering calls better than 2:1 with the November 15th 6.00 put topping the most actives list (volume is 1,003).
* **Covetrus Inc. (CVET - $9.88 to $13.31):** The provider of animal-health technology and services reported Q2 adjusted earnings of $0.13 per share ($0.03 miss) on net sales of $1.01B (flat year-over-year and in-line with estimates). The company lowered guidance as adjusted EBITDA is expected to be “at least $200M” (vs. prior expectations of $235-250M) and said it expects organic net sales growth to come in the “low single digits” (vs. a prior forecast of +3-5%). Shares of CVET are trading at all-time lows this morning. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the January 2021 22.50 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 110).

New 52-week lows (185 new lows today): **Alcoa Corp. (AA + $0.79 to $19.31), Baidu Inc. (BIDU + $3.32 to $98.40), F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV + $2.59 to $133.07), Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG + $0.86 to $13.95), United States Steel Corp. (X + $0.59 to $12.20)**

**Notable Put Activity**

Some unusual put activity (\~39:1 over calls) is being seen in the **SPDR S&amp;P Regional Bank ETF (KRE + $0.79 to $50.94)** as all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts are puts. However, not all of the activity appears to be bearish in nature. The most actively traded contract is the January 2020 41.00 put (volume is 5,164 vs. open interest of 345) which mostly consisted of various sized blocks that were being sold at the bid price of $0.70. The activity suggests that the put sellers either believe that KRE will close at or above $41.00 (in which the premium received will be kept) or are comfortable taking a long position in the ETF at an effective purchase price of $40.30 in the even that KRE closes below $41.00 at expiration.

**Volume Signals** 

**Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ + $0.38 to $54.63):** Option volume is running at over 10x the daily average of 1,062 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 57.50 call. Volume on this contract is 12,108 (vs. open interest of 4,849) which included a 5,478 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.40. We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

**PG&amp;E Corp. (PCG + $0.21 to $16.97):** Option volume is running at roughly 3.5x the daily average of 10,521 contracts which is primarily being driven by a 30K block that was bought on the August 30th 19.00 call at the ask price of $0.85 (open interest of 153). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

**Newmont Goldcorp (NEM - $0.78 to $37.68):** Option volume is running at roughly 4x the daily average of 7,958 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the August 23rd 37.00 put. Volume on this contract is 35,575 (vs. open interest of 92) which most consisted of various sized blocks that were being sold for between $0.57-0.60. The activity suggests that the put sellers either believe that NEM will close at or above $37.00 (in which the premium received will be kept) or are comfortable taking a long position in the stock in the event that NEM closes below $37.00 at expiration.

**Gauging Volatility**

The **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 3.41 to 17.68)** has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 17.68-21.64) as equity markets are firmly higher across the board around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 440, SPX + 50, COMPX + 161). VIX option volume has been above average today at 568,514 contracts (#3 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.24). The most actively traded contract is the August 21st 18.00 call as volume is 55,788 versus open interest of 194,191.",TodayInTheMahket,1565723426,19,9,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpxsww/options_market_8319/

BYND Aramark inks contract to offer Beyond faux meat,"Likely the reason for the pop today. IB has 54k shares available to short and a borrow rate of 61%, so the short squeeze thesis is in reverse at the moment. (borrow rate is falling) but looks like new contracts bailing them out, for today, at least.  Aramark serves 2bn meals a year. So even a small penetration rate can have a pretty big impact on BYND numbers without the need to pay for shelf space.

Article from Fox Business:

Plant-based protein options are becoming more widely available as the popularity of faux meats has begun to surge.

Now, food service provider Aramark says it will offer [**Beyond Meat**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/food-and-beverage) burgers, sausages and other items on its menus at schools, [**hospitals,**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/health-care) ballparks and other businesses. The deal has the potential to bring Beyond Meat’s foods to many new diners, as Aramark said it serves nearly 2 billion meals each year.

Aramark’s Beyond Meat offerings include a gumbo bowl with Beyond Sausage for hospital patients, a Caribbean-inspired Beyond Burger with black beans, avocado, pineapple and Sriracha sold at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Beyond Sausage with fried shallots at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City and Beyond Sausage brats at Citi Field in Queens, New York.

“The trick for us is to develop and offer unique meatless options that taste great and appeal to consumers who might want to try something new and those who follow plant-forward diets,” said Heidi Hogan, Aramark’s vice president of product development and culinary innovation.

The company said it has found that 60 percent of consumers want to [**reduce**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/lifestyle-and-budget) their meat consumption. Many of them pointed to health and weight management as their reasons for cutting back on meat.

“Early on, we understood that consumer preferences were driving a need for quality plant-forward offerings and our culinary team has been working with a broad range of plant-based products to create more enticing menu choices,” Hogan said.

The announcement came just days after Aramark competitor [**Sodexo**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/impossible-burger-coming-to-schools-hospitals) announced a partnership with Beyond Meat competitor Impossible Foods.

Aramark said it had already been working on a “plant-forward initiative” aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The company said it has developed more than 200 new plant-based recipes and that 30 percent of its menu offerings are now vegan or vegetarian.

The food service provider has also recently partnered with plant-based egg replacement maker JUST and Ocean Hugger Foods, which makes plant-based tuna alternative Ahimi, for temporary additions to its menus at some higher education and corporate facilities.

Fuck CGC. Long MedMen.,"**USA  &gt; Canada**

The Canadian cannabis market is saturated and over-regulated. Canopy and the other big players in Canada have made too many bad investments and are going to be suffering from goodwill impairment and writedowns, with lower than expected revenues due to Canada's pussyfooting on regulations. The US is far different, and allows for advertising, branding, without a government middleman stealing profit margins. MedMen is the largest cannabis retailer in California, a state with higher population and usage rates than all of Canada combined. Medmen has  [7% of the market share in California](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190529005899/en/MedMen-Reports-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2019-Financial). Analysts believe that [California could reach $25 billion in sales by 2026](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/california-cannabis-market-expected-to-reach-51-billion-market-value-685917412.html), while the rest of the entire US combined only accounting for $25 billion.

**The Cronos Connection**

Gotham Green Partners recently committed to a total of $280M USD investment in MedMen. This appears to be their largest investment made to date. Gotham Green were the early backers of Cronos (when it was known as PharmaCan Capital Corp).

**The Chairman, President, &amp; CEO of Cronos-** **Mike Gorenstein** is a co-founder and member of **Gotham Green Partners.**

**Independent Director of Cronos- Jason Adler** is a co-founder of **Gotham Green Partners** and is a Managing Member.

US Federal laws and American Exchange rules do not allow Cronos to invest in US cannabis companies. This is important to note, as it shows that Gotham Green could be acting as an investment arm of Cronos, and holding stakes in US companies for when the US federally legalizes, or when/if the STATES Act passes.

**US Federal Law**

US Federal Laws do not allow banks to work with US cannabis companies. Therefore, hedge funds, and other institutional investors are extremely hesitant to invest in them. This is a very rare opportunity for retail to invest in companies before big money enters and drives prices up. The same thing happened in Canada not long ago.  The [current institutional ownership of MedMen is extremely low.](https://imgur.com/a/T7rzPfM) Check out [ACB's current ownership summary for comparison](https://imgur.com/a/BAm1nRR).

**Market Manipulation &amp; Current Discount**

MedMen has been beaten up in the media and shorts have been hammering the stock. Many retail investors have blacklisted the stock and refuse to invest in the company due to some very wild allegations and cash burn worries. The FUD spreading, combined with big money's inability to participate in the US cannabis industry, leaves for a discounted stock price.

MedMen is currently trading at $2.41 CAD. This is well below Gotham Green Partners' average cost of $3.37 CAD.

The stock price tanking allowed Gotham Green Partners to get a repricing on their deal (was higher than $3.37 CAD before).

I believe that it's probable that the stock was manipulated down to secure this better deal.  SEC Data  shows that on the run up to July 3rd, as the stock started to bounce back up, 305,732 shares were outstanding as ""failed to deliver"" by the required settlement date (July 3rd). This is highly suggestive of aggressive, manipulative, and likely, naked shorting. Fails-to-deliver represent ""I Owe You's"" given by the broker. Essentially the brokers were selling the stock so aggressively, they were unable to provide the actual stock by the settlement date required by SEC rules. The buyer still gets shares in their account, but the broker is required to obtain the stock to cover their ""I Owe You"" later on. This successfully caused the stock to go down due to demand drying up, which then allowed brokers to acquire the stock at a lower price, thus settling their fail-to-deliver. **The decrease in share price would be their profit to keep.** The lower the sentiment for the company, and lower demand, the easier it is to manipulate the stock downwards via this method.

To counteract this, large buying volume is needed. Sector catalysts such as SAFE Banking Act, STATES Act, FDA rescheduling, or simply increasing revenues could be enough to reverse this action. I also expect this manipulation to ease off as Gotham Green has now secured a better deal and significantly lowered their average cost.

With MedMen having lots of access to cash, they can fund aggressive expansion into the most lucrative states. They are anticipating 10 additional dispensaries open in Florida by the end of 2019. Their acquisition of PharmaCann makes them well prepared for Illinois adult-use legalization on January 1, 2019.

With NY and NJ expecting to legalize within the next year, MedMen will be extremely well positioned. PharmaCann, will provide MedMen with double the allowable number of dispensaries in New York if approved by the state. MedMen is a strong lobby group for NY Governor Cuomo, so I am hopeful. The PharmaCann deal is expected to receive Department of Justice and state approvals around Fall 2019.

**Side note:** [This article](https://potstockz.com/pharmacann-breakdown/) explains how the PharmaCann acquisition amounts to a value of 25% of fully diluted MedMen upon deal closure. The poor stock performance will therefore equate to a lower $ price tag on the PharmaCann acquisition, which was regarded an amazing deal at the time of the acquisition- $682M USD. At today's MedMen share prices, they are only paying \~$225M USD for PharmaCann. Deal provisions do not allow either side to back out due to share price fluctuations.

**Branding &amp; Retail Domination**

Aside from my points above, MedMen seems to be the only company building an attractive, and recognizable brand  and retail experience. Last year, [MedMen outperformed Apple, Tiffany, and Starbucks](https://www.profitconfidential.com/stock/medmen-stock/pot-company-outperforms-one-metric/) in sales per square foot. Since these numbers were reached, they hired  [Apple Retail's former CFO](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181206005222/en/MedMen-Appoints-Veteran-Retail-Finance-Executive-Chief), Michael Kramer who is a retail expansion genius and the company is targeting a store average of  [$20 million in revenue in mature markets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-tmt-h-v-045914299.html).

|MedMen Stores|$6,188|
|Apple Stores|$5,546|
|Tiffany &amp; Co. Stores|$2,951|
|Starbucks Stores|$1,339|

**Revenues**

In April, MedMen announced pro-forma revenue of **$57 million USD**. Analysts are expecting Canopy Growth to announce revenue of **\~$86 million USD**. MedMen's fully diluted market cap is \~$920M USD compared to Canopy's fully diluted market cap of \~$17.8B USD as of Friday's close.

**Long and Strong**

The stock chart may look like shit but I'm buying at these levels due to the reasons mentioned above. My timeline is 1-3 years on this play. US legalization hype should give us a good pump around election time as well.  Until then, not having federal legalization provides MedMen with less competition and more ability to gain market share and brand awareness in this restrictive, and license capped environment.

Reasons to be positive:,"1. China isn’t so much aggressively devaluing its currency as it’s giving in to market forces (the CNY would likely be much weaker vs. the USD if it were to trade fully and freely).

2. The 9/1 China tariffs can still be avoided – Trump didn’t condemn the entire trade negotiation process in his 9/1 tariff threat but instead took issue w/the perceived lack of Chinese action on the issues of agricultural purchases and fentanyl exports, suggesting the bar for another G20-like truth may be relatively low.

3. Trump has had some (small) trade successes, including USMCA (although this probably won’t pass Congress before the Nov 2020 election) along w/bilateral deals w/South Korea and (possibly as soon as Sept) Japan

4. Monetary policy is easing globally – while restrictive monetary policy isn’t really a problem for the economy (as real rates globally are at or below zero already), stocks do respond (if only briefly) to easing (and the anticipation of further accommodation). Thus the approaching monetary events/meetings could serve as catalysts for stocks(FOMC minutes 8/21, ECB minutes 8/22, Jackson Hole speeches 8/23, ECB meeting 9/12, and FOMC meeting 9/18) and help put a floor in the SPX around ~2850

5. Global growth is holding up better-than-feared – the economy has been buffeted by a slew of headwinds and shocks but growth in aggregate is doing decently all things considered. Europe remains an area of softness but China’s most recent data (for June) signaled stability while the US consumer is doing very well

6. The CQ2 earnings season wound up being better than feared – part of this was a function of very subdued expectations but regardless the season was generally a healthy one (although the 2020 consensus estimate never moved higher).",WSBConsensus,1565556297,53,43,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp23y7/reasons_to_be_positive/
Is this too fucking retarded??,"Let me explain my analysis.

 I have relatives in Argentina and I am informed on the current political movements.

Argentina currently holds 61% of the international monetary fund, (more than 55 billion dollars). The government has done nothing than burn that loan by artificially decreasing the parity between the Argentinian peso and the dollar.

The thing is that today, elections are being held. The result of this preliminary elections would likely decide the outcome of the next presidential elections that will happen in October. The catch is that a political party which probably is gonna win (much of that uncertainty is gonna be prooved tonight, but they have way higher possibilities) had already publicly declared that they are going to default on the international monetary fund loan, therefore, sending the country risk assessment to the fucking clouds. 

My previous post searched for a sort of index that could directly track a country risk assessment since there isn't anyone, the most logical approach would be to short credit default swaps commonly known as (CDS) or to short the government bonds itself. 

Now the problems with this approach are 2. The first one is that cds are only available to institutional investors and hedge funds and the requirements to short one are fucking gigantic. The second problem is that despite is almost a fact the government will default on the loan from the international monetary fund. I find it hard to believe that they would do the same on bonds since the bonds are in local currency, now when they default on the IMF and it will happen, they will pay the local bonds however the amount of inflation that it would generate is going to be higher than 75% the first year according to my calculations.

&amp;#x200B;

So the action plan i am going to take is to short ETFs that primarily hold bonds in USD from the government as well as a couple of national banks. IF you wanna know the specifics DM me.

ACAD Acadia Pharmaceuticals Thesis,"ACAD note

Price: $29.80

Shares: 144.5m

Market Cap: $4.4bn

They have $382m of cash, at their annualized burn rate of $120m/yr, they have about 3 years worth of cash left before they need to raise more money. They SHOULD be able to reach profitability before that happens. But who really knows?

Acadia Pharmaceuticals has essentially one drug, Pimavanserin (also called Nuplazid), that is focused on CNS disorders. Their one drug, Pimavanserin, is already approved by the FDA to treat Parkinson’s Disease Psychosis (PDP). They are also in several clinical trials for other indications, such as Dementia Related Psychosis (a big one), Major Depressive Disorder as an adjunct therapy, and Schizophrenia negative symptoms. 

Pimavanserin works by targeting the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor in the brain, thought to be responsible for causing hallucinations. PDP by itself is a relatively large market, with 400,000 Parkinson’s patients in the US showing symptoms of hallucinations or delusions. In my discussions with neurologists and doctors, it came to light that almost half of PDP sufferers are not treated for their hallucinations because the side-effects from existing antipsychotic drugs, such as Seroquel and Clozapine, are so severe. These patients often see deceased relatives or pets in their homes, but are told that because they are not “disruptive” hallucinations, they are better left unchecked because the existing antipsychotics (NOT Pimavanserin/Nuplazid) will leave them feeling sluggish, drugged, cognitively impaired, and carry with them a higher mortality rate. Pima/Nuplazid has a relatively clean side effect profile and is safer than existing antipsychotics on the market, leading to almost no loss of cognition. It does carry with it a black box warning on a higher mortality rate, but having seen the data set, the patients in the trial were incredibly old, and oftentimes had severe cases of PDP. The doctors I have spoken with view Nuplazid as a safer drug than Seroquel and Clozapine and many are moving it up the chain of treatment options, even using it as a first line treatment in some cases of PDP. 

Market opportunity in PDP: Domestically, about 125k patients in the US are treated for PDP with mostly Seroquel or Clozapine per year. As I mentioned before, the true number would be significantly higher (400k) if all cases of Hallucinations with Parkinson’s were treated. I believe with a clean safety profile from Nuplazid that will eventually be the case. At 125k patients, the US market size is roughly $3.75b, but could be as high as $12bn if we are talking about the 400k patients. That market probably increases by about 50% if you include international markets, of which ACAD still retains all commercial rights. 

In the meantime, ACAD has upcoming trial data in the second half of 2019. The most important of these trials is Dementia Related Psychosis (DRP). 8 million patients in the US suffer from dementia and 2.4m also suffer from psychosis. The likely addressable market is 1.2m patients in the US every year and there is no approved treatment for this indication. Like PDP, desperate neurologists and doctors prescribe dangerous antipsychotic medications like Clozapine and Seroquel OFF-LABEL to treat these patients who are having disruptive hallucinations. That is arguably a $40b market if just half of the patients with psychosis were treated with Nuplazid. The interim data for their Phase III trial will come out in the second half of 2019, with final results coming in 2H2020. But the interim data will be enough to make or break the stock, likely. The trial is set up in an interesting (and in my opinion, advantageous way) for ACAD. It is a relapse prevention study, which means that they dose DRP patients with Nuplazid or Placebo for a few weeks (I believe 6?). They then take JUST the Nuplazid positive responders and take away their medication and track the rate at which the patients previously on Nuplazid relapse back to having hallucinations vs. the patients on placebo having their placebo taken away. Personally, I think this is a good trial design because it means you are only tracking the patients that actually were affected by Nuplazid, thus it should provide an advantage over placebo response rates. 

They also have a Phase II trial for Schizophrenia negative symptoms ongoing which should read out around the end of 2019.  40-50% of schizophrenia patients experience serious negative symptoms, leading to an addressable market in the US of about 1m patients. Their phase II ENHANCE trial just read out for Schizophrenia as an adjunctive treatment option (on top of other antipsychotics). Although it didn’t read out as statistically significant against placebo when used in conjunction with other medications, it DID read out as statistically significant on the negative symptom subscale in that trial (p value of 0.0474) so the stock has since recovered and more since the read-out of the ENHANCE results on July 23rd. 

They also are trialing the drug in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as an adjunctive treatment option. This market is likely 2.5m people in the US, but the trial just started in 2Q19 so we likely won’t get interim data until next year. 

On their 2Q19 call they raised full year revenue guidance to $320-330m, so the stock is trading at 12x this year sales, rich for a biotech company, but in my opinion likely severely undervaluing future opportunities from ongoing clinical trials, 2 of which have data readouts in the next 4 months. The Baker Brothers own 27.5% of the outstanding shares, which likely gives some people comfort considering they are some of the best biotech investors in the world. However, they have been wrong in the past. With the dearth of organic growth on major drug companies’ pipelines, I think EVENTUALLY this will be an acquisition target. It makes too much sense to buy an approved drug for an unmet need and just layer it in to a large drug company’s sales &amp; marketing staff as opposed to having to run your own sales force (as ACAD currently does) and have them only sell 1 drug. An acquiring company could literally just fire the entire sales staff and save themselves $315m a year by just adding it to the menu of drugs that their existing sales force sells…

EXTREMELY back of the envelope math on what I believe ACAD is worth if they get approvals: If you assume their existing markets are $50bn, and they capture 10% share, ($5 billion in revenue) and give it a 5x revenue multiple- much more reasonable for a biotech company, the stock price would be $172/share. So I guess that is what I am aiming for? But personally I own $45 calls that expire in 2020 after we should get the read-outs of DRP and Schizophrenia negative symptoms trials in end of 2019.

This is not a recommendation to do ANYTHING and if you blindly listen to me without doing your own due diligence you are likely going to lose money.

S3's pre-earnings update: "" [$OSTK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24OSTK&amp;src=cashtag_click) short int is $381 mm; 17.23 mm shs shorted; 60.81% of float; 61.86% borrow fee. Shs shorted are up +4.8 mm,+38.4%, in 2019; +637k, +3.84%, over the last 30 days; but down -618k, -3.46%, over the last week. There has been some covering ahead of the [#Overstock](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overstock?src=hashtag_click)'s earnings. ""

Obviously OSTK hit it out of the park on earnings and is near $25, but there was some covering before earnings, so we need to wait and see what the current short interest/borrow fee levels are next week.

We'll have to see how the short interest and numbers look in the days ahead post-earnings bump. Might be best to just keep it in mind and follow the short interest/borrow fee levels. If the shorts cover too quickly and borrow fees come down fast, there won't be much of a squeeze here.

&amp;#x200B;

The squeeze scenario probably requires short interest to stay over 50% and borrow fees stay over 50% which would lead algs/longs to try to force this to mid-30s or higher.  My advice is to let the IV come down and see if there's some calm before another potential leg up develops.

Note that in 2017 when it mooned, OSTK was just following BTC due to crypto announcements they made. There might be some of that kind of effect at play too given their blockchain work with tZero; so crypto rocketing due to currency war probably helps this thesis.",zg44,1565376047,4,12,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co6l58/overstock_ostk_possible_short_squeeze_in_play/

Boeing manipulating wikipedia articles to make it appear that their aircraft is more efficient than Airbus,"Check this out.

Under the history tab it lists aircraft by fuel economy. If you sort by fuel per seat descending Boeing aircraft consistently shows up at the top even though it’s aircraft are typically inferior in fuel efficiency to airbus. Looks like Boeing programmers have been getting creative again.....im looking at the source code to see how they did it. Appears to be they changed the distance divider from 500 that everyone else uses to 660 to guarantee they will show up at the top of the most fuel efficient. When will Boeing and their MAX line of aircraft stop defrauding consumers?

* **Age of the company, small detail, but an important one,** [Why it matters](https://imgur.com/a/x7NEeW2)

This company has been around for 25 years or someshit. That means these guys are done fucking around. They have made mistakes in their past with shitty acquisitions, and they are done with that bullshit. Kinda like you and me, we've dated some [bitches](https://media.giphy.com/media/bjvEB94sMn2Qo/giphy.gif), and we've learned not to do that anymore. They have experience of that pain, which is a strength in management. Management is also at that retirement age, they're in their peak, they meet deadlines, control costs, and are looking for that fat ass retirement. Plus inside ownership is one of the highest for KGC in the gold mining industry.

* **Gold Reserves (Gold in the dirt, yet to be mined.)** [Gold Reserves](https://imgur.com/a/40nneEo)

Truly one of the most important measurements, if not the only measurement you should have for a gold miner. 

25.5 million oz of gold equals 38.2 billion dollars right now. LIT    

1500 gold oz means KGC makes 500 dollars per ounce profit. Which means KGC has 12 billion dollars of profit under some dirt right fucking now. You could buy KGC for 6 billion dollars...[HELLO](https://gph.is/2HE5OdA)!?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Endgame** [15 year chart](https://imgur.com/a/f7T32xS) 

KGC will be bought out, and I believe they are positioning themselves just for that. This goes back to the age thing, management is at retirement age, they are looking to cash out. So that means they will be wearing their best dress, performance is at a very high level, so even if they don't get an offer, the company continues to do well on their earnings. I honestly believe negotiations are already underway, as this company has fantastic mines with gold reserves. Not many gold companies have penetrated the Russian market, this is kinda the clutch geolocation real estate, this is the real estate that makes KGC different.

But the price target is completely feasible. 

In this current environment, it would be impossible for KGC to stay below this price target. I follow the chart on this stock everyday, and there's no fuckin dip. In my opinion, this stock is actively being accumulated, as if the buyout is already underway. GDX and GDXJ have negative days, not this fuckin stock. 

Positive, day after fuckin day. I look at the other miners everyday, FSM, GOLD, FNV, they have some decent dips, they will be negative, not KGC. Somethings in the works for this bitch.

It is starting to become obvious, watch it for the next couple days, you'll see its suspicious.

HPE is fucking worthless,"Alright peoples, since everyone is looking downwards, here's a company that is absolutely going to get CRUSHED. 

\-First, HPE essentially sells servers, with a good part of its revenue coming from it. With the trade war, components are becoming more expensive. But, they have to deal with all other competitors both Chinese (Lenovo, Huawei, ZTE) and American (Cisco, IBM, etc). Additionally, the refresh cycle for servers themselves have changed. Clients are either not buying them as frequently, or moving completely towards the cloud (AMZN, MSFT Azure, etc). So essentially market forces are biting HPE's sausage from three ends. 

\-Second, HPE is pursuing a refresh in its strategy that is very risky. They are spending on trying to diversify (Aruba networking and Cray supercomputing), which unfortunately costs a boatload of money. They've been trying to buy other companies too when valuation has been incredibly high, especially in tech. How are they funding it? Debt. Due to the market forces above of refresh cycles slowing down and people going towards shared resources/cloud, the revenue gain from these new companies will still be very slow. 

\-Second-and-a-half. HPE recently introduced their new Greenlake strategy which is essentially leasing their equipment to you as a subscription. Leasing is nothing new, but in the tech world, companies either pay and completely own, or they use a cloud service. If you want to own, you would own (something cheaper, like from IBM) and maintain everything in-house. If you want hands off, you would go into the cloud. This strategy is the worst of both parts - having to maintain something you don't really own, and still have the risk of things going offline and having almost no support. 

\-Third, HPE is essentially leveraged to the hilt already. No one wants to buy HPE stock and they can't really issue more without severely diluting, which is the reason why its capital infusion strategy in the past years has been debt driven, pumped by the cheap interest rates. 

So, revenue is dropping from the cycle change. Costs are increasing due to its expansion strategy. Money will become harder and harder to get. The only thing they do have are patents (but fuck it, China can just copy them). Instead of shorting TSLA or whatever popular stock, take a look at this shitty company that used to be a part of another shitty company which made shitty printers.",1poundbookingfee,1565317716,8,15,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnvzpv/hpe_is_fucking_worthless/

$ATVI DD,"Alright so I know this is Reddit and ""grrrr Activision bad, CD Projekt Red gud"" but hear me out for a second.

In 2014 World of Warcraft eclipsed 100 million lifetime players. Obviously that total number has gone up since then, but for sake of discussion lets go with the hypothetical scenario of 100 million dormant players, we'll write off any additional subscriber gains since 2014 as the currently actively playerbase(napkin math for sure, but I gotta catch a flight soon so whatever).

WoW Classic is coming out soon and I think we are about to see something spectacular.

Lets say of this 100 million, 10% of those players decide to take a romp down memory lane and pick up a 3 month subscription. Furthermore, they need buy the current iteration of the game for it to work, and lets say for the heck of it maybe 25% of those players decide to actually try it out. Furthermore lets say 10% of those players that are playing the latest game decided to stick with it for bit, and pick up a character boost of their favorite class. Afterall, a lot of these people that used to play have will have more money than time, so paying $60 to not do a shit sucking grind is a bargain at that point.

Lets break it down line by line:

* 3 month subscription = 10,000,000 x \~$40 = $400,000,000
* WoW BFA purchase(required for classic) = 10,000,000 x $50 = $500,000,000
* Hypothetical character boosts = 250,000 x $60 = $15,000,000

So assuming a 10% reactivation rate we are looking at about $915,000,000 before tax and I dunno wtf their effective tax rate is so we'll say like $700,000,000. This is all for this quarter, from just from WoW, from reactivated players alone. Now I know there are a lot of other ways WoW milks their customers, but for simplicities sake I am going to ignore them for now any move on to my next point.

We now have a large influx of players re-engaging with blizzards platform. For funsies if 25% of them pick up another blizzard game at some point this quarter that will be another roughly $250,000,000 in $ATVI's pocket.

My expectations are this quarters earnings will match expectations or maybe even a moderate beat(starting to see players reactivate as the classic hype builds).

# However I think there is going to be a BIG DICK GUIDANCE INCREASE.

If you've played earnings before, at this point you should know guidance is basically all that fucking matters.

"Why ROKU is a $1,000 stock","Let's just be clear I have been pumping this stock since the $30s. I say ""no short ROKU"" like Trump says ""no collusion."" After that MONSTER QUARTER, it's time for another round of PUMP IT PUMP IT PUMP IT UP.

30 million accounts watching 3.5 hours of TV per day... this is like 210 million accounts with FB-level engagement. OK? BIG engagement. And growing. Owning the customer relationship to the TV, what could possibly be more valuable than this? Not even Facebook have this. Not even Google or Apple have something this powerful. (To be clear, this is a forward looking statement. I disclaim all obligations to update forward looking statements under the safe harbor provison yada yada yada)

ROKU demolishing competition in terms of devices sold and streaming viewing hours... oh, you thought Amazon Fire would crush ROKU? Smart thought, but now that this did not happen and will not happen(refer to ROKU shareholder letter, other sources showing increasingly growing lead, please talk to boomer suburban white ladies over cup of chamomile), perception of value should go way fucking up.

By the way management is just top notch... They have the interest of customer and content provider in mind, and strategic placement as well. Mr. Wood genuinely is a top-tier CEO.

#International

Anthony Wood was very coy on the call when asked about interntational. I love this coyness and it only makes me hard. ROKU has big plans for international, it is a vast opportunity. Refer to NFLX stock performance since entering the international market. There is no reason why ROKU will not own this market too.

Look guys, this stock is at its most undervalued so far. While it is at highest price so far, the biggest barrier to a $1,000 stock price, fears of competition, should be essentially removed at this point.

I hope you salty shits have Uber puts,"TL;DR before you get wrapped up in it all, this is mostly speculative with just a couple numbers &amp; news events, no deep profound trader shit. Fuck you and your mother. 

The only ride share company on this earth with a large enough market share to put uber out of business? Lyft. No other correct answer. And they just posted smash earnings. Shitty by most other standards (-$0.68 vs -$1.39) but give em a gold star for the fuck of it. 

Somehow, some way, some autists out there see uber’s largest competitor doing good and say “well shit, put it all on uber”.

They’re trading at $42.52 as i type this. They previously were $39.28 this time yesterday.

Gonna take a gamble on $ATVI earnings,"$ATVI is expected to announce EPS of $0.26

I’m going to gamble on them having a post ER pop because they’ve gotten their users themselves to gamble. If you aren’t a CoD player search on r/blackops4 the terms ‘Peacekeeper’ and ‘S6 Stingray’ and you’ll see what has happened the past quarter.

Treyarch/Activision added two DLC weapons (Peacekeeper &amp; Stingray) that users could buy. 

Except they can’t just buy it. They have to gamble and buy CoD points to buy crates that gives 3 items and hope that one of those is the gun. The chance of getting one is probably 1-3%.

I really believe a large portion of players spent $100-200 or even more on CoD points. Why? The weapons were severely OP (overpowered for y’all that don’t play) and gave an enormous advantage to someone who had them rather than the original guns at the initial release.

They turned a $60 game that released in October into an online casino. And you know damn well all the 12 year olds that play it were swiping their parents credit cards.

The stock is down ~30% from a year ago and since Activision hasn’t had a game released in quite a while so expectations should be low, creating value.

They could even beat Q1-2019’s EPS because they didn’t have downloadable content and OP weapons then like they did in Q2.",birkswithsocks,1565267149,36,46,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnl18q/gonna_take_a_gamble_on_atvi_earnings/

TEVA to the MOON after earnings,"Bull Case:

This article about a proposed 10 billion $ settlement came out today and it tanked the sector, Here’s some names you might have heard:

ENDP down 21%
MNK down 12%
TEVA down 9.8%
MYL down 5.9%

Note: MYL just had the PFE deal so its down less,TEVA didn’t get cut down as much as others considering.

Now, if you’re on this board you should read it [1]. In it you’ll notice a couple of things:

The companies mentioned in the $10 billion settlement? Not TEVA, if fact, I can’t even find TEVA mentioned in the article. Another fact, TEVA had 0.9% of the market share [2] yet TEVA got smacked today. TEVA got smacked last month and the month prior and the month prior (on and on). BUY WHEN THERE IS BLOOD IN THE STREETS LIKE TODAY. Honestly TEVA is undervalued in the sector and in the market as a whole. Management hasn’t been talking about lawsuits for two reasons, one of which is painfully obvious:

1) they are focusing on the COMPANY, developing products (look out for Epi Pen Jr in earnings call) to pay down the debt. That should be obvious, they aren’t lawyers, they are hyper focused individuals who were brought in to reshape a failing organization, and they are stabilizing it in a solid, systematic manner.

2) management doesn’t feel the NEED to speak up, they didn’t have a big roll at all in this, hence why they aren’t actually mentioned in these recent articles. Sure Actavis is mentioned, but the weren’t acquired until AFTER the time frame of the lawsuits in question. TEVA lawyers will deal with it so management can focus.

Things to watch out for in earnings:
- Epi Pen Jr.
- Debt Payments
- Positive Lawsuit Liability Dialogue

TEVA is so beaten down and has such value behind it, they have plenty of potential catalysts for tomorrow and, depending on how good it is, has potential to squeeze to 9-12+ very soon.

"Monday Earnings Play, Bring Money"," 

Alright you guys want some DD, some guaranteed income, some calls to buy, and for me to spoon feed you what you want? Let's do this.

Today we're looking at the company Digital Turbine (APPS).

How they looking the last week? Up 8.1%

How they looking the three months? Up 42.5%

How about the last year? Up 281.28%

This company is a juggernaut and I love their vision.

You must think to yourself, ”But wait, sure the price must be too high for me to buy now?"" 

Nope. The current price sits at $5.64. But let’s examine some options.

If we load up on the $5 strike price for 8/16 ($0.68), I’m anticipating a +10% move after earnings and this should get you around 50% profit for every dollar you spend.

Personally, I like the 9/20 expiration at the $5 strike. It’s only $0.88 with better liquidity and better bid/ask.

The profitability will be less on a big jump following earnings but it will also give this time to run a little. And, in the off chance the the stock price dips or remains flat, you will have plenty of time to hold and watch it gain traction.

What do they do?

“Today's app discovery ecosystem is broken. Digital Turbine's mobile delivery platform makes it easier than ever for people to discover new apps, for operators and OEMs to build new revenue streams, and for advertisers to reach users at scale.”

This is the truth. When’s the last time you went into the app store and found a cool game or other app? Almost all the cool apps I’ve found are through word of mouth or through some other round about way.

This company is a 2-way street. There’s millions of consumers out there looking for cool new applications for their phone. There’s so many new companies looking to get their apps into the hands of their target audience and this company is here to bridge a much needed gap.

This company boasts 1,579,307,295 Sponsored app installs on over 160 million devices.

Is this a sure fire bet? Just as sure as I was diagnosed with Aspergers. I’m a tip-toe walking, obsessive, socially unaware, dude unable to detect irony.

A little Tax Clarification With Capital Gains &amp; Losses,"I saw some confusion in the comments of a few posts about the issue of how exactly capital losses offset gains and found this blurb that clarifies things pretty well.

### Capital Losses Can Be Carried Over Indefinitely 

Let's assume the stock market has a bad year. You sell a stock or mutual fund and realize a $20,000 loss. You have no capital gains that year. First, you use $3,000 of the loss to offset ordinary income. The remaining $17,000 will carry over to the next year. Next year, if you have $5,000 of capital gain, you can use $5,000 of your remaining loss carryover to offset this gain, $3,000 to deduct against ordinary income, and the remaining $9,000 will then carry forward to the next tax year. If you had no realized capital gains for the following 3 years, the remaining $9,000 tax loss would be used up, $3,000 at a time, over those 3 years.",akamaterasu,1564800578,7,13,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cldott/a_little_tax_clarification_with_capital_gains/

BYND updated borrow costs from S3,"From S3: BYND short int is $1.02 billion; 5.25 million shares shorted; 44.59% of float; 126% borrow fee on existing shorts but new small borrows going at 250% to 475% fee, We saw 41k of net short selling yesterday as [\#BeyondMeat](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BeyondMeat?src=hashtag_click)'s stock price fell -12.32%. Secondary hasn't happened yet,

&amp;#x200B;

Here is their article from yesterday discussing the secondary and why they think a short squeeze is still on deck:

[https://shortsight.com/beyond-meat-shorts-up-170-million-on-secondary-offering-news-2/](https://shortsight.com/beyond-meat-shorts-up-170-million-on-secondary-offering-news-2/)

Beyond Meat Inc (BYND) reported mixed 2nd Quarter results with earnings of -$0.24/share, missing expectations, but Sales of $67.3 million beating expectations. The biggest news on the call was the announcement of a secondary offering of 3 million shares from existing investors and 250 thousand shares from the company. BYND investors will be able to cash in on the company’s nearly fourfold rise in its stock price ahead of their November lockup period expiration and Beyond Meat Inc. will be able to raise cash for operational purposes.

BYND short interest is $1.16 billion; 5.21 million shares shorted; 44.45% of its float; 138% borrow fee on existing shorts and new stock borrows are going between 160% to 240% fee.

BYND short selling has been hampered by lack of stock borrow supply since the end of May. While short selling has increased slightly since the beginning of June, an increase of 55 thousand shares +1.07%, we have seen 179 thousand shares covered, -3.33%, over the last week. Most of the short selling has been forced due to a slew of stock loan recalls hitting the street over the last two weeks, but there has also been voluntary short covering due to the high cost of borrow eating into trader’s alpha and the nearly $1 billion of mark-to-market losses incurred by short sellers since BYND’s IPO.

BYND short sellers were down $970 million in mark-to-market losses since its IPO, and down $441 million in July. BYND’s stock price was down significantly in after-market trading after the secondary offering news and the price weakness carried through to today’s market open. BYND is down -14.5% in early morning trading and shorts have recouped $167 million in mark-to-market profits in less than 15 minutes of trading. Shorts are now down “only” -$803 million in mark-to-market year-to-date losses and down -$185 million in month-to-date losses.

A BYND short squeeze is still looming on the horizon, shorts are paying over $4.4 million in daily stock borrow financing costs; stock borrow rates continue getting more expensive; stock loan recalls keep hitting the streets; there is virtually no stock borrow supply left on the street to cover those recalls; and shorts are still down a significant amount of mark-to-market losses even with today’s price drop.

BYND is still a Tesla-like lifestyle based long stock holding and therefore we are less likely to see long shareholder capitulation on price pullbacks which would shift BYND’s price momentum downward. A rebound rally back to its yearly highs will probably shake out some more short sellers who caught a temporary respite from seemingly daily losses and provide some buy-side pressure. If BYND’s stock price rebounds it will force some short covering as shorts realize some of today’s profits before they disappear into thin air. If long shareholders decide to buy on the dip and build their positions at today’s “cheap” prices, short sellers may decide to cut their losses and buy back shares now and possibly wait until the 3.25 million share secondary offering hits the tape to re-establish their positions.

There are many reasons for an impending BYND short squeeze, but only a complete 180 degree change in long shareholder sentiment will save BYND short sellers’ year-to-date P\\L. If today’s price weakness doesn’t hold, look for long buying coupled with short covering driving BYND’s stock price back to its recent lofty heights.

Me again- I think the earnings' figures were pretty spectacular. They didn't miss EPS when you exclude the warrant revaluation from having the stock go from $25 to $200, but that doesn't matter since the stock is down. Obviously revenue and guidance blew the roof off both estimates. I'm curious how this will trade after the secondary prices tonight. Will borrow costs come down below 100%? If so, its probably dead in the water. However, if it doesn't, shorts are sitting on high borrow costs while they wait 3 months for 3Q earnings. I am trapped in $300calls for August 16th that are super out of the money. There isn't enough volume to sell them if I wanted, so I have no choice but to be long here :) I sold a small bit of my position on Monday before earnings (the post was taken down due to downvotes? Good system we have here at WSB). So I am sitting on a 30x bagger that I've cashed out. But I am definitely hoping I can recoup something for the massive amount of calls that are presently almost worthless.",MikeThePutz,1564590813,10,39,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckatkv/bynd_updated_borrow_costs_from_s3/
$GSK is printing money (?),"I've been following $GSK for a while now and seeing that pharma isn't big over here, apart from shkreli, I'll assume little know what GSK is. In short, they're the sixth largest pharma with a mkt cap in excess of $200bn, they released earnings two days ago and and beat on EPS ($0.14) and on revenue ($322m) and the stock peaked at $42.18 that day.

Anyways, enough with the boring shit. You might ask, how is it printing money? The stock barely fucking moves, it keeps playing between \~$39.5 to $41.5 and I've got reason to belive it'll stay in that range for a while. Two brief points worth noting:

&amp;#x200B;

* **The whole brexit fuckery**: the company is based in the UK and thus reports earnings in pounds which took a huge shit a couple days back and all translates to uncertainty for an investor, at least a US investor that is. And it is apparently a huge deal as dividends declared back on home soil remain higher (historically) than those declared in the US and why is that?  gbp/usd value over time.
* **They're pretty solid and growing:** a while back they were discussing a joint venture with pfitzer, their biopharma department is a cash cow even with it's \~3% market share and their pipeline is pretty crouded and currently has their HIV treatment awaiting registration with numerous others you can check [here](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/research-and-development/our-pipeline/).

Given a different time, the stock wouldn't be as undervalued as it is right now but brexit is taking such a toll on them, and that's where you autists can make up some of your losses that you've YOLO'd on BYND. 

Their average volume is close to \~$2.2m shares a day, plenty liquid out there for you and IV is pretty fucking low, we're talking sub 16% here and options are pretty cheap too, just check for yourself.

Either I'm missing something here or this seems like a great oppertunity to buy some butterflies/condors on.",CharbelU,1564581032,22,12,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ck8rfe/gsk_is_printing_money/

WMB - Williams Companies NESE pipeline,"Has anyone else been following the NESE pipeline saga in NY/NJ area? Basically Williams Companies has been pushing to build the NESE pipeline (24 miles of NG pipeline to feed MH, Queens, Long Island areas). The pipeline would be located in both NJ and NY and the proposal is being pummeled by environmental groups. The permit in each state has been rejected and the DEP has also rejected the proposal over the past few months. Both governors are fairly progressive and also trying to build their following within their party. This year is an election year for some of Cuomo's buddies so the thinking is that this will be held up indefinitely until possibly after the 2020 elections.

I work around the construction industry and have heard many stories of projects being fully re-designed to eliminate the need for natural gas. This is affecting projects all through LI and Manhattan but will come into play in a major way at the 2 airports - JFK/LGA and their upcoming developments. From what I have heard from people close to the situation is that there will be no approval for a long time if ever. National Grid has advised no new gas accounts unless the pipeline is approved. There will be immense pressure on the states to approve, but I also get the feeling that Cuomo will dig his heels in to keep his status in the progressive/green new deal world.

On top of this, in last quarters earnings release, WMB stated that they expect the permit to be approved and for the construction to start in fall 2019. They also raised their net income and earnings guidance on that call and specifically called out their Northeast region as the fast growing portion of the company. 

Their shares have been dropping this week but the next earnings release is on 7/31 after hours and I have a feeling a major outlook revision may be brought up.

S3's Short Squeeze Report on BYND from yesterday,"I am just seeing it today. Amazingly, they are confirming that this move up hasn't technically been a short squeeze! Worth a read. 

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of May, BYND shares shorted hit the 5.4 million share level and much like its retail burger patties, supply started to dry up. Since May 31st, shares shorted have only increased by 11 thousand shares, +0.20%, but stock borrow rates have increased by 80%. With virtually no stock borrow availability left, short sellers have not been able to build their positions, but existing stock borrow costs continue to climb and take large bites out of their potential net alpha.

Surprisingly, with stock borrow rates consistently over 100% fee since June, and BYND’s stock price up over 105% we have not seen a mass exodus on the short side. BYND shorts\\longs, are becoming more cultish and similar to TSLA shorts\\longs and hold strong convictions on both sides of the supermarket aisle. As you can see in the charts, neither stock price or borrow rate increases have pushed shorts out of their positions.

Short sellers are facing the specter of a short squeeze from three different sides. BYND’s post-IPO rally is causing mark-to-market losses which are getting harder and harder to digest. High stock borrow fees due to an exhausted stock borrow supply has tacked on $164 million in financing costs, which has dramatically decreases net of financing expected Alpha. And finally, stock recalls have been hitting the street in size for over a week. While Prime Brokers have been working furiously to protect their clients form the bulk of the recalls, there are very few rocks to look under for replacement stock borrows and short sellers will feel the full brunt of the new recalls over the next few weeks.

If BYND’s stock price continues to soar, stock borrow rates continue to increase, and recalls keep hitting the street we will see an epic BYND short squeeze in the very near future.

BYND Borrow Rate and SI,"From calling around, I am getting borrow rates in the 150% range. S3 hasn't released their borrow rate or Short Interest information yet. However, last night S3 said that the short interest in BYND has remained stable since the beginning of the week. Ergo, this hasn't technically been a short squeeze yet. The reason I put so much faith in their data is because they apparently scrape their data from many large fund managers and see in relatively real-time what short positions and borrow rates are for thousands of large money managers with hundreds of billions of dollars of assets. TLDR: I trust their data. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, BYND's valuation is INSANE at this moment and is being driven by share fundamentals, NOT business fundamentals. We are much [closer to the top](https://imgur.com/fibpp3r) than we are to the bottom and I will look to be selling within the next few weeks. I will make a post on WSB when I do sell, but please know that I CANNOT PICK A TOP and it is better to sell early and lock in gains than to risk the money you have made to eke out a small incremental profit. At this point, BYND is running on pure emotion and 99% of people trading it will get burned.

Create Your Own Option Database,"Disclaimer: Lot of fucking words

I have been working on creating a python app to store Options Data for my own use over the past couple of weeks and figured that I would share it to this sub. I will say I am nowhere near finished, but the basics of the app are up and running. That being said, **there is zero error handling**, if you fuck up and put something like 200 in for the ticker the app will crash.

The app is called OptionDB and the idea is that with it you can create and maintain your own options database filled with historical data to back test strategies or create 3D surface plots like this: [https://imgur.com/a/NXqi2NM](https://imgur.com/a/NXqi2NM). This is the 3D volatility surface for MSFT calls yesterday. I should say upfront that besides the 3D plotting, the app only works to store and maintain the data, **it is pretty much up to the user as to how they want to use it**. I have my own custom scripts for my own analysis, say tracking the net delta exposure on all QQQ calls/puts, may add this in latter.

I bundled the app along with all the packages into a .exe file but I recognize the downloading a exe from a unverified publisher is sketchy so I will detail two different ways you can set it up.

1. If you want to use the executable it is fairly simple, but you **must have a Windows system**. Download the executable from this dropbox link: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bh6hqq4p6ttnr91/MainWindow.exe?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bh6hqq4p6ttnr91/MainWindow.exe?dl=0).  After that, move the executable to to the folder of your choice. Then in your C drive create a folder named OptionDB. This will be the directory for the database files so the path must be **C:/OptionDB**. 

2. If you want to build it from the source or just view the code, the GitHub is: [https://github.com/Nathan-T1/OptionDB](https://github.com/Nathan-T1/OptionDB). I will not go into detail as to how to set it up python as I assume if you go this route you have some level of python knowledge. Just make sure to build the directory exactly as seen in the repository, add paths to the Data and UI folder, and create the folder for the database as mentioned above.

Now all you need is a Tradier API key, which can be obtained by signing up here: [https://developer.tradier.com/user/sign\_up](https://developer.tradier.com/user/sign_up). I am not affiliated with them in any way, just a good free options API that I like. After making an account request your free API Key.

Now you can open the executable or run the app you built from my source. When your open the app for the first time you will need to do complete 3 things. One, press the Generate DB button on the left side. Next press the Generate Archive. Finally press the API key button and enter your key in.

Now you are ready to use it. The rest of this post will be detailing how to use it and what all the buttons do.

To start off, press Update DB. This is the main functionality of the app and will be run frequently. Your first time opening it, you will need to add the tickers you wish to store data on then press add after each one. The more you do, the longer it will take to pull and more storage it will take. 

After you have your list, you can press the Update Database button. Only press this button once per day after 5 pm eastern or you will create duplicates in your database. Depending on how many tickers you store, this can take around 5 minutes. Now you can export your data into a csv by pressing the Export Day button or Export Custom. These functions will export a csv to wherever the exe is located based on what you fill in. 

If you just want a quick one day pull you can press the Single pull button. Enter the ticker and destination, **do not press SQL** if you have already updated your database for the day. Custom pull is self-explanatory, don’t list strikes if you have more than one ticker.

For Export Custom, **always put 0 in for days**, haven’t added the custom functionality for this yet. Otherwise Self-explanatory.

To create a 3D mesh, press Create Mesh. You can only create mesh if you have the data in your database. The possible targets you can use are **last, ask, bid, volume, weighted\_volume, IV**. Will add more latter. Check Export mesh if you want it to export the grid as a csv. Note the IV solver is not perfect, but you can export it as a mesh and work with it your self if you get a weird surface.

That is pretty much it. The rest is up to you. If you want **my historical data the dropbox is**: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ma4369ld27wwew6/MAIN.db?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ma4369ld27wwew6/MAIN.db?dl=0). I accidentally overwrote most of my data two weeks ago, so most if it got deleted. Also, the dates for the SPY table are fucked up, haven’t had time to change it so only query from the last two days for SPY. 

If you use my data base, place it in the folder I mentioned above, but **do not press the Generate DB button** inside the app when you first start the app, but you will need to press the API key.  

I have gotten the executable to work on two different systems, but I am guessing there will be problems. Let me know if there are any questions. If you plan on using this a lot or want to see the data, I highly recommend downloading DB Browser from [https://sqlitebrowser.org/](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).  You can edit and update data and execute SQL queries if you know that shit. 

If your app keeps crashing, run it from the command line and it will display some form of error, maybe I can help fix it.",Nathan-T1,1564098752,46,37,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chvgtw/create_your_own_option_database/

**Today’s Bullish Activity**

Some notable upside earnings movers include:

* **Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW + $23.03 to $218.50):** The medical device maker reported Q2 adjusted earnings of $1.38 per share ($0.05 beat) on revenue that rose 15.2% year-over-year to $1.09B (above the $1.04B expected). Looking ahead, the company said it expects Q3 EPS to come in a range of $1.13-1.23 (below the $1.25 consensus estimate) on revenue of $1.02-1.06B (above the $1.01B consensus estimate) while raising full-year 2019 guidance as EPS is now expected to come in a range of $5.20-5.40 (from $5.10-5.35) and revenue is now expected to be $4.0-4.3B (from $3.9-4.1B). Calls are outnumbering puts nearly 3:1 with the August 16th 200.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 512).
* **Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG + $37.40 to $777.00):** The burrito chain reported Q2 earnings of $3.99 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.23 beat) on revenue that increased 13.2% year-over-year to $1.43B (above the $1.41B expected) as comparable same-store sales increased 10.0% (above the +8.3% expected). Digital sales grew 99.1% year-over-year and accounted for 18.2% of sales for the quarter. For 2019, the company said it now expects comparable restaurant sales growth to be in the “high single digits” from a prior view of mid to high single digits. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the July 26th 790.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 1,620).
* **Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN + $8.74 to $128.81):** The chip company reported Q2 earnings of $1.29 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.07 beat) on revenue that declined 8.7% year-over-year to $3.67B (above the $3.60B expected). In terms of guidance, the company said it expects Q3 EPS to come in a range of $1.31-1.53 on revenue of $3.65-3.95B versus the respective $1.38 and $3.84B consensus estimates. Calls are slightly outnumbering puts with the July 26th 125.00 call garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 2,644).
* **Snap Inc. (SNAP + $2.32 to $17.15):** The social media messaging app reported a Q2 loss of $0.06 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.04 beat) on revenue that increased 48.0% year-over-year to $388.02M (above the $358.16M analysts had expected) as adjusted EBITDA came in at ($78.7M) for the quarter, better than guidance of ($150-125M). Daily active users were 203M versus the 192M analysts had expected. Looking ahead, the company said it expects Q3 revenue to come in a range of $410-435M (above the $400.23M expected) and adjusted EBITDA to come in a range of ($85-60M), better than the ($96M) estimate. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:3 with the July 26th 17.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 25,910).  

New 52-week highs (107 new highs today): **Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT + $0.90 to $51.93), Cummins Inc. (CMI + $1.54 to $174.91), Delta Airlines Inc. (DAL + $0.23 to $62.92), Teradyne Inc. (TER + $8.81 to $56.90)**

**Notable Call Activity**

**FireEye Inc. (FEYE + $0.26 to $15.65):** Calls are outpacing puts roughly 7:1 as option traders primarily target the July 26th 15.50 call. Volume on this contract is 15,037 versus open interest of 539, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought at the ask prices of $0.16 and $0.17, which suggests bullish intent. Note: FEYE is scheduled to report Q2 earnings on July 30th after the market close.

**Micron Technology Inc. (MU + $0.77 to $47.72):** Calls are outpacing puts roughly 3:1 as the top seven most actively traded contracts are all calls. The most actively traded contract is the August 2nd 50.00 call (volume is 30,091 vs. open interest of 1,443) which mostly consisted of a 20,000 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.70. We know the block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

**Mylan N.V. (MYL + $0.45 to $18.80):** Calls are outpacing puts better than 5:1 which is mostly due to activity on the August 2nd 21.00 call. Volume on this contract is 7,447 (vs. open interest of 4,112), which mostly consisted of a 5,243 block that was bought for $0.60 when the bid/ask spread was $0.33 x $0.70 (suggesting bullish intent). Note: MYL is scheduled to report Q2 earnings on August 7th before the market open so the positioning on this contract does not include the potential impact of that event.",Seffie9000,1563996601,24,5,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chcrmh/todays_options_market_72419/

BYND working on faux bacon. Sorry for the multiple posts today!,"Easy to layer this into Dunkin's and Tim Horton's menus. (breakfast sandwiches). Again, sorry for posting so much about this stock! But the news is coming out fast and furious. 

&amp;#x200B;

From Bloomberg: 

With burgers and sausages under its belt, [Beyond Meat Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BYND:US) is now creating a plant-based alternative for the carnivore breakfast staple: bacon.

The company doesn’t have a launch date, but Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said in an interview that the product is improving as it goes through development.

The company, which has seen its [stock](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BYND:US) soar almost 700% since its initial public offering in May, is rapidly expanding its reach. Its plant-based burgers, faux ground beef and sausages are sold in more than 30,000 supermarkets, restaurants and other venues around the world.

Bacon would follow the company’s recent focus on breakfast: Doughnut shop Tim Hortons serves Beyond Meat’s sausages on breakfast sandwiches in almost 4,000 locations. Beyond Meat also announced a breakfast sandwich partnership with [Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DNKN:US) on Wednesday.

Conversations with potential customers for the bacon are already underway.

“We’re looking forward to trying their bacon whenever we can,” said Emily Murphy, director of specialty procurement at Baldor Foods, a produce-focused distributor with centers in New York, Boston and Washington. “We understand from Beyond that it’s in the works.”",MikeThePutz,1563988014,46,69,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chawwa/bynd_working_on_faux_bacon_sorry_for_the_multiple/

"Dunkin' Adding BYND Sausage to their menu, starting in NY","Dunkin has 10,858 total location, with 7,677 of those in the US. This is a huge win for BYND. 

From CNBC: 

[Dunkin’](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=DNKN) is adding [Beyond Meat](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BYND) to its menu, as the plant-based meat trend continues to gather steam.

The coffee chain is offering a breakfast sandwich made with Beyond Sausage, starting with locations in Manhattan. The company plans to roll out the menu option nationwide in the future.

Shares of Beyond jumped 3% in premarket trading Wednesday, while Dunkin’s stock rose 2%.

Dunkin’ is the first U.S. restaurant chain to add Beyond Sausage to its menu. Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons, which is owned by [Restaurant Brands International](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=QSR-CA), recently rolled out breakfast sandwiches made with the plant-based meat substitute. It also added its first ever burger — the Beyond Burger — to its menu.

Consumer demand for more vegan and vegetarian options has been driving restaurants to add products from Beyond and its competitor Impossible Foods, although some like [McDonald’s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MCD) and Chick-fil-A are sitting out for now.

The NPD Group found that 18% of Americans are trying to reduce their meat intake. The U.S. market for meat substitutes reached $1.44 billion in 2018, according to Euromonitor data. Beyond’s market share is only about 2%.

**Today’s Bullish Activity**

Some notable upside earnings movers include:

* **Coca-Cola Company (KO + $2.15 to $53.37):** The beverage company reported Q2 earnings of $0.63 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.02 beat) on revenue that rose 6.1% year-over-year to $10.00B (above the $9.86B expected) as organic revenue (non-GAAP) grew 6%. Comparable operating margin was 30.3% versus 30.6% in the prior year. The company reaffirmed full-year 2019 EPS growth of -1.0% to +1.0% while raising organic revenue growth to +5% from +4%. Shares of KO are trading at all-time highs this morning. Calls are outnumbering puts better than 4:1 with the August 16th 55.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 1,058).
* **Hasbro Inc. (HAS + $7.80 to $116.31):** The toy maker reported Q2 earnings of $0.78 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.28 beat) on revenue that increased 8.9% year-over-year to $984.54M (above the $958.91M expected). The company is attributing the robust results to strong demand for “Avengers: Endgame” toys. Shares of HAS notched a fresh all-time high of $119.72 earlier in the trading session. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 5:4 but the August 2nd 114.00 call is the most actively traded contract (volume is 853).
* **Polaris Industries Inc. (PII + $4.02 to $86.65):** The maker of power sports vehicles reported Q2 earnings of $1.73 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.08 beat) on revenue that rose 18.4% year-over-year to $1.78B (above the $1.77B expected). Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis declined 104 basis points year-over-year due to tariff costs and (lower gross profit margin) boats, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Looking ahead, the company said it expects full-year 2019 EPS to come in a range of $6.10-6.30 on revenue of \~$6.81-6.87B versus the respective $6.06 and $6.78B consensus estimates. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the August 16th 95.00 put garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 353).
* **Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc. (SWK + $9.51 to $151.01):** The home improvement tools maker reported Q2 earnings of $2.66 per share ($0.11 beat) on revenue that increased 3.2% year-over-year to $3.76B (below the $3.81B analysts had expected) as gross margins declined 80 basis points year-over-year to 34.8%. The company reaffirmed full-year 2019 EPS guidance of $8.50-8.70 (vs. the $8.63 consensus estimate) and said it expects free cash-flow conversion of approximately 85-90%. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with the August 16th 152.50 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 112).  

New 52-week highs (77 new highs today): **Analog Devices Inc. (ADI + $1.63 to $119.34), Haemonetics Corp. (HAE + $0.37 to $122.80), KLA-Tencor Corp. (KLAC + $1.50 to $138.65), Kansas City Southern Inc. (KSU - $1.22 to $124.12)**

**Notable Call Activity**

Online pet store **Chewy Inc. (CHWY - $0.51 to $29.70)** is trading at a post-IPO low this morning but some unusual call activity is coming up on the radar. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 12:1 which is primarily being driven by two 8K blocks that simultaneously traded earlier this morning:

* An 8K block was sold on the October 18th 30.00 call for $2.90 (open interest is 8,375)
* An 8K block was bought on the October 18th 25.00 call at the ask price of $6.00 (open interest is 43)

Based on the open interest figures it appears that a previously held long 8K call position was rolled down from the 30.00 to the 25.00 strike price, which suggests that the block trader is still bullish on this name but perhaps not *as* bullish as when the position was established. Chewy Inc. began trading as a public company on June 14th and the stock has traded in a range of $29.03-$41.34 since then.  

**Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL + $1.16 to $62.90):** Calls are outpacing puts better than 5:1 as the top eight most actively traded contracts are all calls. The most actively traded contract is the August 16th 62.50 call (volume is 6,275 vs. open interest of 2,133) which mostly consisted of a 4,936 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.90 (suggesting bullish intent).

**Today’s Bearish Activity** 

Multiple stocks are moving lower this morning following quarterly results:

* **Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS - $1.22 to $71.44):** The chip-design software company reported Q2 earnings of $0.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.04 beat) on revenue that increased 12% year-over-year to $580.42M (slightly above the $579.41M expected). In terms of guidance, the company said that Q3 EPS is expected to be $0.50-0.52 on revenue of $570-580M (vs. the respective $0.50 and $576.12M consensus estimates) while full-year 2019 EPS is expected to come in a range of $2.11-2.17 on revenue of $2.315-2.335B (vs. the respective $2.09 and $2.32B consensus estimates). Calls are outnumbering puts nearly 2:1 with the August 16th 75.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 511).
* **Centene Corp. (CNC - $0.78 to $51.41):** The U.S. health insurer reported Q2 earnings of $1.34 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.10 beat) on revenue that increased 29.4% year-over-year to $18.36B (above the $18.02B analysts had expected) as managed care memberships increased 2.2M (or +17%) to 15.0M. The company raised guidance as full-year 2019 EPS is now expected to come in a range of $4.29-4.49 on revenue of $73.6-74.2B (from prior respective views of $4.24-4.44 and $72.8-73.6B). Calls are outnumbering puts 5:3 with the August 16th 52.50 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 280).
* **Whirlpool Corp. (WHR - $9.99 to $138.36):** The appliance maker reported Q2 earnings of $4.01 per share ($0.29 beat) on revenue that rose 1.2% year-over-year to $5.2B (above the $5.03B expected). Ongoing EBIT was $363M (or 7.0% of sales) vs. $343M (or 6.7% of sales) in the year-ago quarter. The company raised full-year 2019 EPS to a range of $14.75-15.50 (from a prior view of $14.05-15.05) and said that it expects to generate cash provided by operating activities of \~$1.4B and free cash flow of \~$800M. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 5:4 but the August 2nd152.50 call is topping the most actives list (volume is 113).

New 52-week lows (147 new lows today): **Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY - $0.05 to $42.72), Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ICPT + $0.42 to $67.47), Kroger Company (KR + $0.09 to $20.95)**

**Notable Put Activity**

Some unusual put activity (\~33:1 over calls) is being seen in **Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM + $0.25 to $40.63)** which is mostly due to activity on the August 2nd40.00 put. Volume on this contract is 12,062 versus open interest of 66, so it’s likely that this is all new positioning. The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought for between $0.60 and $0.63 each, which suggests bearish intent. The positioning comes ahead of the company’s Q2 earnings release which is scheduled to be released before the market open on August 1st.

Also seeing some heavy put activity (\~4:1 over calls) is **Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TEVA + $0.11 to $7.80)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 20th6.00 put. Volume on this contract is 42,761 versus open interest of 17,157, so we know that this volume primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the volume consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought at various ask prices, including a 7,092 block that was bought for $0.52 when the bid/ask spread was $0.50 x $0.53 which suggests bearish intent.

**Volume Signals** 

**Adient PLC (ADNT + $1.66 to $23.37):** Today’s option volume on this car seat maker is 48,403 versus average full-day volume of only 189 contracts which is primarily being driven by three large blocks that simultaneously traded on the September 20th expiration earlier this morning:

* 27.00 call: an 18K block traded for $0.76 when the bid/ask spread was $0.85 x $1.00 (open interest is 0)
* 23.00 call: an 12K block traded for $2.35 when the bid/ask spread was $2.35 x $2.55 (open interest is 0)
* 19.00 put: an 18K block traded for $0.85 when the bid/ask spread was $0.80 x $0.95 (open interest is 10)

We know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures but beyond that it’s difficult, if not impossible, to determine what kind of three-legged combo position the block trader established here. ADNT is scheduled to report Q3 earnings before the market open on August 6th so this positioning captures the potential impact of that event.   

**Omnicell Inc. (OMCL + $1.11 to $69.47):** Option volume is running at over 11x the daily average of 148 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of mid-sized blocks that simultaneously traded on the August 16th expiration:

* A 750 block was bought on the 65.00 put for $2.20 (open interest is 48)
* A 750 block was sold on the 60.00 put for $0.95 (open interest is 57)

We know these blocks are new positions and it appears that a $5.00-wide bear put spread was established for a net debit of $1.25 (x 750 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes that OMCL will close below the break-even price of $63.75 at expiration. The positioning comes ahead of the company’s Q2 earnings report which is scheduled to be released after the market close on Thursday (July 25th).

**Range Resources Corp. (RRC + $0.07 to $5.53):** A 8,650 block was bought on the January 2020 6.00 call at the ask price of $0.80 (open interest is 14,346). It’s likely that this block is a new position given the expiration date but we can’t be sure given the open interest figure.",Seffie9000,1563917459,105,25,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cgyt44/todays_options_market_72319/
BYND Daily Borrow Rate update,"I know this will seem hard to believe, but so far this bump up in BYND has not technically been a short squeeze. The short borrow rates that I have found are about 143%, flat from yesterday and the end of last week. S3 also confirms that short interest has only moved a little and short borrow rates are not changed that much. From S3: ""BYND short int is $1.006 bn; 5.18 mm shs shorted; 44.23% of float; 132% stock borrow fee on existing shorts &amp; 147% fee on new borrows.""

&amp;#x200B;

Ergo, a short squeeze still might be on the table. It is probably not the LIKELIEST outcome, but it is possible. Typically with a short squeeze we would see short interest fall 10-20% on an absolute basis. (so short interest decrease from 44% to 34%, for example). Also, for those of us who think this could be another TLRY, Tilray's short borrow rate topped out at a daily rate of 900%, with a gradual increase over the proceeding days/weeks. So we are still not there yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still am holding my August 16th $200calls. I rolled over all of my $100c and $140's in $200 calls. I also took my initial investment off the table so I am only playing with profit and hence have a bigger risk tolerance than I otherwise would have.

$69K Bet on Microcap Stonk - $CREX,"  

I love FDs and Monthlies as much as the next guy. I played $DIS for 400% a few months ago and recently $MSFT was good to me. There used to be a lot of bad decisions around microcaps and precilinical biotechs on this sub. I miss them. I have been jonesing for some “back to our roots” WSB posts.  So I decided to make one.

Here is my $69,000 YOLO on a high volatility, low volume microcap - $CREX. The volume is so low that it took me a few days to accumulate without screwing the entry price. Check out the chart with arbitrary doodle lines on it and pretend future forecasts. The only time this stock has decent volume is PR or ER.

Please note, you will see a big dip Sept through Nov of 2018 when you review the yearly chart. During this time, the company acquired another strategic business (allure Global), uplisted to NASDAQ from OTC, and closed a $10M public offering.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I think $CREX it is worth a look –** 

The stock has beautiful, high volume surges with PRs (earnings). These have consistently broken $3.50 the last 3 times.

The company is becoming profitable and making huge (100% YoY) revenue gains and should really be worth $3-$5 within the next few months. It is winning industry awards and getting industry recognition as one of the best digital ads companies (digital signage and high-end kiosks mostly)

· Q1 2019 revenue up 133% YoY to $9.5M

· High growth in core business

· Gross profit $3.7M , up 144% YoY

· Achieved operating breakeven Q1 2019 with a $0.4 EBITDA

· \~$40M + revenue in 2019 expected from less than half that in 2018.

You know how all the betas are whining about service jobs being replaced by kiosks and software? Well, that’s one of the things this company does. It’s the wave of the future until retinal implants and AR.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why you should stay away –** 

It’s a low volume, high volatility microcap that you need to keep long or exit within 1-2 days of catalyst (either you watch the stock or set good alerts- both volume and price with contingent logic would be wise). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Give it a look.** 

Might be worth your tendies. Might get a captain’s hat out of it.

I think this is an undervalued stock that will at least repeat previous spikes on earnings but may go quite a bit higher with some volume and attention. I made some decent profits the last 2 earnings and wanted to share while the price was still low. Expect ER in about 3 weeks.

WAG reward is 50-125%

NASDAQ: ATVI (World of Warcraft and friends)

The world's most successful MMO, currently sporting ~ 2 Million Active subscribers all paying 15$/month. Blizzard being a part of Activision has sunk quite low in recent years, dwindling subscription numbers are a part of that problem along with a whole host of other issues at blizzard but none of those fucking matter because...

On August 27, Blizzard will be launching the long awaited Classic WoW server, this will be a remake of the game in it's original 2004 state.

To this you might scoff and say ""Remakes are released every year 647, who cares it's just another cash grab."" or ""There have been private servers out forever who the fuck is gonna play that?""

The normies don't run that private server shit.

Mark my words this will be the single largest revenue producing remake that we will have seen to date. To give you some context when Runescape released it's Old school server the active subscription number shot up and there are more people paying for and playing OSRS than the modern RS3.

Activision is going to zoom past 50 even if everyone unsubscribed after a month the initial hype will do what apex legends did to blizzards stock,, let's get them tendies.

Stocks to keep in mind for bulls and bears - 7/22-7/29 trading week,"**THIS IS A REVISED POST FROM THE ONE I POSTED ON FRIDAY. I've added a few recommendations for earnings after spending most of Friday and Saturday doing DD for next week.**

&amp;#x200B;

Hey y'all! As usual, been swamped with work and research.  Stock picks for last week (and the week before!) were absolute fire. Let's keep it rollin'.  I've received tons of private messages asking for advise, justifications for stock picks, etc. I will try to get to you as soon as I can, but I'm generally much better at replying to the post directly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I usually post (about 20-25) stock picks in the Daily Discussion thread but I do so at very odd hours (usually late at night and on weekends) as I'm swamped with work at more regular hours. My stock recommendations usually rely on in-depth TA and FA, which take some time. I will try posting in the front page more often in the hopes of more tists getting a chance to see the DD. And I will continue with the tradition of posting results for the sake of accountability.

&amp;#x200B;

As usual, I'll recommend puts and calls, and given the positive feedback and success from this weeks' earnings plays, I've devoted some extra time into DD for earnings next week.   


*FOR THE BULLS:*

* Calls: $**TWLO,** $**VRTU**, $**EBAY**, $**COF**, $**FDX**, $**XLNX**, $**OKTA**, $**LULU**, should print good tendies
* BULLISH POWER PLAYS\*\*: $**UBER**, $**SQ**, $**TRIP, $CRWD, $FVRR**
   * If you get CRWD calls, wait for a day or two - at least wait til market close on Monday. The stock will likely pull back some, but after that it will continue its voyage to the moon

*FOR THE BEARS:*

* For the bears: $**MTCH**, $**IBKR**, $**GRUB**, $**SKX**, $**AMBA**
* BEARISH POWER PLAY\*\*:  $**BIDU,** (buy late Monday or Tuesday), **$CMG** (sell before earnings for safe play, sell after earnings if you want to yolo NFLX style); **$HSY** (sell before earnings)

*EARNINGS*:

* EARNINGS CALLS: $**BIIB; $GOOGL; $PYPL;** $**FB** (easy peasy, though I would buy on Tuesday at market open); 
* EARNINGS PUTS: $**HLT;** $**BA** (don't buy tomorrow. Buy right before earnings), 

*For the broke breddas:*

* Penny stock of the week: $**OTLK**

THOTie Tendies (RVLV DD),"Im super long on Revolve Group to the tune of $9k in options and shares.

Why? Not pure autism. 

Read the prospectus. It will get you hard. 

They've cracked the millennial/gen Z marketing code and the numbers speak for themselves. Using Social Media influencers and data driven marketing strategies they've been profitable for 15 out of their 16 year operating history. 

Let's start with basics: WTF is revolve group? Group of 3 brands selling variety of clothing and accessories to mainly young professional women. Three brands each have different price points. There's a higher end brand, a  more ""standard"" brand and a more ""cost effective"" brand. They sell their shit online using HEAVY Social Media marketing strategies with thousands of influencers on their payroll. 

Do yourself a favor right now. Check out Revolve's Instagram page. The pictures speak for themselves. They look fucking good. Now for comparison, check out a more traditional retailers Instagram page. Victoria's Secret is a good example. There is a NIGHT and DAY difference between the quality of posts between RVLV and Victoria's secret. The pictures on Revolve's page have professional lighting, professional editing, they look amazing. Vicky's posts look like trash in comparison. There's several ""mirror selfies"" on there. It's fucking pathetic. 

When your target demographic spends the whole day on Instagram, you better be damn sure your insta post looks fucking good. This is why $LB is down 20% over the past year and RVLV is up. 


The numbers: revolve has already proven itself. Over the past 3 years, they've shown growth in margins (gross margins 53%), growth in revenues (21% growth in net sales year on year q1 2019), and massive growth in profits (512% growth in profits since 2017). Read the prospectus yourself if you don't believe me. 

This trend is only the beginning. 

Social Media influencers can drive tens of thousands of people to a shitty fake music festival in the Bahamas (see Netflix documentary FYRE fraud). When you harness this power and combine it with an actual GOOD product that customers actually like (and they do like this shit! 89% net sales retention year on year!) the results will be nothing short of phenomenal.


RVLV has dipped recently with the broader market and i am buying this dip. Y'all do what you want. But I will say that I have a pretty good track record on WSB (go through my post history, undefeated).

Can PayPal Continue the Win Streak in Q2,"Can PayPal Continue Win Streak When It Reports Q2 Earnings?
Danny Vena July 20, 2019
PYPL$ 118.63 -$ 1.24 (-1.0%) 
When PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) reported first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimates and better-than-expected earnings per share three months ago, the stock climbed 3% on the day after its report. But that rise was just one step in PayPal's relentless 2019 climb. Overall, the stock is up roughly 41% so far this year.
On Wednesday, the payment processing specialist will be back in the news with its Q2 financial report. For PayPal investors, the focus will be on whether the company can maintain this strong momentum. Here are three metrics stock watchers will be paying particular attention to when earnings are released after the closing bell.

1. Revenue growth
PayPal's revenue rose 12% year over year in Q1, though that number was adversely affected by the sale of its portfolio of consumer receivables to Synchrony Financial. Adjusting for that one-time event, revenue increased by 19%.
For Q2, PayPal has guided for its solid growth to continue, with revenue expected to increase by 11% to 13% year over year, or by 12% to 13% after excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
From the perspective of Wall Street, analysts' consensus estimate calls for revenue of $4.33 billion, up about 12% year over year, which is at the midpoint of management's guidance.
2. Earnings per share
During Q1, PayPal reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.78, easily surpassing the $0.68 high end of management's guidance, which also matched analysts' consensus estimates.
PayPal explained that $0.08 per share of that result derived from its recent equity investment in MercadoLibre. PayPal announced in March that it had laid out $750 million to tap the ongoing adoption of e-commerce and fintech in Latin America, and had been impressed by the company's management.
In a recent regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, PayPal said it expected to report a pre-tax gain of $218 million from its strategic investments, which is expected to result in a benefit of about $0.14 per share in Q2. 
PayPal had previously guided for adjusted EPS in a range of $0.68 to $0.70 per share. Wall Street clearly believed that management is being too conservative in its forecast, with expectations for EPS of $0.71.
3. A growing and highly engaged user base
PayPal has been able to consistently put up strong revenue and earnings numbers because of its ability to expand its user base and to increase the engagement of its existing users. The company added 9.3 million net new active accounts during Q1, bringing its total to 277 million, up 15% year over year. It expects to exceed 300 million active accounts by year's end. 
The number of transactions per active account, which is an indicator of engagement, grew to 38, up 9% compared to the prior-year quarter.
One of the highlights of its user base activity is the rapidly growing use of Venmo. While it began as a free person-to-person (P2P) payment app, it can now be used to pay merchants anywhere PayPal is accepted. The company recently revealed that Venmo has grown to more than 40 million active users, and those customers are driving significant increases in total payment volume, up 73% year over year in Q1. Venmo is on pace to process nearly $100 billion in transactions in 2019.
Watch for additional updates on PayPal's growing active user base.

Night Time DDs to Snack On,"  

I got 3 DDs for you. 1 I follow carefully and make 5% returns on avg over a week every time it hits a specific price point, which if you truly are an autist or a paranoid schizophrenic seeing this pattern should have been easy to spot, 1 that should never be this low so it happens like twice a year and will go up cause its cannabis and it’s not $NBEV, and lastly one you should watch because the company is gonna hit the ground running once it opens up trading again. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. $EA has been dipping down to 90 and up ever since it fell under 100 in April. If it's between 90-91 its time to make money because it recovers well. I have seen returns every time within a short time. Right now the gaming company, as are others, are in the midst of legal issues regarding loot boxes and EA also fell short on Apex for Season 2 from what we know. But holding the star wars license and seeing a release coming up, it will sell because its star wars. The stock dipped under 90 for the first time in a long time. Time for some tendies as this stock is going to recover as it has been.

&amp;#x200B;

2. $CGC should never be this low and with cannabis only moving more toward legalization this company will follow as it is one of the bigger cannabis companies that has been buying out smaller companies and aggressively expanding. $IIRP is a company that sells property to cannabis companies and it isn’t slowing down keep an eye out on companies like these. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. $ASNT If you got in last march before they shut down their stock trading you’re in the money but you will have your chance if you get in once it opens up. The company was in shambles and a small group started buying majority stock, overthrew the board and created their own with a solid group. They were able to keep their operating license in one state and are still cleaning up legal and financial issues after the last board basically put the company on life support but they’re pushing through the shit and giving weekly/biweekly reports of what they’re doing. One to watch for sure.

WFC DD is it going to pop??,"So I went in and today bought like 19 call contracts at different price points and expirations. The stock took a dumb after earning. When you look at the earnings etc you see its really doing quite well. I think its going to bounce back. It posted greater earnings, income and revenues. Plus they have been cutting costs. Now they did say they expected the rate cut to hurt them lower rates are bad for banks. But then they also went ahead and got a dividend bump too. I think tomorrow or by Friday my contracts are going to turn into some nice paydays. Or I will go ahead and blow away a few tendies on Wells. Thoughts ? Did you think the drop today was on point or what.

USO DD for week of 7/15/19 - 7/19/19,"Stand alone USO DD post this week for you autistic fucks! Was going to post sooner but was busy over the weekend/today, it actually worked out because I was able to get more info about the storm impact on oil in the gulf region. 

The pullback in oil is being attributed to the China economic data that was released today.
Industrial output and retail data beat expectations, but overall figures showed the country’s slowest quarterly economic growth in decade. The main argument about China's slowing economic growth is that it will impact oil demand, however, China’s oil consumption rose to 13.07 million b/d in June,  which is up 8% up from a year earlier. So overall I dont think Chinas demand for oil is being greatly affected (at least currently). I see today as a good dip buying opportunity, which leads me to my next point, Barry

So on the surface, one would expect oil prices to go up whenever we have a storm/hurricane impact in the gulf region, however, there is more than just production platforms that are affected during these storms. You also need to consider how it affects refineries in the area and the storms potential impact on refinery utilization rates. The higher the utilization rate, the more crude oil is converted into gas/distillates resulting in lower inventory levels. Many refineries in the Lousiana area consume anywhere from 100-550k barrels a day, that means that even if only a handful of these refineries were down, it could easily negate/cancel out production lost in the gulf (where only 17% of US oil comes from). Additionally, we need to consider how this affects export and imports coming into this region. Ultimately alot times you see an uptick in exports from oil companies rushing to get shipments out before storms and a decrease in imports from crude shipment delays So with that being said, let's look at some numbers.

The US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement  stated up to 73% of oil production or between 1.1 - 1.4 million b/d, has been impacted as of last Thursday, with 4% starting back up today.

ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge refinery, which processes 502K b/d, was completely unaffected by the storm and was operating normally as of Sunday evening. Their storage terminal in Sorennto, LA was also spared and still running, meaning oil exports here were likely minimally affected as well.

Phillips 66 closed its Alliance refinery Friday, which processes 290k b/d, and started operations back up today. 

PBF Energy's Chalmette refinery cut back (some not all) production as well, but largely due to a result of new crude deliveries being halted. I suspect more refiners delayed crude shipments as well and we'll likely see lower import numbers as a reflection of that in this weeks EIA report.

To simplify, Barry seemed to impact production and imports more than refinery utilization and exports and will likely lead to a draw in this weeks oil report.

Oil has overhead resistance on the monthly and weekly around $62-62.5x ( translates to roughly $12.8x USO), I dont see us breaking through this week but will be the target if EIA reports another draw. USO FD Calls either tomorrow or Wednesday before the report 

I will be updating this thread as info becomes available such as the API and EIA numbers

Bearish Case For $EA,"After the big gay dip in 2018, $EA has been a solid stock to long this year. It opened the year around $77 and touched $108. BUT $EA employees and investors got shitfaced on the 4th of July and anyone holding calls got cucked. I had a small position in puts that could have been 10 baggers but I sold on the 3rd before the fireworks.

On to the details... Fundamentally, I don't have much faith in $EA. Analysts are projecting low revenue and earnings growth in the future. $EA also doesn't have impressive EBIT/EBITDA margins. Some obvious problems are rising A/R, reduced plowback into investments, and falling FCFs. Without a solid earnings surprise, $EA won't last trading in the $90s.

The TA for $EA is also bearish. The stock has been trading in three notable channels this year. Key price levels are $91, $94, $99, and $103. These are all respective support and resistance levels for different time periods. Early this month, $EA tested the $103 resistance level and got rejected hard. $EA quickly tanked and tested the $91 support level to bounce up a bit. Short term, we can see $EA forming a rising wedge, which is bearish. I expect $EA to attempt an upward breakout this week, get rejected, and then test the $91 support level again. Other technical indicators are all pointing down. See charts below.

BYND is at Costco DD,"Costco is now carrying Beyond Burgers. I don't see this in any press releases by either Costco or BYND. There was a vegan blog that mentioned this information (it was brought to my attention by [**relevant\_pet\_bug**](https://www.reddit.com/user/relevant_pet_bug)) and I called the stores to confirm it. The item # is 1338620. It is in approximately 15 stores nationwide. A store in San Diego has it for sure, 2345 Fenton Parkway, and the Costco on 1890 S University Drive in Davie, Florida has it. I don't know the other 13 stores. When I called a purchasing manager in the regional area to find out why the stores only carried a limited supply of the Beyond Burgers, he said that Costco would buy as many Beyond Burgers as they could get their hands on, but that BYND only sold a limited amount because they couldn't keep up with demand. He said that Beyond Burgers are selling really well and they are selling out in ""just a few days"". Apparently, BYND will be installing new manufacturing lines by the end of 2018 to to increase supply and supposedly they will be able to provide Costco nationwide with Beyond Burgers by next year. 

I asked why Costco would sell Beyond Burgers when they already sell Morning Star and Don Lee Farm's Veggie Burgers and the purchasing manager said that Beyond Burgers just taste different and customers want them. AGAIN: This man is responsible for buying items for Costco in a large region of the US and he said that they would buy as many BYND Burgers as they could, but that supply was limited and that they will stock Beyond Burgers nationwide once BYND can meet demand in early 2019. This is hugely positive news and I don't see any news reports about it or analyst reports mentioning it (please let me know if I am wrong!)

Apple’s buying Intel (modems),"https://www.iam-media.com/defensive-aggregation/intel-pulls-patent-sale

A few months ago, [Apple was in talks to acquire Intel’s now-defunct modem division.](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/apple-is-in-talks-to-buy-intels-germany-based-modem-business-report-claims/) Weeks later, Intel put their IP up for auction (presumably to speed up talks with Apple). Today, news broke that Intel has entered an exclusive agreement with a buyer on their IP portfolio - my bet’s on Apple.

No way Apple can build their own modem in just six years (thanks to their deal with Qualcomm). Intel’s modem division alone is &gt;6000 people - just hiring 6000 people is going to take six years. Apple’s acquisition of Intel’s modem division would work perfectly for both companies. Intel’s 4G/5G development is based out of San Diego/Munich and Apple’s expanding their presence in both cities. The two companies have been working closely together on the past iPhones, and Intel is obligated to support both past and future iPhones. Apple knows if they don’t pick up Intel’s team, Intel’s whole division will fall apart and support for previous (and upcoming iPhones) will falter. It’s in the best interest of both companies for the deal to go through.

My bet is that news will break before Intel earnings on 7/25. Feel free to ask questions - [I’ve been following this closely for months](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bea18z/prediction_aapl_will_acquire_intcs_modem/).",unemployed_at_intc,1562772857,36,27,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cbi71n/apples_buying_intel_modems/
BYND Short Interest update,"I hope everyone had a great 4th of July break!

S3 is reporting that: ""BYND short interest is $885 mm; 5.61 mm shs shorted; 47.88% of float; 142% borrow fee &amp; new borrows at over 300% fee. There is very little left to borrow &amp; recalls are still hitting the street.""

&amp;#x200B;

In my calls to brokers I have found borrow rates creeping up from 106% on Friday, to 126% on Monday to 153% yesterday (with a range of 106-197% yesterday). I will update when I do my research calls today.

For those that didn't see my posts last week, I have basically taken my original cost basis off the table and am now just holding August $200 Calls. This is insanely risky, but I am playing with pure profits at this point. I still believe a short squeeze will happen, but we need to continue to see rising short borrow costs for that to happen.

So 3/5 correct I think that's pretty good given that this is my first week doing DD on this sub. u/SoRefreshing had about a 2/5 to 2.5/5 average of being correct so I guess what I'm trying to say is it literally can't go tits up. And by the way, shout out to all the people who called me retarded for being bullish in Disney because guess what I was right. And an even bigger shout out to the 90% of people on my original post who just commented about the disclaimer instead of about the actual DD.

BYND updated borrow rates,"S3 has taken a little bit of a hiatus from posting updated short interest and borrow rates on BYND so I haven't been posting every day, but I have been calling around to brokers that I know of to get their short borrow rates. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, the borrow rates I am seeing for BYND are about 106%, this was down from 116% yesterday and from 110% the day before. Fidelity, Schwab and a few others max out at 99% before charging higher rates to their institutional clients vs. their retail client base. That is data I don't have access to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last update we have from S3 (data analytics firm) is from July 1st and is that BYND has 5.44m shares shorted, about 46.4% of the float. Borrow rate they were seeing was 113% and rising. But that is a couple day old data.

Long Thesis: Global Blood Theraputics (GBT US),"Investment Thesis

Global Blood Therapeutics ([GBT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GBT)) recently reported top-line results of its Phase III HOPE U.S. clinical study of Voxelotor in patients with Sickle Cell Disease or SCD. Following the positive phase III HOPE study clinical trial results on June 14, 2019, the stock price surged over 10% over the next week. We believe that the company is well-positioned to receive the FDA approval for Voxelotor for the treatment of SCD with a potential annual peak revenue of over $2 billion by the patent expiration in 2032. The efficacy and safety profile of 1500mg Voxelotor during phase III study was very strong, especially when compared to the lower dose of 900mg Voxelotor, which was used in the phase II study. Consequently, we find as the key near-term bullish catalyst the potential positive FDA approval of the New Drug Application or NDA, which will be released most likely later in H2 2019. The FDA approval might lift the stock price close to the analysts’ consensus price target of $90.0 per share over the next 12 months. We find the biggest risk for shareholders an excessive share dilution as the company might issue even more additional shares over the next several quarters.

How to play July,"Disclaimer: this DD is not very autistic in the sense that it’s not much of an FD/gamble. But I’m seeing a lot of people that want to make smart plays and/or join theta gang, and I think we have here a fantastic opportunity to make an easy 10% in three weeks. So if you’re looking for that, here we go with a good starting point. Again, not autistic, but a good play. 

IF you believe the following three premises, then I think you can easily make 10% in just three weeks. 

1. Trump and Xi will not come to a trade agreement this month. 

2. Earnings will generally be muted at best, and most likely straight up disappointing. 

3. The Fed will not cut interest rates this month unless the economy tanks. 

The play: Sell solidly OTM call spreads on SPY. My personal favorite: 7/26 $302/$305 spreads.  I sold a bunch before close for $53/spread. The plan is to close for $23/spread for 10% gains ($30 on each $300 of collateral). 

Discussion:

1. Trump and Xi will not come to an agreement this month. We have yet to see anything from China that indicates they are willing to give ground on the fundamental issues. Meanwhile Trump keeps emphasizing that any deal must favor the US. China has made moves to become less reliant on the US in anticipation of extended tariffs. This recent truce involved no actual progress on key disagreements. Perhaps a deal is made eventually, but not soon. 

2. Earnings start ramping up this month. Most companies are toning down guidance and reporting that performance will decline year over year due to the effects of tariffs and slowed production. With no end in sight of the substantial tariffs, guidance will be low and expectations will be tempered. We aren’t going to see the types of earnings beats that cause stocks to push past ATHs. In addition, more and more articles will come out highlighting these facts over the next few weeks. 

3.  The Fed will not cut rates this month. The economy is still healthy. It’s not booming in the same way that it has been, but the primary goals of the fed are under control. Despite more dovish language at their last meeting, the Fed is still in a “wait and see” attitude about rate cuts and does not want to pull the trigger prematurely. If really bad economic data comes out, they could lower rates. But their dot plot actually shows very minor rate cuts before more rate hikes in the coming years. It would take a harsh economic downturn to force their hand (which would likely be fine for this play as well). If the economy tanks, selling calls is a good play. 

Therefore, I see no catalysts that can push us higher than the $297 area we could not push through on this weekend’s news. The market might not go down, because Trump is a master at propping it up, but there is no real reason to push through and blast through ATH without one of the three fundamental issues above changing. 

So enter the spreads and relax for a month of slow burn gains- if you want to join theta gang or bear gang, this is your invitation.",originalmuggins,1562018938,15,23,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c80wca/how_to_play_july/

**TL/DL Buy coffee futures. If you can't, Buy JO**. If you only want to bet on cold, buy  near by expiring options on JO even though they are hilariously low volume. Do this because 1) it might be cold in Brazil and 2) Coffee is 'due' for a bounce back.

$SPX- ***EXTREMELY BULLISH*** 

I am very confident that we will see an immediate rally at open, and then have it level out throughout the day/week because orange man said “trade talks with China are going very well” at G20. I’m planning to buy a bunch of calls at open and then possibly selling by noon depending on how well they perform. 

&amp;#x200B;

$BYND- ***BULLISH***

Many of you autists are familiar with this one. I bought some $152.5 ITM calls for no real reason other than them being cheap on Friday as the stock dropped 1.27%. Obviously, I’m bullish only for the short term, They’re way to overbought. It’s pretty ridiculous for a fake meat company. I’m definitely gonna sell on Monday if I see any kind of profit (something not too common here), as I don't foresee a big rise this week. 

&amp;#x200B;

$REAL- ***BULLISH***

The stock jumped a whopping 44% the day it IPOed (Friday). Most people predicted this because of the founders previous IPO history. By the time we actually can trade options on this stock, I could turn bearish if the stock becomes too overbought, but for at least the next week, I'm bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

$AAPL- ***BEARISH*** 

My position on Apple is obviously mostly due to Jony Ive leaving the company and them moving production of the Mac Pro to out of the US. I currently have $2.5k in 210 ITM puts expiring on the 5th. I don't expect a big crash or anything so if I see some gains by mid-week or even mid-Monday I'm probably going to take it and run. At this point, the only reason I can think of for a possible rise in Apple stock would be due to the trade talks with China, as the tariffs would heavily affect Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

$DIS- ***BULLISH***

The stock peaked this week at $141.18. I expect it to go down to at least $138 by mid-week mostly due to Toy Story 4 not doing as well as predicted. I currently have $7k in 135 ITM calls. I hope to sell on Wednesday’s open.

&amp;#x200B;

$UBER- ***BEARISH*** 

The stock went up 2.77% just Friday. The stock is too overpriced, and the company is way too overvalued for a company that for whatever reason doesn't seem to have a path to profitability. Overall, I’m bearish on this stock for both the short term and the long term.

What does Dish network want with $40B of 5G spectrum?,"Dish has been struggling for awhile now with declining TV subscribers and an abysmal streaming platform that has only 2.4 million subscribers.  Meanwhile, over the last 11 years, the company has been slowly accruing a treasure trove of expensive wireless spectrum that it isn't using.

According to the company's [May 03 10-Q filing](https://dish.gcs-web.com/static-files/f03c25b6-0f91-4d9d-bc4c-f60ae0d1bcd6), the company has spent $11B over the last decade acquiring wireless spectrum licenses, and a further $10B in licenses bought through ""non-controlling investments"".

Due to the US government's push to roll out 5G, the FCC has imposed build-out requirements on spectrum distributed in the 700MHz band.  Spectrum is broken up into chunks which are auctioned to wireless companies under the expectation that these companies invest the money required to actually build out a network in this bandwidth.

In 2012, after two small satellite phone companies went bankrupt, Dish purchased their assets.  These assets included a chunk of spectrum that the US Government had given the companies for free in an effort to grow the satellite phone market.  DISH lobbied the government to expand this spectrum to allow for terrestrial use, under the agreement that it would begin rolling out its own network as a competitor to the major telecommunications providers.

In 2015, a DISH subsidiary made a $10B ""non-controlling"" investment in Northstar Spectrum and SNR Wireless.  Both companies bid at an FCC auction for AWS-3 spectrum and received a $3B (25%) discount due to their size, with the obligation that both companies meet the build-out requirements.  After the FCC uncovered that these companies were tied to DISH, the companies had $3B of spectrum (equivalent to their discount) revoked and DISH was forced to pay a $515M fine.  DISH is actively [appealing this decision](https://www.fiercewireless.com/iot/dish-works-to-rescue-3-3b-spectrum-discount-aws-3-licenses) back at the FCC to try and prove that it never controlled these entities in an attempt to try and win back their revoked spectrum.

The FCC granted DISH all of these licenses to use spectrum with the expectation that DISH build out massive mobile broadband. So far, DISH has come up short on these build-out requirements, leading to speculation that is sitting on these bands, hoping to resell it when 5G bandwidth gets hot.  Due to its failure to meet recent critical deadlines, its 700E and AWS-4 bandwidth deadlines were moved forward by one year, requiring 70% coverage in their respective areas by March 7, 2020.  Its 10MHz build-out deadline was moved up to April of 2022.

In response, the company says it plans to spend $1B to build out a 5G network ""focused on supporting narrowband Internet of Things"", of which the first phase is anticipated to be completed in March 2020.  However, they initially promised that this spectrum would be used for mobile broadband. DISH claims they plan to upgrade the network to support broadband another 2 years later in 2022, or 13 years after they first started buying this bandwidth.  A failure to meet these deadlines will result in the revocation of licenses, depending on the extent at which the network was built.  If DISH only builds out 10% of the network, the FCC may revoke its license in the other 90%.

DISH currently holds $\~40B of spectrum assets, with $15B of debt and $2B of cash with which to build out a network and meet the FCC's requirements.  [It has more mid-band spectrum than Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/25-charts-spectrum-ownership-united-states) \-- second only to AT&amp;T -- with no network to use it.  Analysts are hugely skeptical of DISH's ability to build out the infrastructure in time to meet the deadline.  There is also a growing concern that the spectrum assets aren't worth as much as Ergen was betting.

Along comes Sprint and T-Mobile.

The recent merger proposal of Sprint and T-Mobile draws a lot of concern over antitrust issues.  In an effort to appease the Justice Department, the two companies have agreed to sell a portion of their shared assets, including Sprint's own Boost Mobile and some spectrum.  The top bidder so far to the tune of $6 Billion: [DISH Network](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-18/dish-is-said-to-near-6-billion-deal-for-t-mobile-sprint-assets).  The Justice Department is looking on this purchase favorably, as it sees DISH as the best opportunity for a 4th carrier in the US, simply due to the huge amount of unused spectrum it's squatting on. Publicly, DISH hopes to finally put its spectrum to use through Sprint and T-Mobile's own network via Boost, effectively using the $6B to buy him more time to build out a network -- or squat on it some more.

BYND Short Interest and Borrow Rate Update,"S3 back from vacation and posted this update: 

BYND short interest is $883 mm; 5.42 mm shares shorted; 46.27% of float; 132% borrow fee. Shs shorted are up +11k, +0.20%, in June as its stock price rose +56.46%. Over the past week shs shorted decreased by -162k, -2.90%, as its stock price rose +0.34%.

New Borrows are charging 100-150% today. According to S3, of stocks with more than $50m in short interest, BYND has the highest borrow rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

5.42m shares shorted of a float of 11m. This is down slightly from a few days ago when it was 5.94m. The avg short borrow rate of 132% is up slightly from 115% on June 25th. However new borrows are getting charged 100-150%, well below the borrow rate of 250-350%. He still sees short supply as tight and this is a lender's market. From what I've been seeing when I call around, borrow rates fell from yesterday's 200% range to today around 122%. 

&amp;#x200B;

So probably the run up this week was a mini-squeeze. A true squeeze would see the shares shorted fall by probably 10-20% on an absolute basis.

G20 DD,"Trump already secured the US a good position, and he won't back down or compromise for less of the current tariff level. What could make Trump and his team pull out?  Strong and vengeful pushbacks from China, perhaps.

But that kinda pushback has NEVER been the case since the tariff war started (despite what appear to be retaliation tariffs by China ). There was no trade war, and it actually is the beginning of shifting manufacturers from China to Vietnam, India, and the US. This shift is inevitable, as Xi knows.   
Xi and his commie bros condemn protectionism lead by the US, along with reclaiming global trade networks as a bene system.  China cheated the WTO so it's kinda rich now. If the existing global trade networks tilt to the side of bilateral agreements between countries, China will be left as the untrustworthy cheater in the game. That's why they created their own game-The Belt and Road Initiative.   
The manufacturing shift is unstoppable, but possible to reduce its speed. China is smart on procrastinating the talks, and Trump has granted them several extensions. But these extensions are far from enough for China to establish their new game. Xi needs more time, not conflicts.   
Now let us focus on this weekend's Trump-Xi meeting. A trade deal will be made, because:  
\- China will not comply literally, just as what they did to WTO and all other shits they promised  
\- A trade deal with the US will encourage more countries to join China's Belt and Road game, and it buys China more time to lure more players in  
\- US companies in China need to pull out before major confrontations after the shift  
\- 2020 is still a possible break for China to have a new opponent (pro-China or not); it's safer to act tough after November 2020( talking tough means no shit)  
\- China needs foods from the US, at least before they finish their ""Prussian Potato Reform""-a term by yours truly  
\- Trump needs this for reelection chips to stack up; China will break all promises to make him look petty before the election.  
So, that's some basic points on why I loaded up calls and S&amp;P futures today.",SteviaJ0bs,1561738991,19,57,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6m7pk/g20_dd/

Barnes &amp; Noble DD: What am I missing here?,"Everyone knows this place is a dying company but it took my wife to tell me ""I go tot Barnes and Nobel, take photos of the book covers, then go home and buy them off Amazon for like 2/3rds off!"" I pull up option chains and they're stupid cheap for leaps. Jan 2021 $7 Put was $.60 yesterday when I made the first trade. Jan 2020 @ $6.00 strike was $.05 each contract. For 6 months out? In the money? Only 5 cents? What am I missing? Am I retarded or just lucky?

&amp;#x200B;

In looking at the dying company itself, it's dividend payout is $.60/yr, it's next payment of $.15 is early August, they have $9m cash on hand with a pay out of $10.1 coming up, this is all alongside same store sales dropping, revenues dropping and margins squeezing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only explanation I can think of is the volume on this stock is too little to make any real moves?  In the next quarter I can see them announcing store closures, dividend cuts (was also hoping for that out of Gamestop and it took years for their management to smarten up) perhaps an announcement of ""decreased expectations""?

Long netflix you fucktards,"Not gonna lie, I’m a fucking retard so this can be flaired as satire if the mods feel like it.

Losing the office may hurt a little netflix in the short run but I think it will help them in the future. They are paying a fuck ton of cash to keep it on air like friends. Losing it will loosen some cash to spend on new projects and thats what will help netflix in the long run.

Netflix is basically treated as a utility (I won’t put any sources because I’m lazy) so they have more downside protection then you guys think. When the office will be gone, it will be stale to those people that has been binge watching it for the last 7 years anyways. This will force people to watch the other content like netflix’s original exclusive content. There’s going to be some gems for sure like bird box where everyone will talk about it and makes memes and shit on it. That stuff sells a fuck ton of new subscriptions. 

Not every project will have that effect but netflix has a pretty solid and courageous management so they invest in studios that have ideas and balls like the studio that made birdbox. New goose eggs will come out in the future for sure. The only thing going tits up is your wife’s tiddies in my face while I fuck her on the deck of my yatch.

TradeWar+Iran blowing stuff up+IMO2020= Nice opportunity,"My credentials: I talk too and work with Crude Traders from the worlds largest trading houses (Vitol, Trafigura, Glencor, Mercuria, Gunvor) on a daily bases.  I always make it a point to ask their thoughts on the global market. So this is derived from those answers. I don't trade big, bro. 

The Position: 50% of total investment in stock, leveraged junior gold miners ETF $JNUG and 50% on ITM $USO calls expiring December 2019.

The fundamentals: 
1- To spite of what you might read, the physical crude market is tight. The price of crude has mainly been suppressed by fears of slowing global economy and the US-China ”trade war”. 
 
2- IMO2020 is a global mandate that ships will have to burn low sulfur fuel to remain compliant. This will tap into the retail fuels market and render residual fuel oil less profitable due to the need for scrubbing. This will add demand and decrease usable retail supply.

3- Gold has always been the ”go to” when the economy goes to shit.

4- Irans economy has gone to shit so they are blowing shit up.

5- China is threatening to cut off rare earth metals exports to US if trade tariffs continue.

Here is my take. 1 of 3 things are going to happen. 

1-No agreement is reached and the ”trade war” continues, keeping fuel prices suppressed and raising the value of gold/mining companies in the near term. Fuel prices don't drop much due to the coming IMO2020 risk and the fact that Iran is shooting down drones (which also helps $JNUG) You close both positions making a profit on $JNUG and losing little if anything on $USO calls.

2- No agreement is reached and the ”trade war” continues, keeping fuel prices suppressed for now. China doesn't cut off rare earth metal exports so position doesn't change much... until Iran blows something else up. That coupled with the IMO2020 squeeze causes oil prices to go way up around October. $USO call premiums go way up, closing midferm with a profit in calls and slight loss if at all on $JNUG (because Iran blowing drones up helps $JNUG). 

3- An agreement is reached and oil prices go up in the near term. Iran continues blowing stuff up which helps both positions and the IMO2020 squeeze causes fuel prices to go up even higher, tipping the market into a recession. Now we’re at war, gas prices are sky high and the stock market is crashing... but at least both positions increased nicely and you close long term with sick tendies just in time for Christmas.

In conclusion, I think strategy hedges against risk of loss nicely while holding huge upside potential.",ElFullSend,1561085397,11,13,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c355if/tradewariran_blowing_stuff_upimo2020_nice/

"Attis Industries, ATIS - The ""Long and Hard"" Truth and Why I'm All In","**Starter Information**

(If you want the fast track to my conclusion, it’s at the bottom. Seriously, it's a long read, consider it.)

(If you're looking to trade this thing, it's on a slight uptrend and it's bounced between $1.60 and $3.00 pretty consistently over the past two months with a very low float. I've opened up a small position two times now where I've gotten in at 1.90 and sold out at around 2.30. Overall though most of my position is in Attis for the long term. (OTC) GERS is a solid buy if you can find shares around $0.055 and sell out at $0.08 or $0.10. I'm long GERS too.  I'm not a trader so take this advice with a grain of salt. Moving on)

**Background**

Attis Industries, formerly known as Meridian Waste Solutions, is a conglomerate with businesses in the healthcare, medical waste, and environmental technology sectors. Management believes that the multi-industry structure is a key factor in their ability to create value for their shareholders and to fund developing operations. Attis Industries, $ATIS, currently sells on the NYSE at a market cap of between $7,000,000 &amp; $10,000,000, and has a total of 3,441,000 common shares outstanding. 

As of 05/17/19 they are delinquent on their Q1/10-Q/2019, 10-K/2018, and Q3/10-Q/2018 filings (SEC Notice: [https://bit.ly/2XiAb43](https://bit.ly/2XiAb43)). As of 06/06/19 they have entered into the SEC appeals process to try to remain listed on the NYSE. According to this tweet [https://bit.ly/2WRA8Yo](https://bit.ly/2WRA8Yo) (06/06/19), the hearing went well, but no decision has been released yet. As of today, 06/20/19, Attis Industries still remains listed on the NYSE. Most of what you need to know about the SEC Appeals process can be found here [https://bit.ly/31HzdgR](https://bit.ly/31HzdgR).

Attis’ latest non-delinquent 10-Q (Filed Date: 08/20/18 For Date: QPE 06/30/18) can be found here [https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp](https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp) and the one prior (Filed Date: 05/16/18 For Date: QPE 03/31/18) can be found here [https://bit.ly/2XXfjfC](https://bit.ly/2XXfjfC).

**The Formation of Attis**

On 02/20/18, Meridian Waste Solutions ($MRDN) sold their waste management service operations to Warren Equity Partners for $90,000,000 and the remaining operations were rebranded as Attis Industries ($ATIS). The transaction eliminated $87,000,000 of debt and allowed the newly formed entity, Attis Industries, to pursue new business opportunities in higher margin industries. The remaining assets, not sold in the deal, are worth around $44,653,407 according to their most recent 10-Q ([https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp](https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp) Page 1) and were expected to generate $3,000,000 in pre-tax earnings, or approximately $0.15 per share according to Jeff Cosman, CEO ([https://bit.ly/2x1P1wP](https://bit.ly/2x1P1wP)). The remaining debt includes approximately $20,123,523 in current liabilities and $8,914,995 in non-current liabilities according to the same 10-Q.

Since the formation in 2018, Attis has made multiple acquisitions and formed multiple partnerships pertaining to all three of their business segments. They are listed below. 

**Partnerships**

**American Science and Technology Corporation (ASTC)**

Their first partnership came on 11/10/19 and was formed with American Science and Technology Corporation (ASTC) ([https://bit.ly/2MVMijq](https://bit.ly/2MVMijq)). From this partnership, Attis gained the exclusive licensing rights to ASTC’s patented Organosolv Process Technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Attis Industries will have an exclusive commercial license to ASTC patents and a lease for the ASTC Biomass Processing Facility in Wausau, WI. ASTC’s patented technology proclaims to drive the value of Lignin up from $50 per ton to between $600 and $2000 per ton.

**Unnamed Tennessee Hospital**

Their second partnership came on 12/04/17 and was formed with an unnamed Tennessee Hospital. According to Attis, “The partnership between Attis Healthcare and the hospital will result in a profitable, highly functioning hospital laboratory that will provide improved health care for the citizens of the hospital's community. A hospital laboratory of this size can typically process, on average, upwards of 1,000 samples per month, once it is fully functioning, leading to a potential increase in revenue in excess of $5,000,000.” 

**Unnamed Company Believed to be Greenshift Corporation**

Their third partnership came on 01/16/18 and was formed with an unnamed company that is believed to be Greenshift Corporation ([https://bit.ly/2IV77Gv](https://bit.ly/2IV77Gv)). With the partnership came a licensing agreement for a proprietary biofuel process technology. This technology is expected to reduce construction costs and improve profitability of ethanol by an estimated $0.40 per gallon. Just prior to the announcement of this partnership, on the exact same day, Attis was awarded a USDA $3,000,000 grant to support the commercialization of patented and patent-pending lignin conversion and refining technologies that it owns. (Grant Details: [https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgibin/starfinder/0?](http://pr.report/dPZoy7Fr)). Conclusion, biofuels may have just become $0.40 more profitable.

**New Representative Group**

Their fourth partnership came on 06/04/18 and was formed with New Representative Group ([https://bit.ly/2RqBokn](https://bit.ly/2RqBokn)). The Rep Group includes approximately 300 representatives from across the country, and it will provide toxicology and blood samples for testing in the new Attis federal lab as well as other partner labs that Attis works with throughout the U.S. 

Two months after this partnership was formed, Attis obtained its CLIA Certification for its first internally developed lab ([https://bit.ly/2WTLxan](https://bit.ly/2WTLxan)). The Company expects that this federal laboratory will be testing a baseline of 3,000 toxicology samples per month by the end of 2018, which trends to approximately $600,000 per month of revenue and over $7,000,0000 for 2018. The Company also expects to add blood testing to its federal laboratory by the end of the year, which will drive additional revenue growth for the Company moving forward.  By the second quarter of 2019, we expect the combined number of blood and toxicology samples in the federal lab to be between 5,000 and 8,000 per month. This means the federal lab is expected to be generating over $1,000,000 in revenue per month by mid-2019. This adds around $12,000,000 to Attis’ total revenue. 

**Noveda Technologies**

Their fifth partnership came on 06/06/18 and was formed with Noveda Technologies as part of the JVCo acquisition where Attis acquired a license to use Noveda’s technologies ([https://bit.ly/2IT1R6o](https://bit.ly/2IT1R6o)). Noveda is leading the integration of emerging concepts like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to streamline resource management, while helping to decrease consumption, optimize performance, and reduce carbon footprints for customers and users world-wide. Noveda's patented monitoring solution integrates consumption and generation data to provide actionable real time intelligence for owners, operators and users, including for users across networks of production facilities.

**Jordan Forest Products**

Their sixth partnership came on 07/17/18 and was formed with Jordan Forest Products LLC ([https://bit.ly/2Y2OOFG](https://bit.ly/2Y2OOFG)). With the partnership, Attis announced the execution of a letter of intent with Jordan Forest Products, LLC (“Jordan”) to provide raw material feedstock procurement services for its recently announced biorefinery in Barnesville, Georgia.  Jordan is a division of Jordan Lumber &amp; Supply Inc., one of the largest privately-owned lumber companies in the U.S.

**Gyeuongbuk Institute of Science and Technology**

The seventh partnership came on 08/09/18 and was formed with the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and technology (DIGST) ([https://bit.ly/2RoUdVd](https://bit.ly/2RoUdVd)). With the partnership, Attis gained an exclusive license agreement for DIGIST technologies. An excerpt from the press release states , ”Attis Announced the execution of a sponsored research and exclusive license agreement with Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (“DGIST”), to develop and commercialize processes that use sunlight to efficiently promote conversion of carbon dioxide (“CO2”) and water into hydrocarbon fuels compatible with the current energy infrastructure.  The new agreement is intended to build on the Company’s and DGIST’s prior work, including the work of Professor Su-Il In and his team at DGIST, as recently reported in Energy and Environmental Science, a journal published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, in an article entitled *High-Rate Solar-light Photoconversion of CO2 to Fuel: Controllable Transformation from C1 to C2 Products*. Professor In and his team recently demonstrated CO2 photoconversion efficiencies exceeding ten times anything previously reported, achieving sunlight-to-fuel (Joule-to-Joule) photoconversion efficiencies of up to 3.3% (quantum yield 91%). Such efficiencies are an important milestone, and demonstrate that an industrial-scale sunlight-powered CO2 to hydrocarbon fuel technology is realistic to envision.”

**North Crest Medical Center of Springfield**

The eighth partnership came on 10/08/18 and was formed with North Crest Medical Center of Springfield. North Crest Medical Center is a community hospital located in Springfield, Tennessee.  Attis Healthcare, a subsidiary of Attis Industries, will assist in the expansion and operation of their existing state-of-the-art hospital laboratory and provide outreach services within the community.  Attis estimates that the laboratory will be able to test upwards of 1,000 specimens per month and the Company expects to generate revenue and cash flow almost immediately from this partnership.

**Unnamed Oklahoma Medical Clinic**

The ninth partnership came on 10/31/18 and was formed with an unnamed Oklahoma medical clinic ([https://bit.ly/2FlC3yu](https://bit.ly/2FlC3yu)). Attis believes the account can generate upwards of $1,000,000 in annualized revenue. 

**Novozymes**

The tenth partnership came on 01/16/19 and was formed with Novozymes (https://bit.ly/2ZxC9uF). Novozymes is a world leader in biotechnology for renewable fuel production.  Under this newly announced relationship, Novozymes has committed to supplying the enzymes required by Attis to convert its pulp into sugar at all of its planned biorefineries.

**Iowa State University**

The eleventh partnership came on 01/24/19 and was formed with Iowa State University. The partnership called for a funded research program to develop carbon fibers for use in a wide variety of applications derived entirely or predominately from lignin produced at Attis’ planned biorefineries.

**Acquisitions**

**DTX Medical**

Their first acquisition came on 10/23/17 with the purchase of DTX Medical, LLC ([https://bit.ly/2x26JQW](https://bit.ly/2x26JQW)). DxT Medical is a national healthcare distribution partner aiming to improve patient care and provide cost-saving opportunities through innovative, compliant, comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for patients and healthcare providers. The all-stock transaction for DxT Medical was valued at $462,000 and comprised of 350,000 restricted shares of Meridian Waste Solutions valued at $1.32 per share. I was unable to find potential revenue or income estimates for this transaction.

**Welness Benefits LLC, LGMG LLC (verify Resource Group), Integrity Lab Solutions LLC**

Their second acquisition came on 11/20/17 with the purchases of WelNess Benefits LLC, 71.65% Membership Interest in LGMG LLC (Verifi Resource Group) and Integrity Lab Solutions LLC ([https://bit.ly/31KRN7R](https://bit.ly/31KRN7R)). The 71.65% interest in LGMG LLC comes from the WelNess Benefits LLC acquisition which owned the initial interest. The three acquired companies specialize in medical hospital laboratory testing and diagnostics operations. These acquisitions are said to be producing at least $1,070,000 in revenue (Page 37) with $766,141 in associated operating expenses (Page 37). All this is according to Attis’ most recent 10-Q ([https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp](https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp) “Page 37”). The total costs of these acquisitions are as follow: Stock Consideration $1,000,000, Warrant Consideration $896,645, Contingent Consideration $2,220,683, Total $4,117,328 (Page 35). Conclusion: Total Cost $4,117,328, Total Revenues $1,070,000, Total Operating Expenses $766,141.

**Advanced Lignin Biocomposites LLC &amp; UT Battelle LLC Partnership**

Their third acquisition came on 11/30/17 with the purchase of Advance Lignin Biocomposites LLC (Advance Lignin) ([https://bit.ly/2IrmSWI](https://bit.ly/2IrmSWI)). Advanced Lignin owns and develops lignin recovery, production and applications technology. Advanced Lignin uses its methods to more cost-effectively produce many different materials, including adhesives, renewable fuels, carbon fiber, and plastics. Advanced Lignin’s main operations generated revenues of approximately $7,000,000 to $10,000,000 and $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 of cash flows the year prior. Along with this acquisition came Advanced Lignin’s partnership with UT-Battelle LLC, the management and operating contractor for the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. On 05/29/18 Attis restructured this acquisition to reduce the associated expense and liabilities of the deal by about $1,350,000 or 50%. The estimated total cost for this acquisition is as follows: ABL Shortfall Provision $2,307,363, Shares Issued and Sold Value by ABL $1,032,000, Total Cost $3,319,363 (ALB SFP Page F-39, Shares Issued Page F-22, Document 10-K 2017 [https://bit.ly/2xpqK7b](https://bit.ly/2xpqK7b)). Take the “estimated total cost” number with a grain of salt, it’s all I was able to gather from the 10-K and I was unable to find an official number online. 

**Genarex FD LCC**

Their fourth acquisition came on 05/29/18 with purchase of a 49% stake in Genarex FD LLC ([https://bit.ly/2KoKA8l](https://bit.ly/2KoKA8l)). Genarex is a technology development company focused on refining low-cost renewable feedstocks into functional biofillers. Genarex is capable of recovering about 1.1 pounds of biobased plastics additive per gallon of ethanol produced, which equates to an expected $11 million in new EBITDA from each 100 million gallon per year ethanol facility. Under applicable agreements, the Company agreed, in pertinent part, to pay an aggregate purchase price of $2,266,667, plus 8% of the EBITDA and certain material transaction proceeds of the Company’s Innovations group. An initial payment was made at closing in the form of 1,000,000 common shares and 22,600 of the Company’s Series G preferred stock. The preferred stock converts into common stock at the greater of $0.50 per share or 100% of the prevailing market price for the thirty days prior to conversion, up to a maximum of 9.9% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. The agreements require the Company to register the shares by August 31, 2018, and for all sales thereafter to be limited to the greater of $50,000 or 50,000 common shares per month, amongst other conditions. Conclusion, adds an extra approximate $10,120,000 to Attis’ EBITDA per plant.

FLUX Carbon LLC (JVCo)

The companies fifth acquisition came on 05/31/19 with the purchase of an 80% stake in FLUX Carbon LLC (JVCo) ([https://bit.ly/2Iv5SyZ](https://bit.ly/2Iv5SyZ)). JVCo is a new joint venture company between Attis Industries and Greenshift Corporation that holds the rights to an expansive portfolio of clean technologies and manages an existing engineering and licensing business. This new joint venture can be expected to initially contribute between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 to Attis’ earnings. The existing business generated approximately $7,000,000 per year in sales with gross margins of about 70% for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017.  The Company agreed to pay an earn-out based purchase price with a floor of $18 million. An initial payment was paid at closing in the form of restricted shares of the Company’s stock, including 180,000 shares of the Company’s Series G preferred stock. GreenShift is required to use the first proceeds received upon sale of the shares to pay or refinance its senior secured debt. 

The opportunity with Greenshift and JVCo could be huge for Attis. Greenshift is currently in legal battles over patent infringement, claiming that multiple ethanol producers have infringed on their patents. According to Attis’ press release linked above, “CleanTech and its inventors developed and commercialized a process that intercepts the flow of that final third in the plant, extracts corn oil, and returns the stream back to the host for completion of drying. The extracted oil is then most commonly sold as a feedstock for refining into biodiesel for about $0.25 per pound. CleanTech has licensed its portfolio of corn oil extraction patents to producers of about 12% of the 15 billion gallons of ethanol produced annually in the U.S. However, CleanTech estimates that upwards of 90% of the corn ethanol industry practices methods covered by CleanTech’s patents, and some of those patents are the subject of litigation which CleanTech has asserted against about 10% of the industry alleging infringing use since 2010. 

On 09/05/18 Attis and Greenshift filed an appeal to overturn the initial ruling that Greenshift’s patent portfolio was unenforceable. The legal battle is still raging on. More information on the legal battle can be found at [http://greenshift-gers.blogspot.com/](http://greenshift-gers.blogspot.com/). The full appeal can be found here [https://www.greenshift.com/content/investorresources/pdf/appeal\_2018\_08\_29\_brief.pdf](https://www.greenshift.com/content/investorresources/pdf/appeal_2018_08_29_brief.pdf). 

**Quality Rx Returns LLC**

The companies sixth acquisition came on 08/08/18 with the purchase of Quality Rx Returns LLC ([https://bit.ly/2WVCIBF](https://bit.ly/2WVCIBF)). Quality Rx Returns is a full-service provider of pharmaceutical reverse logistic solutions, serving pharmacies, hospitals, and healthcare providers nationwide. Attis plans to grow the Quality Rx business through its existing robust sales infrastructure, including its recently announced partnership with a new nationwide representative group. The Company’s potential network now includes the 4,749 hospitals and 45,000 long term care facilities located in the United States. In addition, the Quality Rx acquisition is expected to expand the Company’s service capability for large quantity generators and manufacturers of pharmaceutical waste by the third quarter of 2018, and enable the Company to expand its licensing to include high margin services for the return and destruction of DEA pharmaceuticals. I was unable to find the financial impacts of this acquisition.

**Custom Cable Services (Hasn’t Closed Yet, Both Parties Still Working On)**

The company’s “potential” seventh acquisition came on 09/10/18 with a purchase agreement between Attis and Custom Cable Services ([https://bit.ly/2ZCRpGN](https://bit.ly/2ZCRpGN)). The agreement is an all stock deal valued at $4.6 million. The transaction has yet to close but is still being worked on by both parties. Custom Cable Services, Inc. is a broadband network construction and maintenance firm. Over the past 5 years, CCS has generated consistent annual revenues between $10-$12 million with $1.5-$2.0 million in EBITDA. CCS has key long-term relationships with Charter and Cox Communications for multi-year projects.

**Fulton Ethanol Plant**

The company’s eighth and most recent acquisition came on 06/04/19 with the purchase of Sunoco’s 85,000,000-gallon Fulton ethanol plant ([https://bit.ly/2ESnkLh](https://bit.ly/2ESnkLh)). According to Attis, the plant is expected to produce $150,000,000 in annualized revenues and lay the foundation for their other patented technologies. With their current patent and license portfolio, they expect to have industry leading margins at this facility. They also have plans to upgrade this location from 85,000,000 gallons to 100,000,000 gallons, adding an extra $20,000,000 and pushing revenues to $170,000,000. At today’s current ethanol prices (06/19/2019), ethanol plants are averaging a profit of between $0.17 and $0.30 per gallon of ethanol produced ([https://bit.ly/2Rm3q0k](https://bit.ly/2Rm3q0k)). This means that Attis could see a bottom line of between $17,000,000 and $30,000,000 from Fulton alone. Attis also has plans to purchase two to three more facilities over then next one to three years and expand operations at Fulton to include other bioproducts such as plastics and carbon fiber. The current full specifications of this plant are as follows: 85,000,000 gallons of ethanol, 360,000,000 pounds of CO2, 455,000,000 pounds of distiller's dried grains with solubles, 18,000,000 pounds of distillers corn oil, and 4,000,000 pounds of malted grain. This plant was purchased from Sunoco for $20,000,000 and was recently appraised at a value of $57,000,000. Sunoco had a write down of $47,000,000 for the facility in their most recent 10-Q ([https://bit.ly/2Kt5ov7 Page 6](https://bit.ly/2Kt5ov7%20Page%206)) leading me to believe that the assets true value is somewhere between the $20,000,000 purchase price and the $47,000,000 write down.

**Conclusion**

So, what does this all add up to? If you play it extremely conservatively, after their most recent acquisition and excluding non-closed deals and non-guaranteed figures, Attis will have a total of $91,653,407 in total assets and a debt load of between $30,000,000 and $35,000,000. Total revenues will be between $150,000,000 and $180,000,000 by the end of 2019. From these revenues, they will have a bottom line of at least $17,000,000, possibly more. 

What’s the downside? They are delinquent on their filings for some undisclosed reason and are currently wrapped up in a patent infringement case that could decide the future of Attis Innovations, Greenshift and JVCo. It is my belief that the JVCo joint venture is partly responsible for Attis’ delinquent filings. The downside of this investment could be zero for both companies. With Attis’ recent acquisition, management’s capital allocation ability, presidential policies, and the companies Healthcare revenues, I personally feel that at least Attis is here to stay. 

Attis currently trades at a market cap of below $10,000,000 and I believe that the market cap should be at least equivalent to my estimated book value of around $50,000,000 at some point in the future. This figure does not include any potential growth avenues or discounted cash flow valuations. I believe the potential market cap could be much, much higher if everything goes in Attis’ favor. The downside risk is still very real so be wary and I would recommend not betting the farm on it. Good luck and happy investing, or gambling if that’s what you’re into; I don’t judge.

It's space stock trading at a market cap \~$440M with &gt;$2B in yearly revenue and $550M+ EBITDA, got hit really hard after a series of bad situations which was pretty much the perfect storm: downturn in large satellite contracts, short sell attack, high debt, potential dividend elimination, satellite failure, trouble in liquidating part of business (GEO), transition from Canadian to US based forcing big Canadian holders to sell. 

The Stock price crashed from \~$60 to $4, but has since recovered quickly to $7.4 now, which I think is still undervalued by several factors. The Company has $3.5B in debt, which is largely responsible for the recent share price drop. However they have enough liquidity available and recently received a $183M insurance payout on the failed satellite: [https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-05-03/maxar-technologies-to-receive-full-insurance-payout-for-worldview-4-satellite-loss](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-05-03/maxar-technologies-to-receive-full-insurance-payout-for-worldview-4-satellite-loss)

Thing is, there isnt really any enforceable way to prevent China from stealing and using US companies' IP.

Buy the Rumor Sell the News,"Had a few requests for some plays so I thought I would make another post, link to last week: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byo069/part\_2/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byo069/part_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Notes on last week:

Ended up not seeing the dip I was hoping for to start off last week but some red candles early on made it worthwhile to be short at open. I was hoping for a gap fill to 285 to start off last week but as I mentioned here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzwqgf/what\_are\_your\_moves\_tomorrow\_june\_13/eqy9fza?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzwqgf/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_june_13/eqy9fza?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) I started to go long delta/theta last Wednesday. It has played out well so far.

Results from Forecast: 

1. [https://imgur.com/a/hwdhzic](https://imgur.com/a/hwdhzic)

2. [https://imgur.com/a/cxwsZmt](https://imgur.com/a/cxwsZmt)

I included two forecasts, one including the previous Fridays close, and one without. I think there may be a bug in the model that causes a gap between the last value in the data set, and the first predicted value leading to the overstated drop predicted last Monday. Perhaps it is just confirmation biases, only time will tell.

This week:

Buy the rumor sell the news. I will not be looking to close at the model for this DD given the extraordinary circumstances we are seeing with FOMC this week. Instead let’s look at some other data as to why I am selling the news. 

1. [https://imgur.com/a/yaUHrgg](https://imgur.com/a/yaUHrgg) This is a 50-period correlation between SPX and VIX. When the correlation spikes like it did before Feb 2018, October 2018, May 2019, etc. one should be looking for volatility. Right now, the correlation appears to be bottoming out and starting to curl upwards. Something to take note of. 

2. From a technical perspective, SPY, IWM and QQQ all have bearish divergence on the 1- and 2-hour scales. [https://imgur.com/a/PWu1wWe](https://imgur.com/a/PWu1wWe), [https://imgur.com/a/FsOEgul](https://imgur.com/a/FsOEgul). This is essentially the opposite set up I saw when I made my first post [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bum65c/short\_term\_bullish/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bum65c/short_term_bullish/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Looking for this to play out after FOMC.

3. Finally, [https://imgur.com/a/gQ3SRiY](https://imgur.com/a/gQ3SRiY). The DIX and GEX. DIX has fallen dramatically the past week as SPX has soared and is now at the lowest level of 2019. This is a huge red flag for me, though not a sell signal in of itself. But when you pair it with the fact that we have FOMC tomorrow, I think it is a sign big players aren’t going long here and are taking off risk. Last time we saw a dip this hard in DIX was before the China trade war blew up on May 3, I will not be going long anytime soon.

From a fundamental perspective, I believe that they market is pricing too many rate cuts too soon, and I am not the only one who thinks that. Goldman, BofA, MS, UBS all have told clients to not expect an overly dovish Fed, Goldman and I believe MS see no rate cuts this year.

If you think they are saying this to try and stoke fear and sell some puts to retail, then I can’t stop you from believing that. But I think that this, combined with DIX is a pretty clear indication not to expect JP to cut rates in June and maybe even July or allude to more accommodating monetary policy.

All of this being said, I am merely speculating as to the most likely outcome and can’t say for certain what will happen. I picked up some 298 6/28 SPY puts this afternoon and am up modestly. Will add more before FED most likely. I will be holding as long as bearish divergence holds on the hourly SPY chart. I would say that the safest thing would be to sit this week out, but this isn’t r/investing.

Right now, I have stepped away from my model and have started working on making a database with option data such as Greeks, IV, volume, etc. Here is something I whipped up: [https://imgur.com/a/kpGOPOD](https://imgur.com/a/kpGOPOD). Right now, I can download and store the entire option chain of any stock and calculate Greeks and back solve for IV. More on this latter.

As always and do your own research before making any play and now that FOMC will swing the market hard one way or the other.

The real winners of the NBA finals.,"Okay okay, I rarely do DD because I am always wrong but this time I ain't. 

The real winners of the NBA Finals are business that directly profit/indirectly profit for it. Now I live in Toronto Canada and boi oh boi the hype is 💯💯💯

The biggest winner are the two baddies of the Canadian telecom industry, Rogers ($RCI) and Bell ($BCE). Rogers media owns Sportsnet and Bell owns TSN which both have the rights to show the NBA Finals in Canada. Why is that important? Well, the first record set in Canada was Game 2. It had 4.3 million Canadians watching. Shit got real fast. By Game 5, the NBA finals were the most watched broadcast in Canadian history. 13.4 million people, roughly 1 in 3 Canadians watched Game 5. Together, 22 million out of 37 million Canadians, have at least watched the finals once


Now let's the peak viewers for Rogers and Bell. Rogers's Sportsnet peak viewership was 6.4 million (about 1 in 6 Canadians we're watching the finals on Sportsnet) and it was during Game 5. Bell's TSN had a peak viewership of 7.7 million during Game 6 (about 1 in 5 Canadians). Remember those are peaks, there have always and millions of people watching at any time during Game 1-6.

These guys made alot of money with subscriptions and advertisements. Rogers' Q2 earnings release date is July 17, 2019. Bell's Q2 earnings release date is August 1, 2019. Calls on both.

My thoughts on BYND post yesterday's fall,"Upfront disclaimer: I'm long BYND. Now on yesterday's crash and why I'm still long / didn't sell: 

* TLRY had multiple &gt;10% one-day crashes before it peaked at over $200 on 19-Sept. Then it halved over the next few trading days but then shot up 65%. Reason I make this analogy is because I also view BYND as TLYR 2.0 with the added benefit that it's the only pure-play on a very hot new theme (fake meat) vs. TLRY when it was one of many stocks in a very hot new theme (marijuana).
* BYND also has the added benefit of free publicity from celebrities &amp; influencers (who have a vested interest to promote because they're owners too) + from the vegan community especially considering that founder Ethan Brown is vegan and their products are GMO and soy free (unlike Impossible Foods).
* I also don't think the short squeeze has happened yet because short interest remained at the \~50% level during the 2 days where it popped (Fri and Mon). Why? One explanation is that if you take a granular look at the short interest data, most of the shorts were done at the $70-80 level. So perhaps they're waiting to get closer to this level to break-even / reduce their loss before realising it. But that's ANOTHER \~40% fall on top of yesterday's fall just to break-even yet alone recoup the crazy amount they've been paying in borrow fees + make any profit.
* But we're not going to get to that $70-80 level. Why? Here are the broker price targets in descending order: $126 (Bernstein) / $125 (CS) / $121 (JPM) / $105 (Jefferies) / $101 (BAML) / $91 (Consumer Edge - have no idea who they are) / $76 (GS). If BYND hits $100, then you have 3 analysts with &gt;20% upside who'll upgrade it. If BYND fell 25% yesterday because of one analyst downgrade, how do you think it'll react to if 3 analysts upgraded?
* Summary from all this: most of those who shorted will never make a profit. Eventually they'll have to throw in the towel because of how much they're bleeding on a daily basis in borrow fees.
* In the meantime, I think there's huge scope for positive news-flow over the next 1-2 months that can cause a pop in the stock price. Announcing additional trials with QSRs (quick-service restaurants), existing trials going into full partnerships (e.g. Tim Hortons - this got announced this morning) and once again mgmt's conservative 140% YoY increase in 2019 revenue only includes post-trial partnerships (i.e. Tim Hortons is now additional upside), entering new markets (e.g. Asia which on the conference call mgmt said they want to aggressively enter), expanding their footprint in Europe (where rival Impossible Food is struggling to access because of their GMO product which the EU is very anal about), and so on. And of course, the mother of all announcements: a trial with McDonalds. I still expect this to happen in the near-term.
* Summary: I still think the stock has room to run over the next few months. I'm personally waiting for the above catalysts to happen (new QSR trials, McDonalds announcement, short-squeeze) before thinking of trimming / exiting. I plan to exit starting in October either way because at the end of October is when the IPO 180-day lock-up ends (lots of insider selling from VCs and other early investors who want to monetise their investment + additional supply of shares makes it easier to short).
* Disclaimer: this is just my thinking of how things can play out and I can be completely wrong. This is not investment advice whatsoever and invest at your own risk.

Roast Me again. I am adding to my BYND position.,"Today is a crap day. No way to argue otherwise. But I believe the actual short squeeze hasn't happened yet. As of yesterday's data from S3, 49.9% of the shares are still short. When I called Interactive Brokers today, they quoted me 394% to short the stock, up from 165% last night. The IB employee told me it was the highest rate he's ever seen on the platform. There are still NO shares to short. Yes it is overvalued, and yes the stock is down this morning- but I think a squeeze is still inbound. I may be wrong, so please don't follow my lead. I am simply adding a small bit of calls. Not a crazy amount. I am buying August $200 calls. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shorts typically don't get charged for holding intra-day, just overnight. So if I am right, I believe we'll see some covering into the close, maybe a sell-off tomorrow morning, followed by the continued run-up from the squeeze. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just my 2 cents. This is INSANELY RISKY and only buy calls if you A) know what you are doing and B) use a TINY amount of capital because you are likely to lose it all. 

I am not an investment advisor and the stock is overvalued.

Short/Put AMD,"Seems like everyone right now has the consensus of AMD going the moon. Well, I'm here to tell you you're *fucking wrong*.

Listen, at the moment AMD's at an ATH. And if you would take a look at its YTD chart you'll see that it's about to have it's double-top; or, in short, it's about to hit that high it's hit before and once it hits that high/its resistance (again) at 34-34.85, AMD's going to have another dramatic pullback. I don't know how much but if you look at the last pullback then you can probably estimate by how much percentage it'll drop this week.

If you give me any E3 bullshit-- don't. E3's all hype. Repeat. All hype. Everything they're announcing won't even be considered in their quarterly revenues and other financials till 2020 holiday season. That includes Project Scarlett, Zen III Architect, etc. 

Btw, SPY's due for a pullback too. Both will either happen tomorrow or Wednesday. Just a matter of time. Get out before the sea of red hits you.

BYND Borrow Rates,"I know there have been a lot of posts about BYND. Sorry for making one more! 

Here is an update on borrow rates that I have found: Calling around I got 127% (up from 123% on Friday afternoon), but S3 is reporting 134% on existing shorts and 450-700% on new borrows. TLRY peaked at 900%. Apparently 51% of float are still short somehow as of 30 minutes ago...

&amp;#x200B;

S3 also believes that most of this run-up has been long buying, NOT SHORT COVERING. I don't know how accurate that is, but I have no way to verify that. If that is the case, this isn't TLRY 2.0. It means that Tilray was the BYND Beta Test. 

&amp;#x200B;

But SUPER IMPORTANT: at this point we are definitely close to the endgame. DO NOT put a lot of money in this stock at this point, if any. At some point soon, it will crash hard. I don't know when. It could have already peaked. Please don't lose money trying to cherry pick the top.

Notes On last week

Last week turned out much better than I expected. Dow had its largest one week gain of 2019 after FED alluded to the fact, they may consider cutting interest rates. Obviously, the punch in the dick was Trumps announcement of tariffs on Mexico the day after I created the post above. While we are now well above those levels and even appear to have a trade deal with them now, it was not very fun holding calls that day. Ended up rolling them out so Theta didn’t fuck me over. 

I ended up selling to early on Thursday, but the Friday jobs number could have gone either way so I decided to get out. I am now net delta negative after opening some positions Friday, more on that latter. I appreciate the support the last post got along with people sending me pictures of their returns, was cool to be able to help some people out.

On to this week

I’ll start off by saying this won’t be the same type of post I made last week as well as it may be considerably longer. Focusing more on the model I use, if that doesn’t float your boat, you don’t have to read this, or do and shit post below. Either one works for me. 

The data

1. I’ll skip the SKEW index for now. It has increased since my last post but day to day it is not a particularly helpful indicator. 

2. [https://imgur.com/a/nTjPATV](https://imgur.com/a/nTjPATV) The 10 period moving average of the VIX call put ratio has increased a fair amount since my last post indicating there are increasingly more long bets on the VIX over the course of this rally. I will also add that the VIX has held up surprisingly well the past week, indicating the larger insinuations and traders that trade SPX options are buying more downside protection even with this rally. **Whenever VIX and SPX have a positive correlation, it generally is not a good sign**.

3. [https://imgur.com/a/qUJX49s](https://imgur.com/a/qUJX49s) The DIX has fallen slightly over this rally, nothing to shocking though and is still fairly high. Something that does concern me is the GEX. The GEX is a measure of market makers hedging obligations and the sharp rise over the past week looks somewhat similar to that of May 16 2019, and Nov 7 2018. Not an ideal time to buy after the GEX spikes. For more info see [https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/docs](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/docs)

4. From a TA perspective, a **pull back to start the week is by far the most likely outcome**. For SPY QQQ and IWM, there is bearish divergence on the PPO and Momentum and the Slow stochastic is about to cross below 80 on the 30 min chart. The hourly tell similar storied but the Slow Stochastic is slightly farther from 80. Look for this to stick below 80 as a sign the short-term trend has changed. [https://imgur.com/a/9g9M9ru](https://imgur.com/a/9g9M9ru)

The model

I have made some significant changes to the model I use. I decided to go from using inputs based solely off of the close of SPY, to using a **broader array of inputs such as oil prices and treasury yields** as well as I ramped up the number of Epochs used. Unfortunately, I have decided to keep the exact data/input structure I used private for my own reasons, mainly because I feel as if it is my secret sauce. I’ve spent quite a bit of time working on it and making the methods more well-known doesn’t exactly do me any favors. That being said, if you have any questions/criticisms regarding the model, please look at my older posts before asking them and I may or may not answer them. 

Here are the back test for the past ten weeks [https://imgur.com/a/ceuKDCr](https://imgur.com/a/ceuKDCr), sorry for the formatting, I didn’t feel like making each one its own picture. An important note, is that I switched from having the forecast and SPY having separate axis, to having a **shared y-axis using a percentage change from t=0**. One reason I think I missed timed my long entry last week is that I was using a relative scale. 

If I had used the % scale, I would have seen that the model was predicting a 4% downside to start off the period, but SPY had only fell 1.5% when I was looking to go long. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess. The only back test that did not turn out so good was the one starting 3/27. While SPY did finish that period with a slight pull back, the model predicted a much more significant down turn which we did not see. 

Here is the sum off the back tests along with the forecast for the next two weeks: [https://imgur.com/a/3AUFoe1](https://imgur.com/a/3AUFoe1). I went with the dual axis as over a long period time using a percentage method separate the graphs so that they are not as easy to compare, seeing as they are 20 day forecasts I think that this makes the most sense over a long period of time. **The correlation between the forecasts and SPY is .305**. Not perfect but doesn’t appear to be random. I will have to get a larger sample size to confirm this latter. 

Here is the forecast on a % terms: [https://imgur.com/a/Ixzn0eQ](https://imgur.com/a/Ixzn0eQ). I will be looking for a pull back early this weak to enter long positions and close my 6/14 call credit spreads, **looking for about 284-285 on SPY**. From my back tests it is clear that some movements are exaggerated and often don’t occur exactly on the predicted day, so I think it is safe to say you should not expect a 4% drop Monday. You’ll have to use some other data point to confirm a near term bottom.

Looking at the forecast together with the data, I will be playing call credit spreads, continuing to hold my SPY, V, and ROKU call credit spreads I opened Friday, and looking to get into ITM call debt spreads late this week. I will add that holding naked calls in this environment does not offer a favorable risk to reward ratio. ITM debt spreads will be my preferred strategy until the trade/economic outlook is clearer. Especially sense the Mexico trade news came out after hours Friday, I have no idea how the futures will react.

As always, ***This Is Not Advice To Buy Or Sell Any Security*** and you need to do your own research to come to your own conclusions. This is just a summary of the data I am looking at along with my plan for the next two weeks, which is subject to change without updating everyone who reads this.",Nathan-T1,1560108426,132,75,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byo069/part_2/
Time to enter an ANET position,"So it seems ANET took a major hit last earning on lowered guidance. According to their earnings call and info from CML Viz “one cloud titan has placed most orders on hold for Q2” which means either that one customer switched to CSCO or has decided to cut back on quarterly expenditures. It seems as though the price drop was an overreaction on the lowered guidance which happened to coincide with the broader market correction in the NASDAQ. I’m not sure why it’s still getting pulled down, but it seems to have settled in at the 200MA.

$FB prediction for week of 6/10-6/14,"So today I stumbled upon the amount of call volume for 6/14 that went through the roof at the $180 strike price. CNBC did a halftime report on it spotlighting just under 10k in volume. At close, volume was just shy of 38,000. They usually have a run up to earnings, but I’m not convinced it will have the same successful run up this time around. Here’s my DD

Chart analysis: https://ibb.co/zXY8Trz

As you can see on the 3 day chart, the yellow line on the bottom shows RSI around 50% and moves within a healthy range of median. The top channel in between the yellow lines show a fair price around $167-$168. You can see on Wednesday that there was the most volume and the price was steady between the $167-$168 range. Thursday had less volume, but stayed within range for the most part, but did hit $169, but wasn’t overbought. It was a healthy gain. Now looking at Friday, volume was high, traded $4-$5 higher, but RSI was over 70 majority of the day and didn’t fall below 68 at all. 

The Put call ratio is .006 for 6/14 $180s way in favor of calls. Now this can mean one of two things:

1) someone is trying to offload a shit on of shares at that strike and doesn’t want the price to drop with a major sell off. I don’t see this as the case, but maybe it is. 

2) market makers want to make money on writing calls to make up for the money they lost holding this stock before they sell their shares so they make more of a profit on the sale.  I see this as being the top since their was a decent amount of short interest this week. I’m in favor of this more than anything. Maybe they got wind of the discussions at G20 early and want to get out of Facebook. Maybe they just want to squeeze more money out of the market not expecting a $180 hit by Friday. Who knows? Bottom line, it just doesn’t look right. 

So from my prediction, I think FB is going to possibly run up in the short term Monday to sell more calls, but more than likely I think buyers just got trapped in calls that they thought were cheap and now there will be shares offloaded and bring the stock lower. Maybe not $150 in a week, but I see it at least getting back to mid $160s. If there’s a big sell off on Monday, the calls will more than likely be worthless. I don’t see an uptrend continuing for FB in the short term. 

Buy 6/14 $170p or fuck it and lotto some $160p and scrape some pennies while this shit is falling. Fuck, might even end up being ITM if there’s some major sell off action. Good luck out there.",fin425,1560056949,3,9,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bygwc2/fb_prediction_for_week_of_610614/

"If you liked Chernobyl, you'll love this","You have one month until a decision on the Uranium 232 bill needs a decision from Tariff man. The beauty of this play is that there is zero risk. Uranium is in a huge bear market and is about to explode in the next year or 2. All these stocks are at their lows and have zero downside. Go look at the max charts on all of them, they are identical. When this shit pops, its gonna rocket right past uranus. If Trump mandates a quota on US uranium, UUUU, URG, and UEC will take off. If he doesnt, they will stay right where they are. But, as soon as the spot price comes back up, you're gonna see a big spike anyways. Production is being cut and a supply shortfall is incoming. Look up Mike Alkin on youtube for further info, he knows his shit. So, 232 deadline is July 14th but nobody long really cares. This will, however get the ball rolling on increasing spot prices and the upcoming bull run. I own 5000 of each stock listed as well as a shit ton of CCJ and CCJ 20 dollar strike leaps for next year.

"For those of you looking to play stonks at E3, A new ETF launched(NERD) that actually isn't utter trash","Link to the ETF Page:  [https://nerdetf.com/nerd-etf](https://nerdetf.com/nerd-etf) 

The volume on the ETF really isn't there to do options reliably, but as a stock play it is still pretty interesting.

Because I know most of y'all are too lazy to click the damn link and read for yourself, below is a list of the ETFs holdings:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/i1xdmfnk66331.png

As you can see, for us Robinhood using peons, this ETF gives us nice exposure to many gaming companies outside of the US Stock Exchange.

I'm sure many of you in the angry reddit gamer demographic will need to go to the doctor 4 hours after reading this due to CD Projeckt SA being on the list of holdings. If you can get enoug blood back in your system to restore your eyesight for long enough to read the rest of the list, you'll also see that the balance of the ETF is fairly favorable as well.

The larger holdings are placed in companies that are either in growth mode(SE, HUYA, AFREECATV), or are generally healthy companies in likely underbought conditions(ATVI, HEAR), with some other nice companies sprinkled in. Some of the lower holdings present some risk, but since they are a relatively small share, I am not really concerned about it.

I will be taking a sizable(for me) position for E3 with anticipation of run-up during the conference, and a sell off immediately after. Once that happens I will likely sell NERD short term, then re-buy once I find another entry point.

Anyways I figured most of you NERDS(nailed it) probably missed the launch of the ETF in-between AMD FDs so I wanted to make sure that was on y'all's radar so I'm not losing money on this ETF by myself next week.",freeWeemsy,1560016320,137,50,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byal7q/for_those_of_you_looking_to_play_stonks_at_e3_a/

If they don’t change their growth plan, I’m worried their growth may come to a halt prematurely.

$FIS and $WP Deal,"Hello I am fecal\_destruction. You may know me from my wraith of fecal destruction waves, currently sweeping the nation.   


I appreciate knowing about catalyst opportunities because i feel like that is really a huge part of picking plays. So here's one i recently discovered. Nothing too exciting but its worth a blip on the RADAR...  


$FIS is currently undergoing antitrust legislation with the EU over their $WP takeover.. WP is a payment processing company. 

  
Why and how is this a catalyst? The EU regulators gave a date...  July 5th is the last day they have before making a decision on approval. 

  
Personally I'm thinking short term bearish on $FIS, there is multiple bearish engulfing daily candles on higher volume seen in the last 10 trading days. They are currently at the resistance.

FIS caught my eye as a TA short play, but i noticed they had this EU antitrust shit.. I have no opinion on whether that gets approved or not. Only thing of value to consider is that EU tends to be more strict on corporations then the US to protect consumers.

BYND Earnings AMC and Borrow Rate,"I have zero clue how they'll do. I hope well, but I have no insight. Some things which may positively impact earnings: Impossible Burger (their main competitor) had a product recall according to Pat LaFrieda, so that might help. Some people reported seeing vendors sell out of Beyond Meat, but none of the ones near me were sold out... Some things which may impact negatively: Some people reported that BYND had trouble meeting demand as their supplies were low. Again: I have NO CLUE if that is true, but it those are some of the factors that may impact the results. If supplies truly ran out, it may cause expenses to shoot up as they have to pay rush delivery to meet demand. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Estimates**

Revenue: Avg estimate is $39m with a range of $38-40m based on 8 analysts (seeking alpha is my source). Does anyone have a better source? I'd love to see it, if they do!

EPS: $(0.15) with a spread of ($0.18)-($0.12)

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if they'll provide revenue guidance but avg of 2Q19 estimates is $48.3m and avg of FY2019 estimates is $204.9m, up 133% y/y. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Updated Borrow Rate from Today:** I have seen borrow rates of 111%, but new borrow rates that S3 is quoting is 97% on existing shorts and 130-160% for new shorts. 51% of the float is short. According to S3: ""There is virtually no lendable stock left to borrow, any downward price moves in the future will be due to long selling.""

So arguably this quarter's earnings and guidance (if they provide guidance) are going to be more important than normal as this will likely be the only negative catalyst, if they miss, for the next 3 months. Because no smart money manager will want to pay an annualized borrow cost of up to 160% for a 3 month period to sit on their hands...",MikeThePutz,1559846348,30,36,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxk9xl/bynd_earnings_amc_and_borrow_rate/

Crowdstrike DD pre-IPO,"I'm thinking of placing a $20k bet on Crowdstrike's IPO next week as I believe cloud based cybersecurity overall is a strong sector for investment with increasing surface vulnerable to cyber attacks, hackers becoming increasingly sophisticated and incumbents in the sectors becoming less effective. Regarding Crowdstrike: 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Valuation:** Targeting a valuation of $3.7B to $4.5B which at the middle of the bracket would set it at a 13x ARR valuation. Which may seem high given the Bessemer's SaaS index average 10x ARR valuation but is fairly reasonable given its revenue growth of 121% YoY compared to the \~20% YoY growth of entries on this index.
   * High growth peer which include other recent IPOs such as Zoom, PagerDuty, Zscaler, Okta, MongoDB, Elastic and Coupa trade in the 20-35x which would imply  a valuation of $6.3B to $11B for Crodwstrike based on its $312.7M of ARR representing a nice upside
   * Carbon Black trades at a much lower ARR multiple (approx 5x) but analyst estimates only forecast a 15% growth YoY while crowdstrike has been growing in the triple digits
* **Large market:** TAM of $24.6 in 2019 expected to reach $29.2B for its corporate endpoint, threat intelligence, vulnerability management, managed security and service management offering
* **Competition:** Cloud-based providers such as Cylance (acquired by BB in 2019) and carbon black don't have nearly the same growth profile and visits on multiple forums can give  a glance as to why. Crowdstrike seems like a strong favorite in terms of performance, detection and response, value, implementation and management,  support and cloud features. Other competitors include legacy players such as Symantec and McAfee

Trade idea - ATVI,"
$ATVI is a steal at this level..I am going long term calls, as well as going long. Do not underestimate the recent $APPL settlement that is going to prevent apple from taking 30% of all in app purchases. Activision's mobiles games will see a big boost in revenue if that is taken down to say, 10%? Candy Crush made 1.5billion last year, think about how much that was shrunk by the 30% apple take-away. Not to mention Diablo/Cod mobile will be coming out further taking advantage of those decreased app profit takeaways. Get in early before E3 and take advantage of beaten down stock. The sector has recovered and atvi is next. It is a great opportunity to get into a leader in a constantly expanding industry with many short term and long term catalysts (particularly esports). 

This is a great value play in my mind.
I would take a look at the these calls:
Jan 15 2021 strike 50 at 5.85
Jan 15 2021 strike 55 at 4.05

Cracker Barrel DD,"Warning: This DD is based entirely on past performance.

Looking at the yearly charts, Cracker Barrel is pretty consistent in that in the span of one month, starting with a large dip, the first half it will dip anywhere from $9-20, then by the end of the month it will have recovered most of that dip and sometimes exceed it. 

Starting on May 22, Cracker Barrel has started another “large” ($12) dip. 

We are still pretty early in the start of this months dip, and this is not the type of stock to make major moves either way based on earnings which are expected 6/4. I expect this months trend to continue uninterrupted with a maximum drop of  around $20 (149) between now and June 21. I expect the stock to recover anywhere from half to the entirety of the total dip.

Beyond Meat (BYND) - My Due Diligence,"Here’s my DD for BYND over the next several months.

Short term (1-4 months) - very bullish
Mid to long term (6 months +) - very bearish

Here’s the thing. Before their IPO I didn’t even know what Beyond Meat even was. I’m a big meat guy (dislike anything related to veganism), but even for myself I’m tempted to give their “meat” a go.

There are many people out there, just like myself, who didn’t know this company even existed, but are curious to give it a try. This is possibly why many stores have sold out of all their product.

Right now the stock is trading off hype and I’m guessing the people “trying” their product will boost sales/revenues for this quarter and next. 

Essentially the IPO was free marketing. When the hype is gone the organic growth will slow down and the stock will sink.

Short Term Bullish,"  

While I maintain my long term bearish view, I have found some compelling data to suggest that there is some possible short term upside in the market. 

1. [https://imgur.com/a/eub7tPi](https://imgur.com/a/eub7tPi) The first piece of data set I am watching is the CBOE SKEW index. SKEW tracks the slope of the implied volatility curve of OTM SPX puts. Essentially it tracks the demand for protection of black swan events or tail risk hedges. Right now this index is insanely low. In the past 8 years, the index has only been this low twice, October 15 2014, and January 3rd 2019. After the first occurrence, SPY rallied more than 10% in the next 30 days and we all know what happened after January 3rd. Right now the larger players that trade SPX contracts are demanding very low amounts of downside protection.

2. [https://imgur.com/a/Yzel8Eg](https://imgur.com/a/Yzel8Eg) Next is the VIX Call/Put ratio. The 10 period moving average of the VIX C/P ratio is noticeably low and has been one of my favorite leading indicators. On may 3rd 2019 I made a comment expressing my concerns that the VIX Call/Put ratio was extremely high and that we should expect some volatility in the markets. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk04nw/what\_are\_your\_moves\_tomorrow\_may\_03/emdm7d2/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk04nw/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_may_03/emdm7d2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Needless to say that worked out pretty well. The setup isn’t as beautiful as it was then, but definitely shaping up for a short term rally.

3. [https://imgur.com/a/ZFCyv1E](https://imgur.com/a/ZFCyv1E) The spread between the DIX and GEX tracked by SqueezeMetrics is also quite significant. If you are curious about these specific indices I would recommend reading their white paper.

4. [https://imgur.com/a/ws7XXyS](https://imgur.com/a/ws7XXyS) From a TA perspective almost all of the 2 hour, 4 hour, and daily charts for SPY, IWM, and QQQ  are all showing bullish divergence on the RSI, Momentum, and PPO. This is a more subjective view so do with that what you will

5. [https://imgur.com/a/JwPL0xQ](https://imgur.com/a/JwPL0xQ) Lastly, my own model that utilizes LSTM neural networks to forecast the SPY closing prices predicted the slump we have seen the past two days and is predicting a rally closing out this week and into the next. I use the past 23 years of Closing price, RSI, and Momentum and If you are curious about the model check my comment history for information and back tests. 

With some important economic data coming out tomorrow the extremely near term outlook is unpredictable so take that into account. If GDP comes out tomorrow and it is absolute shit, then buying the dip might not be prudent. That being said, the data I am looking at point to a nice tradeable rally over the next one to two weeks. Right now I am in 6/7 282 SPY calls I bought this afternoon and will hold unless the divergence on the 4 hour chart for SPY breaks.",Nathan-T1,1559174068,844,240,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bum65c/short_term_bullish/
My take on the WDAY earnings,"Just kidding. Its more BYND due diligence from today. 

&amp;#x200B;

S3 Trading put out a report on short interest for BYND. Short Interest on the 15th of May was 39% of float and NOW stands at 51% of the float. When I call around I get borrow rates between 55-87%, but apparently S3 is reporting that new shorts are being charged 80-100%. All the more ammunition for the squeeze. This was my initial thesis and the reason why I think this is the next Tilray. Forget about fundamentals for the moment. This is a highly shorted fad stock in a ""hot"" sector with an insanely low float. THOSE are the fundamentals that matter to me.

TSLA rejiggering Fremont factory to produce Model Ys and Model S refresh,"Tesla is rejiggering its car factory in Fremont, California, to make way for production of the Model Y crossover SUV, as well as a refresh of the Model S with a more minimalist interior design and longer-range battery, according to several current and former employees.

These initiatives could raise costs again for Tesla, just as CEO Elon Musk has vowed to review every tenth page of outgoing expenses, personally. But starting up production of the Model Y in 2019 allows Tesla to tap into the growing SUV segment sooner rather than later, while a Model S refresh would help it maintain or grow its share within the declining market for luxury sedans.

The company has barely begun to place orders for new equipment to manufacture the Model Y, employees said. And while Musk has suggested that Tesla would probably make the crossover SUV in Fremont, Tesla hasn’t officially announced that preparations in the factory had begun.

Making way for Model Y production in Fremont will require Tesla to combine Model S and Model X production into one line, according to the insiders. These lines at the car plant take up a significant amount of floor space today, at least partly because the S and X are each made with a lot of parts. The Model X is particularly complicated to build — its features include falcon wing doors that open up, rather than out — leading Musk to liken it to a “Faberge egg. ”

In addition to the Model Y, Tesla is planning on a full refresh of the Model S, which employees say will likely include an interior with the minimalist look and feel of the newer Model 3, the same drive units and seats used in the higher-end Model 3 and a battery that delivers 400 miles of range on a full charge.

The company is aiming for a September start of production for that Model S refresh.

FT: Investors raise bets on Fed making two rate cuts,"Lol market is in for a shocker.

https://www.ft.com/content/5c506164-8185-11e9-9935-ad75bb96c849


Investors raise bets on Fed making two rate cuts

Investors have increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut US interest rates not once but twice this year, to counter concerns about slowing global economic growth that have been inflamed by the worsening US-China trade war.

The probability that the central bank will cut rates two or more times by the end of 2019 rose above 40 per cent on Tuesday, according to futures prices, exceeding for the first time expectations of a single cut.
The markets have been signalling a single rate cut this year for several months, even while the Fed has been keeping official policy on pause and maintained that its next move could be in either direction.

Concerns over the growth outlook have been roiling the bond market, helping push the US government’s borrowing costs lower as investors sought out the relative safety of Treasuries.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, fell as much as 6 basis points on Tuesday to 2.26 per cent, marking its lowest level since September 2017.

“The economic data continues to weaken, exacerbated by a prolonged trade war with China,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “That second rate cut is gaining traction because the market believes the economy will weaken.”

The US slapped additional tariffs on imports from China this month, and Chinese officials retaliated with measures of their own. President Donald Trump warned on Monday that US tariffs on goods from China could still “go up very, very substantially, very easily”.

The signal from the widely-watched US yield curve, whose inversion has been a reliable indicator of past recessions, also intensified investor nervousness on Tuesday, because long-dated Treasury yields slid further below yields on shorter-dated government debt.

The difference between three-month and 10-year Treasury yields dropped as low as minus-9 basis points, nearing the year to date low of minus-11 bps. This measure of the yield curve has turned negative before every US recession of the past 50 years.

Citi’s global economic surprise index, which measures whether data are coming in better or worse relative to expectations, has been in negative territory for more than a year — its longest stint below zero on record. That has led analysts to pare their forecasts for global growth this year, to a median estimate of 3.3 per cent in 2019. This would be the slowest rate of expansion since 2009.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley warned that, after adjusting for the effects of the unprecedented unwinding of the Fed’s post-financial crisis bond buying program, the yield curve has effectively been inverted since November 2018.

“We think this means the US economic slowdown and rising recession risk is happening regardless of the trade outcome,” the equity strategists, led by Michael Wilson, wrote.

The Fed has avoided any indication that cuts are coming. Minutes of its most recent meeting, held on April 30 and May 1 before the latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs were announced, suggested that there was no immediate plan to move interest rates either higher or lower. Speeches from policymakers in recent weeks have reiterated the central bank’s “patient” approach.

In spite of the Fed’s stance, investors’ are anticipating that the central bank will have to ease its monetary policy.

“One cut is likely. I would not be surprised if we see two,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “A lot of it depends on how much of a deterioration we see in the economic data. But just the breakdown in relations between the US and China is good for one rate cut.”",long_AMZN,1559108080,6,13,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/buasce/ft_investors_raise_bets_on_fed_making_two_rate/
we're fucked,"Fellow Degenerates,

As most of you (probably) know, it's looking like a recession is imminent. This is because of a few things:  
\- The trade war with China will make importing/exporting goods harder both ways (RIP the slave labor gravy train)  
\- President Donald Trump’s trade frictions are also a risk to the economy, and the Fed could potentially become too aggressive in its interest rate hikes and accidentally do the economy harm.

\- Economists also point to the “yield curve” as a sign an economic downturn is coming **—** a wonky indicator of what’s to come. As [**Robert Samuelson at the Washington Post**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-feds-crucial-choice-on-rates-this-week/2018/12/16/b72b512e-ffcc-11e8-862a-b6a6f3ce8199_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f79f253936f3) recently explained, the yield curve refers to the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates, generally on Treasury notes. Normally, long-term interest rates are higher than short-term rates, because it’s riskier for investors to lend money for longer periods of time. When short-term rates get higher than long-term rates, the yield curve becomes “inverted,” and that’s often a bad indicator. [**Every US recession**](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/el2018-07.pdf) for the past 60 years was preceded by an inverted yield curve.

\- Some (but not all) factors also [point to a potential slowdown](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/housing-market-perspectives/2018/housing-indicators-to-watch) in the housing sector.

\- The Federal Reserve can usually cut interest rates in the event of an economic downturn, but because right now they’re relatively low, the Federal Reserve has less room to maneuver. And the US already has a lot of debt, meaning there will likely be more political and economic resistance to government spending if a recession does hit. “In many ways, the recent tax cuts and spending increases have actually made it even harder for us to fight the next recession,” Goldwein said.

The question now is more of a when than if. A recession will most likely not start in 2019, but things are looking shakier as we go into 2020 and 2021. That being said, keep an eye out for other factors that could point to a recession. I know you guys don't really like this kind of stuff, but this time, it's [important](https://i.redd.it/z35ub2tl0eh11.gif). This is something that has the potential to severely damage you and your financial wellbeing. Don't be afraid to sell. As for long term investments, try to stay away for a little bit. If you're trying to make a quick buck, you can still do so - there's just much more risk. After all, there's more than plenty to gain on the ride back up after a recession. ***Just don't get yourself caught in the downturn.***

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Long term investments aren't the best idea. Hold them for now. Short-term investments are still fine - there's just more risk. Pay close attention to the market/signs and don't be afraid to pull out if you think something bad will happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, that's just my two cents. Better safe than sorry. Stay safe out there, bois.  
I'd love to see your guys' thoughts.

$AMD is running off a huge positive news catalyst that came out early this morning. $AMD will release a new Radeon RX 5700-series graphics cards in July and third-gen, Zen 2-based Epyc server chips in Q3. $INTC (Intel) also took a hit due to the fact analysts stated $AMD was going to rake in market shares. Intel might also be a dip buy in my eyes. Remember Intel is 6-10 times larger than $AMD based off their market cap and also pays a dividend, something I know investors see value in.

BYND to the mOoN MeAt!!!,"Alright- the mods deleted my last two BYND DD posts from this morning so I thought if I added a really stupid title they'll let this one go through. If you are reading this it means it worked. Here's the morning run down on BYND from today.

&amp;#x200B;

BYND blackout period for analyst coverage is over. Some thought the price targets would be horrendous since the stock is super overvalued. Turns out bankers like money (who knew?) so they aren't submarining their own successful IPO. Go figure they might want a piece of future secondaries/debt deals...

And we think Beyond’s sales ultimately could exceed $5B versus $88MM last year."" TLDR: Suck it, Citron.

Now the fun part: borrow costs from today. For those that are following my posts, I try to update the daily borrow costs from brokers so we can get a better feel on the potential timing of a short squeeze. Today the range is 55-83%. So basically unchanged from Friday. Still no shares to borrow.",MikeThePutz,1559061006,53,90,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bu240b/bynd_to_the_moon_meat/
BYND Analyst Coverage,"Clearly not as bad as some thought... 

JPMorgan initiates coverage on Beyond Meat with an Overweight rating and price target of $97.

JP's bullish rating on Beyond Meat as the quiet period expires stands in contrast to the Neutral-equivalent ratings already doled out by [BAML](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3467035-baml-cautious-beyond-meat) ($85 PT), Credit Suisse ($70 PT), Goldman Sachs ($67 PT) and Jefferies ($85 PT).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care much about fundamentals for BYND too much (I own calls for a short squeeze), but at least the analysts aren't going to tank the name with low PTs.

The History of Stock Markets," To start of the Stock Market 101 page I think that we should start with the history of Stock Markets because with an institution as old as the stock market it would be a shame to not know about their history.

If we’re talking Stock Markets we should talk about money. Before money, we used to barter for goods and services and while it worked sometimes it was a system of trade that was very inefficient. Because of this people needed to create a system of trade that was based on the goods that they sold but didn’t have the same restrictions as having to trade actual things. So we created money that was based on the value of different things, for most of history we set this value to precious metals such as gold and silver so that the currency didn’t inflate and didn’t become worthless.

Now because money isn’t an actual commodity it can be lent out and borrowed. That’s because money is simply the value of something, not actually an item. So, because of this, the first widely acknowledged brokerage began in France in the 11th century as a way to help banks manage the debts of farmers. The people who ran these were known as the courtiers of change (or exchange brokers) and effectively traded these debts between clients and each other in exchange for a small commission, essentially they were bond brokers of their time.

Around the same time, the Merchants of Venice began to dabble in the trade of government debt. Because governments need to do government things such as going to war they would need to take debts because war is expensive. Investors would buy bonds from these governments and they would trade between themselves. Eventually, this trading began to spread across Europe and eventually landed in many places but nowhere was this more popular than in Belgium. As there weren’t any official exchanges these trades would take place in coffee shops. Eventually, these coffee stores and other places of gathering became so wildly popular that these investors created their own buildings and areas for the purpose of exchanging these debts. The center for these kinds of exchanges became Antwerp, a city in the north of Belgium where exchanges were created and eventually this practice radiated outwards to other areas of Northern Europe. We still couldn’t call them stock markets/exchanges because stocks didn’t exist at that point.

Stocks came to existence for one reason, risk. The Netherlands at the time was basically a merchant republic, and therefore a center of trade, and because of this a lot of these bonds were exchanged for and traveled through the area. The Dutch East India Company was a trading company that wanted to be part of the very profitable spice and silk trade, but it was a risky venture. Most of the ships that would go on the voyage wouldn’t come back creating a situation with a lot of risks and a lot of rewards. As a result, the Company looked around them, and at the government practice of selling debt in order to finance risky projects and decided to do the same. They would sell debt in their company for a percentage of profits in their ventures. And that’s how the first publicly traded company was made. They needed a place to trade these shares and for that reason, the first stock market was created. It was a place to trade shares for ships within the Dutch East India Company.

Investor patience has worn thin at the German lender—shares hit a record low yesterday, having fallen 41% in a year.

But like Bill Belichick, DB’s execs are taking it day by day. CEO Christian Sewing said yesterday DB is focused on “profitable and growing businesses” and is “prepared to make tough cutbacks.”

## One possible place for cuts?

Workers have since bet big on futures for those cardboard boxes they give you when you get laid off.

* Sewing has started to zero in on high-margin businesses like DB’s transaction bank, to which execs had “frequently paid too little attention.”
* There's also its asset management biz DWS, which Sewing wants to turn into a top 10 global asset manager.

Also...

* Trump sued the bank last month to block it from following orders to give lawmakers info on Trump’s finances.
* This week, DB got the go-ahead from a federal judge to do just that.

* This isn’t the first time the administration has helped farmers struggling to overcome retaliatory Chinese tariffs; the USDA [offered farmers](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/16989140.93534/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV1dGVycy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS91cy11c2EtdHJhZGUtZmFybWVycy1mYWN0Ym94L2ZhY3Rib3gtdXNkYXMtMTItYmlsbGlvbi1mYXJtZXItcmVsaWVmLXBhY2thZ2UtaWRVU0tCTjFLRjA1Mz91dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/5cc0df73fc942d798806d3baBcd313eaa) $12 billion in aid last July to help deal with trauma from the trade war and from watching *Sharp Objects*.

**The hardest of passes:** Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said no more meetings with China were on the schedule and advised American businesses to adjust their supply chains accordingly.  

**Looking ahead...**American farmers have other problems besides the trade war. The past 12 months were the [wettest on record](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/16989140.93534/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yYmVzLmNvbS9zaXRlcy9tYXJzaGFsbHNoZXBoZXJkLzIwMTkvMDUvMTkvd2h5LXRoZS11LXMtanVzdC1oYWQtaXRzLXdldHRlc3QtMTItbW9udGgtc3RyZXRjaC1vbi1yZWNvcmQvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/5cc0df73fc942d798806d3baB7ca5614f) in the contiguous U.S., according to NOAA. That’s delayed planting and raised costs.

 

On Tuesday, Governor Jay Inslee of Washington State [signed a bill](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/16989140.93534/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmF0aW9uL2xhLW5hLWh1bWFuLWNvbXBvc3RpbmctaW5zbGVlLTIwMTkwNTIxLXN0b3J5Lmh0bWw_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/5cc0df73fc942d798806d3baB84756711) that legalized “aboveground decomposition” as an option for disposing of human remains. In other words, in Washington, you can compost your corpse.

A startup called Recompose was the law’s chief backer and will be the first to take advantage. It plans to offer a service in which bodies are placed in steel containers for a month, while microbes turn them into loam.

**But...why?**

Casket burial takes up a lot of land, and cremation spews greenhouse gases. Recompose says the soil option will cost [about $5,000](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/16989140.93534/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAxOS8wNS8yMi91cy9odW1hbi1jb21wb3N0aW5nLXdhc2hpbmd0b24uaHRtbD91dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/5cc0df73fc942d798806d3baB6a936aa3)—cheaper than traditional burial, but a bit pricier than cremation.

Recomposition has one major detractor: the Catholic Church, which says recomposition disrespects human life. Spade’s response? “For anyone thinking about their end of life options, it’s all about choice, not taking away choices.”

Mega-autistic DD," 

This is too big to post in the Tesla megathread, so hopefully the mods can supress their gayness for a second and not remove this.  

I’ll start off by saying I never played TSLA, as I always thought it was retardedly overhyped and just overall unpredictable af. But I can’t ignore what I’m seeing, an opportunity to make fat stacks.

TL;DR: Doesn’t matter if you hate Tesla to death or would fondle Elon’s balls with your tongue, doesn’t matter if you think it’s gonna go to 0 or $500b, you should think about playing it, short term this shit’s about to launch another TSLA to space. June $40 puts are retarded.

TSLA, the stats:

Shares outstanding: 176.77M – 34.07B mkt cap @ yesterday’s close

Shares free float: 126.83M – 24.44B mkt cap @ yesterday’s close

Went down another \~4% pre-market, to \~$185/share

3-month average daily volume: 10.83M shares / day

Yesterday’s volume: 18.69M shares / day

4/30/2019 short data:

Short days to cover: 3.1

Short % of float: 29.90%

Shares short: 37.925M

Estimated short volume @ yesterday’s close: 57M shares - 45% float shorted

Short availability data from Interactive Brokers, in number of shortable shares:

2019.04.14 TSLA|TESLA INC|700,000

2019.04.15 TSLA|TESLA INC|800,000

2019.05.02 TSLA|TESLA INC|450,000

2019.05.22 @ 18:00:03 TSLA|TESLA INC|75,000

2019.05.23 @ 06:30:02 TSLA|TESLA INC|200,000

2019.05.23 @ 06:45:03 TSLA|TESLA INC|250,000

2019.05.23 @ 07:00:03 TSLA|TESLA INC|250,000

2019.05.23 @ 07:30:02 TSLA|TESLA INC|100,000

What does the move from 75k availability to 250k this early morning, and back to 100k later this morning? It’s the first wave of shorts covering, and the second wave shorting. Translation for you autists, smart money covered, dumb money is now shorting.

Options volume &amp; Max pain (Friday exp):

Top call strikes:

\* 200 – 18.5k vol

\* 205 – 16k vol

\* 210 – 11k vol

Top put strikes:

\* 190 – 17.3k

\* 195 - 11k

\* 200 – 10.8k

Max pain $205

September 2019 max pain $255

40.000 puts with strike over $200 expiring this Friday. That’s 4M shares to be assigned. Even though some of those are spreads, are there enough shares available to be assigned short for the nakeds, or will put holders need to buy? You decide!

Looking at retail buying trends on Robinhood (info via https://robintrack.net/symbol/TSLA):

1st January 2019: 81,923 TSLA holders on RH

15th April 2019: 131,983 TSLA holders on RH

13th May 2019: 146,812 TSLA holders on RH

23rd May 2019 (yesterday): 156,175 TSLA holders on RH

Assuming the average TSLA holder on RH holds 10 shares, that’s 1.56M TSLA shares held on RH, or 1.2% of float. On RH, the buttcrack of stock brokers! That’s insane. And I think assuming 10 shares / holder is an underestimation. While many may have just 1-2 shares, there’s plenty of “whales” that hold a lot more, including many that hold TSLA for selling covered calls, so a minimum 100 shares.  

10 shares / holder avg = 1.2% of float

20 shares / holder avg = 2.4% of float

50 shares / holder  avg = 6% of float

Absolutely bonkers! I also estimate that around 80,000 of the RH holders bought at prices under $190 / share. Use the retail HODLERS to your advantage.

Things to keep in mind:

\* Due to the sudden drop, a lot of put sellers will be assigned shares that they have to get rid of, potentially further tanking the price short-term

\* Elon’s wink tweet yesterday &amp; general propensity to fuck around ala “420 funding secured”. I don’t know what bullshit he’ll pull out of his ass this time, but ask yourself if you really think he’s not going to try to pull something.

\* Elon owns about 50% of the $30b SpaceX, which could potentially be used to bailout Tesla if needed (as per the leaked Morgan Stanley call)

\* Tesla still has $4B in cash on hand. Even if they’re gonna go bust, don’t be fooled into thinking it’s going bust next week and take advantage of the panic &amp; FOMO.

\* Look into the institutional holders. Who is holding TSLA? Think about who would sell &amp; who wouldn’t.

One last juicy bit: I’ve heard some faint whispers that both Berkshire as well as Bezos are getting involved, Warren taking a stake in Tesla &amp; Bezos about getting a partnership agreement to supply some tech to one of his other ventures (that I don’t know anything about). I’m working hard to get some more info on this, but for now, you really should treat this as bullshit I pulled out of my ass. But if you think about it, it does sound like it could be legit. Just think about how &amp; what Buffer OG likes to yolo.

I’ll leave you with this bit (from this article https://theweek.com/articles/459166/how-warren-buffett-made-10-billion-during-financial-crisis):

\&gt; “The deals Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway made from2008 to 2011 involved giant, blue-chip companies like Mars, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Dow Chemical.Taking advantage of the general atmosphere of panic, Berkshire Hathaway was able to use its""gigantic cash hoard to move swiftly and exact lucrative terms that created a stream of payments from the borrowers,"" says the Journal. For example, Buffett pumped $5 billion into Goldman Sachs shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, a massive boost of confidence in Goldman that shored up its stock price. Buffett bought $5 billion in preferred shares, and as part of the deal won warrants for an additional $5 billion worth of common shares. Which brings us to the real key to Buffett's success: Being Warren Buffett. When you've got the Midas touch, nearly every deal you make boosts investor confidence in the company in question, turning its success into a self-fulfilling prophecy.”

* Deliveries in North America during Q1 will be lower than the prior quarter as we start delivering cars in Europe and China for the first time. As a result of the start of Model 3 expansion into Europe and China, deliveries will be lower than production by about 10,000 units due to vehicle transit times to these markets.
* Target a 25% Model 3 non-GAAP gross margin at some point in 2019.
* Energy generation and storage revenue should increase significantly in 2019, mainly due to the storage business.
* Operating expenses will grow by less than 10% in 2019, thus creating massive leverage given the top line growth in 2019.
* Restructuring actions taken in Q1 will reduce our costs by about $400 million annually.
* Q1 financials will reflect a one-time restructuring cost.
* The gap between production and deliveries in Q1 will create a temporary but predictable dip in our revenues and earnings.
* Target is to achieve a very small GAAP net income in Q1.
* The higher in-transit inventory will also negatively impact operating cash flows in Q1.
* Deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019.
* Capital expenditure is expected to be about $2.5 billion.

[Tesla adjusts Autopilot to comply with new EU regulations | May 17 2019](https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/17/tesla-updates-autopilot-europe/)

Tesla will push an updated Autopilot in Europe that scales back on a couple of functions in order to comply with new regulations. The changes will require faster lane changes and limit how far you can turn the steering wheel on Autosteer. Electrek reports that while Tesla's Autopilot was approved under older rules, it had to be dialed back in order to comply with the new UN/ECE R79 regulation on driver assistance systems. The update only impacts Model S and Model X vehicles; Model 3 already complies with the new rules.

[How Tesla plans to cut customers’ insurance costs: Tap into Autopilot | May 13 2019](https://www.autonews.com/finance-insurance/how-tesla-plans-cut-customers-insurance-costs-tap-autopilot)

Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk is turning to the insurance business in an attempt to achieve what the automaker has so far struggled with on the vehicle pricing front: lower costs for customers. Tesla says it will start offering insurance this month that taps internal data from the AutoPilot driver-assist system to reduce rates. Musk, on Tesla's first-quarter earnings call, said the product would ""be much more compelling than anything else out there.""

[More Advanced Safety for Tesla Owners | May 2, 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/more-advanced-safety-tesla-owners)

The massive amount of real-world data gathered from our cars’ eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar, coupled with billions of miles of inputs from real drivers, helps us better understand the patterns to watch out for in the moments before a crash. As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That’s because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we’re introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features – Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance – help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.

[Elon Musk Makes $500 Billion Autonomy Pitch to Investors | May 2 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-02/musk-is-said-to-make-500-billion-autonomy-pitch-to-investors)

The chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a “half-trillion dollar market cap company,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn’t open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.

[Tesla delays electric semi truck production to next year | Apr 25th 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/04/25/tesla-semi-delay-electric-truck-production-next-year/)

During its first quarter 2019 earnings call last night, Tesla confirmed that it is delaying the production of Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck program, to next year. The executive also said that they are currently testing the electric trucks with maximum loads and that they are making improvements to the design. Musk previously said that Tesla aims to manufacture 100,000 electric trucks per year. Over the past two years, Tesla has been taking reservations for the electric truck and said that the production versions will have 300-mile and 500-mile range versions for $150,000 and $180,000 respectively.

[The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther | April 23 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther)

Beginning today, Model S and Model X now come with an all-new drivetrain design that increases each vehicle’s range substantially, achieving a landmark 370 miles and 325 miles on the EPA cycle for Model S and Model X Long Range, respectively. Using the same 100 kWh battery pack, these design and architecture updates will allow drivers to travel farther than ever before, charging less frequently and getting more range out of every dollar spent on charging. We’re also introducing a brand-new adaptive suspension system for Model S and Model X, along with a few other improvements for the best range, acceleration, and ride comfort ever, plus a Ludicrous Mode upgrade for our most loyal customers.

Tesla vehicles will likely be better at driving than humans by the end of 2019, CEO Elon Musk said in an interview with MIT research scientist Lex Fridman. ""I think it will become very quickly — maybe even towards the end of this year, but I would say I'd be shocked if it's not next year, at the latest — that having a human intervene will decrease safety,"" Musk said. Musk later said that Tesla's autonomous-driving technology was improving at an exponential rate, and that it seemed to him that the company is ahead of its competitors in the autonomous-driving industry.

Of course, we need some context here to explain what Musk is referring to, so here's the tweets:@RamLover69 You would still be physically fatigued if you tried to haul 12,000 lbs of steel beams like I do every day with my Dodge Ram, 2019s motor trend truck of the year.@elonmusk 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children’s toys?It's not a secret that Tesla is working on an electric pickup truck. In fact, it's scheduled to be revealed sometime later this year. As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with ""crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard,"" noted Musk in a previous tweet. We suspect that whatever a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150 can do, Tesla will one-up those figures.

Elon Musk isn’t giving up on bringing Tesla Inc. to India. “Would love to be there this year.

The specs weren’t much of a surprise either: the long-range Model Y has a range of 300 miles and seating for seven. A performance version of the vehicle is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. “It has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,” Musk said. “So this thing will be really tight on corners.” The $47,000 long-range Model Y will come first in the fall of 2020, and it will have a range of 300 miles, Musk said. Tesla will also sell an all-wheel drive dual-motor version for $51,000 and a performance version for $60,000 — both of which will be available in fall 2020. The cheaper, standard range version with a range of 230 miles won’t be available until 2021, Musk said. It will sell for $39,000.

[Introducing V3 Supercharging | March 6 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)

Tesla has more than 12,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia and our network continues to grow daily: more than 99% of the U.S. population is covered by the network, and we anticipate similar coverage in Europe by the end of 2019. Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we’re announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.

[Tesla’s Model 3 was the best-selling EV in the world last year | Feb 22 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236707/tesla-model-3-2018-best-selling-ev-global)

The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.

[Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)

According to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017— and that doesn’t even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it’s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a “Standby” state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car’s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alert” state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alarm” state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car’s audio system. If a car switches to “Alarm” state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They’ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.

$AOS US Company with Chinese Funny Money,"**Intro**

At first glance, AOS looks like a pretty boring member of the S&amp;P 500 that produces water heaters primarily in the US  [https://www.aosmith.com/](https://www.aosmith.com/) (Probably lost half of you here).  What they're doing in China and India is where it gets juicy.  

**J Capital Short**

J Capital specializes in primary research in China into companies with dubious numbers and aims to profit off of their decline. They conduct Chinese macro search as well as deep dives into individual companies and industry reports. Last Thursday, they released a 66-page report on $AOS (front page of [https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/](https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/) ), leading to a $4 contraction in share price Thursday and eventually a low of $40.34 in the following week. It's 66 pages so I'll condense it to eight points:

1. Management Incompetence
2. Partnership with UTP to hide losses, report artificially high China numbers, and high amount of AOS's cash, 84%, tied up in China with many defaulting distributors
3. Decline in China Revenues related to new market entrants
4. China counterparts trading at much lower multiples than China portion of AOS valuation
5. Loss of direct sales to online sales in China
6. Trade War headwinds related to China 
7. Slower domestic growth related to slowdown in US housing
8. Murky Accounting Entries related to China

Their founder, Jay Axler, got pushed out of IB in the financial crisis and decided to rage against the machine by shorting companies, to a ton of success.  Their Twitter ( [https://twitter.com/sprucepointcap](https://twitter.com/sprucepointcap)) contains all of his coverage on $AOS at the moment but I'll include some of his points not already covered by J Capital.

1. $AOS growth has primarily come from China. Spinning their slowdown in China to macro concerns when it is really competition in the sector.
2. Omission of China disclosures in recent financial reports
3. Move of $AOS holders from fundamental investors to passive vehicles, quant funds etc.
4. Recent acquisitions sign of lack of confidence in Chinese business
5. Losing money in India even after 10 years, auditors citing insufficient quantitative details about fixed assets
6. Evidence of sandbagging revenues and then later revising revenues higher
7. Gross margins and EBITDA margins substantially higher than similar competitors that have seen a contraction in margins related to an increase in the cost of inputs
8. China Capex consistently underestimated
9. CFO resigning amid China revenue revisions
10. High Price-Target regional banks with little-to-no Chinese presence
11. Smith family controls 2/3 of board and majority of voting power; insiders own only 1.7% of shares

tldr: *Current $AOS price:* $44.60 *SPC Low PT:*$17.71 *SPC High PT: 27.27*

**Risks I See:** Not a ton of negative catalysts in near-term, could see quants and other passive funds picking up $AOS following contractions. Trade War end could mean surge upward for $AOS. 

**Short Interest:** Short interest currently 3.68% of float, according to  [http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AOS.htm](http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AOS.htm). This also lists insider ownership as .9%.

[Square Spends $20 to Acquire Each New Cash App User | May 16, 2019](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-spends-20-acquire-cash-143000656.html)

Square's (NYSE: SQ) Cash App has grown to become a meaningful contributor to the company's top-line growth. The peer-to-peer payments app turned financial multitool is the No. 1 driver of its subscription and services segment, management said at the J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference. During that conference, CFO Amrita Ahuja noted the company's per-customer acquisition cost for Cash App is about $20. That's actually quite low relative to other financial services, and even compared to other apps.

[Square's Bitcoin Platform Remains Surprisingly Profitable | May 7, 2019](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-apos-bitcoin-platform-remains-230000557.html)

Square's bitcoin revenue accounted for 6.8% of its net revenue during the first quarter, compared to 5.1% in the prior year quarter. However, Square's bitcoin profits only accounted for about 0.2% of its gross profit during the quarter, versus less than 0.1% a year earlier. Square's bitcoin business won't move the needle anytime soon, but its top and bottom line growth is impressive, especially since bitcoin shed roughly 40% of its value over the past 12 months. If bitcoin's price rises again and it attracts more buyers, Square's bitcoin revenue and gross profits could surge much higher.

Instead of viewing Square's bitcoin platform as a separate business, investors should see it as part of the company's long-term plan to lock users into its Cash App. Cash is one of the top peer-to-peer payment apps in the U.S. alongside PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL) Venmo and the bank-based Zelle, and it's still growing rapidly. Last quarter Square stated that its Cash App payment volume rose nearly 2.5 times annually. For comparison, PayPal stated that Venmo's payment volume rose 73% annually in its most recent quarter.

Square makes money from Cash App by charging businesses transaction fees for using its software. For a 1.5% transaction fee, individual users can expedite deposits to have them transferred immediately into their bank accounts instead of waiting the standard deposit time. They can also send personal payments from credit cards for a 3% transaction fee.

[Why Square Is Hiring Cryptocurrency Experts | April 3, 2019](https://marketrealist.com/2019/04/why-square-is-hiring-cryptocurrency-experts/)

Square (SQ) has announced a plan to hire several cryptocurrency experts. Square’s crypto team will work on an open-source initiative as part of the company’s contribution to the development of a cryptocurrency ecosystem. Although Square says the crypto team it’s planning to create won’t focus on its commercial interests, the company still stands to benefit if the team’s efforts lead to the broader uptake of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Square operates a cryptocurrency exchange that allows users of its Cash App to buy and sell Bitcoin. In the fourth quarter, Square’s Bitcoin business generated $52.4 million in revenue, up from $43 million in the third quarter. Square is already making a small profit from its Bitcoin business even though the overall business is still seeing losses.

Square has partnered with the Nationals to create a concession stand that offers the only skip-the-line, order-ahead experience in the ballpark, powered by Caviar Pickup. Fans who open the Caviar app from their seats will be able to order their concessions in advance – including beer and wine for fans 21 and over – and receive an alert when their food is ready to be picked up. The stand will feature food from exclusive Caviar restaurant partners, featured in a rotating series of pop-ups throughout the season. On Opening Day, fans will be able to enjoy Hong Kong-style Chinese food from Tiger Fork, with future food options including biscuits from Mason Dixie and ramen from Toki Underground. Square Terminal, the handheld, all-in-one payment processing hardware device, will also be piloted by roving concessions hawkers at Nationals Park. Square Terminal will allow fans to pay using credit cards or contactless payments like Apple Pay or Google Pay as they purchase food and beverage items from the comfort of their seats. With Square’s point of sale and employee management software built right into Square Terminal, it’s easy for hawkers to quickly accept payments. Square Terminal will help fans who don’t carry cash, and will speed transaction times as hawkers spend less time counting change and more time making sales.

TSLA Time to tighten the old belt...,"I love the company and its mission- but they legit might go bust before someone bigger buys off the pieces for pennies. 

From: Elon Musk

To: Everybody

Date: May 16, 2019

As mentioned at the company talk, it is extremely important that we examine every expenditure at Tesla no matter how small, and be sure that it is critical.

When making hundreds of thousands of cars, battery packs and solar systems, even a ten cent savings could be worth over $50,000 a year. There are over 10,000 unique parts and processes at Tesla, so making small improvements across the board has a giant cumulative impact.

At the same time, we must also continue to make our products subtly better in thousands of small ways.

It is important to bear in mind that we lost $700 million in the first quarter this year, which is over $200 million per month. Investors nonetheless were supportive of our efforts and agreed to give us $2.4 billion (our net proceeds) to show that we can be financially sustainable.

That is a lot of money, but actually only gives us approximately ten months at the first-quarter burn rate to achieve breakeven. It’s vital that we respect the faith investors have shown in Tesla, but it will require great effort to do so.

That is why, going forward, all expenses of any kind anywhere in the world, including parts, salary, travel expenses, rent, literally every payment that leaves our bank account must be reviewed, confirmed as critical and the top of every page of outgoing payments signed by our CFO.

I will personally review and sign every 10th page.

Please examine closely every expense where responsibility is, or probably should be, assigned to your group. If in doubt, assume it is on your plate, so that we don’t have anything slip through the cracks.

This will take at least a few weeks to get right. Please don’t worry if it isn’t correct at first.

This is hardcore, but it is the only way for Tesla to become financially sustainable and succeed in our goal of helping make the world environmentally sustainable.

Thanks again for your excellent work,

Impossible Burger Recall as it relates to BYND,"Alright- one more post on BYND. Sorry for boring everyone. For those that didn't catch CNBC this morning, they had Pat LaFrieda on. They are meat purveyors that supply many michelin star rated restaurants, Shake Shak, and others. I think they have $200m in annual revenue? Anyway, for meat alternatives, LaFrieda buys from Impossible Meats. Apparently in March, Impossible Meats had a voluntary recall due to a customer finding plastic in the meat. Whatever. This is old news. However- Lafrieda mentioned that since the recall, many of Impossible Meats' customers needed supplies of meat-alternative and turned to Beyond Meat: Including LaFrieda. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I don't know if it will be a long lasting switch... Maybe some customers will be more comfortable with BYND's ability to supply vs. Impossible Meats? But I think this could positively affect BYND's first earnings report out of the gate and maybe boost guidance. In their S1 they gave preliminary figures for 1Q19 of $38-40m in revenue. I don't know when they will report, unfortunately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, Impossible Meats raised $300m privately and says they have no desire to go public soon. Good for BYND since it remains the only publicly-traded pure play on meat alternative.

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly: I'm sure you all saw yesterday that Tim Horton's is testing BYND's sausage. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly: We finally got info on % of float being short. It is about 1/3 of the 10m flat being short and borrow rates are between 37% - 60% based on the broker.

"Long Naspers, Short Tencent for ""Risk-free"" gains","Most of you have heard of Tencent (TCEHY) but probably not Naspers (NPSNY). Naspers is not well known and appears to be significantly mispriced. I (and many others) think there is a truly ""risk-free"" play here. I put that in quotes because you shouldn't take my word at face value. I'm just some guy on reddit. Do some DD of your own. Or don't. It's your money - I'm just hoping to shine some light on how to turn it into more money.

The case for Naspers is as follows: 

* Naspers (NPSNY) is basically a VC of sorts, based out of South Africa
* They invest primarily in tech and have stakes in a lot of [companies](https://www.naspers.com/companies)
* Their biggest and most important stake is in Tencent. They own 31.2% of Tencent.
* Tencent market cap at this time is $450B making the value of Naspers holdings worth around $140B
* Naspers market cap is only $100B. Based on the Tencent holding alone, they are trading at a $40B discount.
* Naspers also has large stakes in a couple dozen other tech companies that are fairly well known, such as [mail.ru](https://mail.ru). So unless these holdings are collectively worth less than $0 (spoiler: they aren't), there's no good reason for this discount. 

You could just stop reading here and long Naspers, and that would be a good play. 

But I think the better play is to bet that the discount between Naspers market cap and their Tencent holding will eventually close. And so the ""risk-free"" play is as follows:

* Long NPSNY
* Short TCEHY

As the gap in valuation closes, you should profit on both sides. The only risk to you is if the gap widens. There's no real reason the gap should widen but this is current year and I've seen crazier things happen.",RybosWorld,1558018765,0,11,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpdldq/long_naspers_short_tencent_for_riskfree_gains/

# VU discovers megaleak in Intel chips

Thanks to a mistake, the VU uncovered a mega breach in Intel chips. Intel pays the price for a fast but risky design.

The news in brief:

* **Researchers from the VU University Amsterdam have found an extensive data breach that is present in all Intel processors. These chips are in more than 80 percent of all computers and servers.**
* **On Tuesday evening, Intel and VU announced the details of RIDL (Rogue In-Flight Data Load), a vulnerability that allows malicious parties to ""steal almost all data"" from computers. Unauthorized persons can view the data that the processor is currently processing.**
* **The vulnerability is in all Intel processors of the last ten years - including the very latest. Hackers can exploit the vulnerability by hiding code in a web advertisement.**

Two rack cabinets from the Ikea full of computer walls, a jumble of cables and a stack of second-hand processors. It is not immediately the test lab that you expect from which VU University researchers uncovered the sophisticated, super-complex leak in recent months.

Here, in room P455, on the fourth floor of the W&amp;N building in Amsterdam, it was demonstrated that all Intel processors of the past ten years are susceptible to a major leak. This means that more than 80 percent of all computers in the world are susceptible to an attack that gives access to data at the heart of the computer.

RIDL, as the new vulnerability was baptized, came to light by chance. On Tuesday 11 September, Stephan van Schaijk, Computer Science student at VU University Amsterdam, worked on his study assignment: investigating a leak in the Intel processor.

Van Schaijk: „I was busy for an hour but did not advance. I adjusted something in my code and then I saw something strange appear on the screen. Values ​​I did not expect. ""

Van Schaijk had made a mistake, a bug in a bug, with which he could suddenly watch what happened in another program. It was a bigger and more serious leak than he was actually looking for.

His colleagues and teachers were just as surprised. Together, they wrote more than 20 ""exploits"" attack scenarios in a short time that would allow hackers to take control of the computer.

One of those tricks: by logging in with an incorrect password, the attacker forces the computer to compare the wrong password with the correct password. This data runs through the 'pipelines' of the chip and can be intercepted, after which the hacker can retrieve the correct password after some tinkering. ""You find fragments. As if you are going to get a paper document through the shredder and then reassemble the shreds, ”says Herbert Bos, professor of system and network security at the VU.

Stephan van Schaijk was sent out to buy as many different processors as possible, to see if they were all vulnerable.

And that was true. Even the oldest one, from 2008, that was picked up via Marktplaats, turned out to be vulnerable to RIDL, or Rogue In-Flight Data Load. And so, Intel was immediately warned.

A beer please

It is not the first time that Intel gets into trouble with a leak in its processors. The chip is extra fast because it is ahead of things: each time the processor speculates which data is probably needed next. This presents risks because computer processes do not remain well separated from each other.

Assistant professor Kaveh Razavi compares it to a café: the processor works like a waitress who assumes that you want to drink the same as the one before you. The glass is poured automatically without the waitress checking whether you can have that beer.

The solution: the tray must be emptied after every order. That makes the processor slower. Depending on the programs you use, the speed difference can be considerable, the researchers expect. That explains why Intel has been struggling so long to fix this leak.

RIDL cuts right through all existing security layers. This applies to the data centers where virtual systems often run on the same server. The encrypted environment that Intel devised for business customers is also vulnerable.

Premium with aftertaste

Although parts of the leak were found by several researchers from different universities and companies, the VU has discovered the majority. Amsterdam University is also the only party to receive a reward: $100,000 (89,000 euros), Intel's maximum reward for discoverers of critical leaks.

There is a small taste to the premium. **According to the VU, Intel tried to downplay the severity of the leak by officially paying $40,000 in reward and ""$80,000"" in addition. That offer was politely refused.**

Anyone who accepts a reward must also adhere to the rules. In this case, that meant: no consultation between researchers and uncertainty about which software manufacturers were warned in advance. According to the researchers, tech companies do not reason in the interests of the user, but of the shareholder.

Intel initially failed to notify Google and Mozilla, two major browser manufacturers.

The VU tried to force the manufacturer to come out faster. Eventually the VU forced Intel to come out in May - otherwise the university would publish the details itself. ""**If it were up to Intel, they would have wanted to wait another six months**,"" says Bos.

Intel had promised that the next generation of chips would not be vulnerable to RIDL, but that is not the case.

Hackers usually anticipate software vulnerabilities. Undiscovered holes (zero days) in important programs are sold for a lot of money in the black circuit. But after Specter and Meltdown, two fundamental holes that were previously found in Intel chips, both the ethical computer experts and the criminal figures are pointing their hardware. ""Processors have become so complex that chip makers no longer have security under control,"" said Bos.

And what should you do as a computer user? Update, update and update again. It is expected that all major software manufacturers will close the gap or have already closed the latest releases. It's not for nothing that RIDL comes out on Patch Tuesday, the monthly update day from Microsoft.

Intel ZombieLoad flaw forces OS patches with up to 40% performance hits,"Intel ZombieLoad flaw forces OS patches with up to 40% performance hits

When security researchers disclosed a series of major vulnerabilities impacting Intel processors back in January 2018, it was clear that “Meltdown” and “Spectre” were indeed serious — and wouldn’t be the only exploits of multi-threading chips. Now a new Intel chip vulnerability nicknamed “ZombieLoad” has been revealed to the public, and though it’s already being patched by three major operating system makers, there’s some bad news: full protection could reduce your CPU’s performance by up to 40%.
In a just-published support document, Apple suggests that full ZombieLoad mitigation will require Intel chip users to disable Intel’s hyper-threading processing feature — a major selling point of the chipmaker’s CPUs. During testing this month, Apple says that it found “as much as a 40 percent reduction in performance with tests that include multithreaded workloads and public benchmarks,” though actual performance impacts will vary between machines.
Google and Microsoft (via TechCrunch) have also started the process of patching their Intel-based operating systems. In Google’s case, Chrome OS devices have already received some protections and will receive more in the next OS release; Intel-only Android devices are rare, but will receive OS patches once device makers deploy them. Microsoft is releasing patches for Windows today, and has already protected Azure users. Some microcode processor updates will come from Microsoft directly, and others from device makers.
The ZombieLoad issue was apparently disclosed to Intel one month ago, and impacts all Intel processors produced since 2011. Chips from AMD and ARM are not believed to be susceptible to this flaw. According to vendors, there are no known real-world exploits of the vulnerability at this point, though the researchers simply say that they don’t know if it’s been abused in the wild.

Quick BYND DD: Let's see if the numbers are reasonable.,"As we probably all know this company called BYND sells a veggie burger that allegedly tastes pretty good.

Frankly selling a Seitan or Tofu alternative is nice, but the real cash moneyness of this stock is based on whether we think it can disrupt beef and to what extent. (If it can't, it's overvalued.) In theory a plant-based product can be produced for cheaper than real meat, and in fact, become tastier over time, since it is not constrained by things like, having to have functional proteins. Based on BYND's track record, this leads us *a priori* to anticipate an enormous potential opportunity. However the valuation is equally enormous, so we have to take a look at the numbers.

In 2019 the average American is anticipated to consume 57lb of beef. The average selling price at the slaughterhouse for beef is anticipated to be around $50 per hundredweight. Some simple math gives us a TAM of $9B in annual revenue.

That's pretty frickin' enormous compared to the current market cap of $4.5B but in all fairness it's not going to replace anywhere close to 100% of beef... yet. 

In a few years if you're betting they can snag 10% of the beef market, you should be long here. If not, then you should probably not be long. (That would be a several year forward P/S of around 5, these are very rough and dirty calculations.) I don't think that's entirely unreasonable given that they are rolling out probably soon to all major chains, have a product that is both premium(in terms of the ""feel good effect""-- which is VERY real), comparably tasty to real beef burgers, and miles ahead, at least several years ahead, of the competition.

Take a company like JUUL-- very successful, very innovative, large market, valued at $28B. However, their signature product is a battery in a fucking dick stick. What BYND has done is much more technologically difficult and significant, has a larger total addressable market, but otherwise is a pretty good comparison--ie it's a healthy, premium if you like, alternative to a very old industry.

This is a race to economies of scale where BYND has a significant R&amp;D advantage. And a significant cost structure advantage over a VAST industry, called the motherfucking goddamn BEEF industry, that has been around for literally fucking thousands of years since the Sumerians first decided to keep their sacred animal in a fence so they could jerk off while looking directly into his eyes and gaining his energy.

Tendie kisses 1,"This week, someone on this sub got sand in his vagina over a shitpost I made and challenged me to post some real DD. So here it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I may do these every Sunday, or this may be the first and last.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't fuck with options like some of you retards, just stocks for now. I'm also not autistic enough to day trade. I have a real job and social obligations (in case you're wondering, cry-shouting at your mum because she hasn't cleaned your CPAP machine doesn't count as socialising). So I stick to stocks and typically pick some on Sunday then close positions throughout the following week or the one after.

&amp;#x200B;

I usually focus on companies with market caps between 100M and 1 Bn, because they're more interesting and often volatile. I'm also bored of the same old $AAPL, $SNAP, $LYFT, $BABA, $MSFT ad nauseum circle-jerk. I like penny stocks if they poke their heads into dollar territory and I can see a good opportunity to brown bear dick them back down into oblivion. bear gang for life.

&amp;#x200B;

So, without further ado - here are my top 3 picks for the coming week, complete with big swinging DDs:

&amp;#x200B;

**$WKHS (BEAR - short term)**

&amp;#x200B;

I posted about this [earlier in the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmcyww/wkhs_penny_stock_up_200_today_because_of_a_trump/) and was completely ignored. Really hurt my feelings you guys, but because I love you i'm going to give you all a second run at the tendies. TL;DR is that this week Trump tweeted about Workhorse buying a vacant plant from $GM in Ohio, which pushed their stock price out of the pennies and over $2 in a few hours, based on absolutely nothing. From what I can see, Workhorse are a failing electric truck manufacturer trying to dig themselves out of a money hole by borrowing even more money and spending it stupidly. Trump made a big deal about the sale because it's Ohio and he wants to take credit for every job created there. Turns out the United Auto Workers (UAW) don't want the deal to go through and GM are contractually prohibited from closing or selling the plant until its current labour deal with the UAW expires in September. Plus Workhorse might not even have the money to buy the plant. All in all, a bunch of all caps hot air from Teflon Don. BUT... you didn't miss out on all the tendies. At $1.82 $WKHS is still an overweight date and dying for a dicking back into the pennies. I'm expecting a sharp sell off on Monday and will hopefully be closing by Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on how big a train the markets run on her.

&amp;#x200B;

1 caveat:

&amp;#x200B;

Workhorse are currently through to the final stage of a USPS competition to replace their old fleet of postal delivery vehicles. The winner should be announced very soon (maybe as soon as this week, since it's been delayed since 2018). If Workhorse win the contract, it'll be worth $6 Bn+ and absolutely rape my position. Competition is stiff, but I'm discounting everyone except for AM General and Workhorse. AM General are my favourites because they have the relationship with the federal government and the capacity / expertise to get the job done. Except for Workhorse and Oshkosh/Ford, all other competitors are foreign (Indian and Turkish). No way Teflon Don is giving this business to ~~ragheads~~ a non-US company this close to an election (MAGA). I'm discounting Ford because their design looks like dog shit and the proposed plant isn't in a swing state. As I said above, Workhorse are in Ohio. AM General are in Southbend, Indiana, another swing state. So, to my mind, Trump's **rational** play is to push USPS to give the deal to AM General and please Indiana state voters. Come September, he can still push GM to sell to Workhorse in Ohio to try and pick up votes there but by then i'll be on a boat in the Caribbean doing ketamine off midgets' painted feet so it's no skin of my perfectly smooth sack.

&amp;#x200B;

**$VCEL (BULL - mid-term)**

&amp;#x200B;

Vericel are a biopharm company specialising in therapies that aid tissue and organ repair. It's actually some pretty cool steam-punk tech that wouldn't be out of place in an Alien film or Demolition Man. Cell therapy to repair joints, biological skin graft and meshes to regrow organic tissue...it's cool. Most recently, this month they signed an exclusive deal with MediWound ($MDWD) to license and sell a burn gel (NexoBrid) in North America. The gel uses enzymes to remove burned tissue - in a phase II clinical trial, 93% of subjects experiencing complete removal of the damaged tissue. Great stuff. The deal with MediWound is performanced-based, so if the gel doesn't sell, VCEL won't be crippled by payments. Here's the really good bit: in Europe, you can't use this gel outside of specialist burn centres because it's too advanced for peasant use, but you yanks have a pretty lackadaisical approach to healthcare, which is why you're all hooked on pain pills and antidepressants. Anything that's restricted in Europe will sell like fucking cronuts state-side. Plus 75% of burn patients are treated at specialist centres in the US vs about a third in Europe. The icing on the cake is that VCEL dropped 8% after their Q1 earnings so i'm picking shares up at a discount. Will be seeing how things develop over the next few weeks / month either buying dips or closing if/when i'm up 15-20%. Bear in mind **FDA approval likely isn't until the end of 2020** \- if I had the patience I'd hold these guys for the long term but I know i'll just get bored. I'm looking to ride the recent positive sentiment up and then dump in a month or less.

&amp;#x200B;

**$VFF (BEAR - mid-term)**

&amp;#x200B;

Village Farms have had a good run recently. Nominally a fruit and veg grower, in 2017 they formed a joint venture with Emerald Health Therapeutics, called Pure Sunfarms, to grow cannabis, . Pure Sunfarms is profitable and all looks hunky dory for now BUT:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Village Farms are one of the most inefficient cannabis growers out there, with crop yields of less than 100 grams per square foot. Average is 100 grams or more, but compare this to Flowr Corp which use genetics to boost yields to about 300 grams per square foot. It means Village Farms are likely to have higher production costs and lower margins.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Pure Sunfarms have yet to secure buyers for most of their product. Couple this with general market oversupply of weed and you have a recipe for crushed prices and dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Village Farms stock price has jumped recently which means at best a correction and at worst a dump as investors realise there are much better growers out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

The way the cannabis industry is going at the moment, we should expect a contraction as the mom and pop and have-a-go growers get squeezed out by WEED CORP. I think Village Farms had a great idea to diversify into a profitable product using their existing infrastructure, but growing weed isn't like growing tomatoes. They either take it seriously and upgrade their farms and up their yield, or they fade away and go back to aubergines full time.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, I'm bearish in the short to mid term - hoping to close positions by the end of May, but may hang on a bit longer if weed prices take the downturn I'm expecting.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's discuss Telaria,"Hey gang, some hopefully helpful DD here on what I believe it a 3-4 bagger down the road.

The company is Telaria, a ""sell side"" digital advertising company that can produce, in-house, digital video content for multitudes of platforms. One of their largest contract is with Hulu, and they also have contracts with 5 out of the 7 largest digital advertising firms, or firms on the ""buy side"" of advertising. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BACKGROUND**  
In 2017, then-Tremor Video (now Telaria) was both in the buy and sell side of the business, but didn't really do both of them well. In late 2017, they decided to abandon the buy side, and focus solely on content generation for the sell side, and re-branded as Telaria. They do this through technoogy and service partners searching out premium video content.The name for their company, according to their website, is **""a derivation of the Greek word Talaria, which is the name of the winged sandals worn by Hermes, the messenger of the gods. We use this spelling because our core focus has always been video – from the smallest mobile screens to the largest televisions.""**  


**FUNDAMENTALS**  
Ticker Symbol: $TLRA   
Current Stock Price: $8.32  
Market Cap: $365 million  
52 week MA: 102.43%  
Glassdoor Review: 4.5/5 stars (100% approval of CEO)  


**IN THE WEEDS**  
Piecing some of this together from their recent quarterly report news coverage, but from 18Q1 to 19Q1, revenue increased 42% to 13.6 million. This is also an increase in 31% from Q4. Analysts were only expecting a 23% rise from Q4.  


What's driving the huge increases? Connected TV (or CTV). Year over year, Telaria saw a whopping 169% increase in revenue from connected TV advertising. At the beginning of 2019, Telaria locked in a contract with Hulu. CTV now accounts for 38% of the company's total revenue. 

  
Just as important is guidance. Management raised its guidance for the full year, guiding for revenue between $66 million and $70 million and adjusted EBITDA between $2 million and $5 million. Prior to raised guidance, management expected 2019 revenue between $63 million and $67 million and adjusted EBITDA between $1 million and $4 million.   


**BEHIND THE SCENES**  
Now, why is it important to differentiate between buy and sell side. The buy side of advertising is already riddled with many competitiors, and some are larger than others. However, the ""harder"" part (my emphasis) is on the sell side. The sell side is charged with putting together the content that not only does what the advertiser/client wants, but that is also acceptable to the platform (see: Hulu/Roku) in what they would  WANT its content consumers to take in. Furthermore, the sell side is less dominated by larger players in the digital video advertising space, so this gives Telaria a moat for the future.  


**THE FUTURE**  
Ummm, are any of us expecting a return to the ABC/NBC/CBS dominated world? Even 24-cable news is losing its luster for streaming ""connected"" TV. So, you want players who can do this job well and can have a notably ROI for advertisers. And with more and more streaming platforms either established or coming on line (Hulu, Disney+, Fire TV, Netflix, Tubi TV, etc...) the need for experts and winners in this field will grow. Telaria seems to be setting itself up for future success.

Additionally, for a company like this to abandon its previous business model, turn around, and accelerate like this in less than 24 months -- damn impressive.

In my opinion, easily a future $1 billion company.",TacAirlifter,1557599767,23,35,[],/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bnfd9i/lets_discuss_telaria/

LYFT
Okay, this is a bit risky because it already dropped 10% today. I expect this to keep dropping for the rest of the week. Autists who want to invest in ride hailing services will be wanting to buy UBER rather than LYFT, so they will probably hold out for UBER since IPO is so close. The best way to hedge bets for people, institutions who already got their hands on UBER stock is to short LYFT, because they can't sell their UBER  stock because of the lockdown period. The lower this goes the more UBER investors panic expecting similar behavior from UBER and short this.

$WKHS penny stock up 200+% today because of a Trump tweet,"The Tango Toddler strikes again.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/business/gm-lordstown-trump.html

From what I can see it’s a non-event. GM are selling a beat up plant to a shitty auto manufacturer. TT threw a piss fit when GM first closed the plant down, now they’re selling it, so he’s made it all about him and gave Workhorse a shout-out in the process. A bunch of hedge fund managers stopped blowing rails long enough to notice and pumped $47mil into the stock in a few hours.

Workhorse make delivery drones, a bunch of other retarded shit, and electric trucks. I’m told the W-15 does 0-60 in 5.5 seconds, but it looks like it’ll repel pussy at the speed of light so who cares. Plus Workhorse are in fucking Ohio. 

Finally, they borrowed $35 mil in January (I’m guessing to buy the plant?) but reported less than $400k in revenue in Q1.

This feels like a heartbreak waiting to happen. The auto industry in general is flailing about like a frog on fentanyl I don’t see how the price can be sustained at this level, I don’t care how many scalextric tractors they make.

Why I am buying $GLUU and you should too,"So as some of you probably have seen, GLUU has fallen over 15% (over $2) after its Earnings Report. I am here to say its Earnings report dip is bullshit.

GLUU destroyed their earnings report despite the original perception... **Year-Over-Year, their total assets are up 14%, their total bookings, up 7%, their Ad bookings up 32 freaking % and get this.... their Year-Over-Year Revenue... 18%...**

&amp;#x200B;

For me at least, GLUU is hitting all the right triggers and there were perceived poorly in their earnings report because they did not beat the high expectations they were given by a handful of analysts.

They have 3 more anticipated games coming out within the next 4 months that have all said to be positively reviewed in Beta testing as well as 2 more original IPs coming out next year. 

As the trends have shown over their past few ER's (good or bad) they take roughly 1-2 months before skyrocketing again. For example, their last ER on Feb. 5th... Between Feb. 5th and Apr. 5th, **their stock rose over** **28%**. ($2.51) 

Again, between Oct. 30th and Dec. 31st, **their stock rose over 18%** ($1.24) 

And AGAIN, between July 26th and Sept. 26th, it **shot up 27.5%** ($1.59) 

&amp;#x200B;

The proof is in the pudding folks and this pudding is 18% off right now... I want to buy both a few shares as well as some $12 calls probably expiring June within the next few trading days (after this tariff bullshit blows over and I sell my remaining calls/puts) unless there is something in the market that would heavily disrupt this industry.

# Are You New to Options?

If you don't even know the basics of trading options or what the Greeks mean (AKA you **shouldn't** be trading options yet), read this first:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/azjtai/psa\_important\_stuff\_you\_need\_to\_know\_before\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/azjtai/psa_important_stuff_you_need_to_know_before_you/)

# Some Thoughts For This Week

**Pretty exciting shit with the Trump tweets today right?** Just go ahead and fuck up the entirety of my DD I did, and force me to rethink it on the fly. These picks aren't coming from notes, but straight from my head as I type them out this week trying to give myself something to watch closely.

There's always the chance that the market dips and rebounds and we just resume on Monday. I honestly give it a coinflip chance of a MASSIVE down day followed by a slightly down day Tuesday, and a MASSIVE down opening, followed by ridiculous dip buying.

**On another note:** There's some people that run around here claiming I'm taking advantage of people (frontrunning, selling premium to you guys, etc, which is laughable since I don't list strikes and barely list the same stock two weeks in a row) or that I shouldn't post this DD because you guys will blindly go 'lose money' on it or whatever. **Let's get fucking real, you do that just fine on your own.**

Moreover -- the amount of you that have sent me messages about your gains/increasing success/increasing knowledge is encouraging, I do appreciate those PM's. I'm not here for the feels necessarily, but if you do something good for once, learn something, or have a real question to better your trading, feel free to private message me and let me know. Picked up something good? I enjoy knowing that you are making progress from being a complete degenerate to like, a half degen.

# How I Pick Plays For Myself

These plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions we are in (upturn, back/fill, pullback, sideways consolidation, etc). Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews and other metrics based on volume and volatility ratios. These are my own scripts, and nah, you can't have them. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low (for the most part) follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:

* Market cap of $5B+
* Daily volume of 1M+
* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.

# Results On Last Week's Picks

If you blindly bought in on Monday, most the picks were extremely profitable come Wednesday, I think all but one. However, JPow released his infinity gauntlet ([https://imgur.com/RY2XdtS](https://imgur.com/RY2XdtS)), and we all took the dick Wednesday and Thursday, I'm sure. Well, all of us except those that had cheap credit spreads to buy back and close.

Wednesday and Thursday can be discredited for almost all last week's daily price action because the entire broad market was down, regardless what you were playing. Friday was an awesome recovery and shows that we aren't just in a massive bubble, depending what happens Monday with Trump's fiasco today.

&amp;#x200B;

**Microsoft (MSFT) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $129.93, Closed: $128.89, High: $131.23

* ""Consolidation commencing"" - I ended up cashing out my calls mid week. I lost my heart to hold my $135s mid week on Wednesday, and cashed them out at super solid 175% or so. I've had them since like a week before earnings, so it was about time to move on. We saw a lot of back/fill action and consolidation until JPow unleashed the bears, however it had a pretty massive day on Friday. There were definitely points to get in on this mid week last week and if you bought the dip, you could have had a good week on it and might have a good one this week, even with the Trump shit coming to light tonight.

&amp;#x200B;

**Oracle (ORCL) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $55.29, Closed: $54.78, High: $55.50

* ""For me, Oracle is kind of a proxy play and a momentum play."" - And it still is. I think we're seeing a lot of consolidation here still and people are pretty likely to buy any impending dip on it with Monday's market. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Nvidia (NVDA) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $178.39, Closed: $183.00, High: $184.87

* ""BUYYYY THEEEE DIPPPPP."" - Not much to say here. It traded strong all week on the prior week's semi sector weakness and I think it did so appropriately. Earnings are coming up, so you may see quite a bit of people buying this stock up pre-earnings on the thesis that AMD beat earnings, so it's likely Nvidia will also (not to mention, EVERY COMPANY IS BEATING this earnings seasons because of the sandbagged guidance previously).

&amp;#x200B;

**Disney (DIS) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $142.19 (after hours rise), Closed: $134.28, High: $143.05 (pre-market monday)

* ""It's Mickey, mother fuckers."" - Yknow... this one pissed me off a bit. I had a chance to get out of my very profitable calls Monday after the initial dip, and did not do that. I sold Tuesday a bit after open and just decided to watch. That being said, we're back around where we were after the Disney+ announcement, and if it goes any lower, I'm very tempted to buy back into calls or even sell puts against earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Electronic Arts (EA) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $94.89, Closed: $92.50 High: $97.20

* ""Buy the dip?"" - So there's a lot to be said here. It's a perfect example of a good trader wins and a greedy one eats the dick. There was definitely a point on Monday AND Tuesday to enter, and a clear point on Wednesday to exit if your greed didn't get to you. You got another chance on Thursday morning, even. The way I look at this company has not changed whatsoever: They have been so heavily beat down for the last few quarters, and lost such a huge amount of their stock's value that the upside is much more likely than the downside. It's kind of like a game of limbo right now, but I'm not sure they can clear under another bar. We saw clear buying action off the $90ish lows before last week, and plenty of buying action even on Wednesday. The way I look at it is that most the bad news is priced into this stock, and none of the good news. Company valuation is improving, fundamentals in general, are improving, so they'd have to have a god awful earnings report to do any worse than they already are, and I just don't see that happening. They still hold some of the most popular sports franchises, which cannot be discredited, either. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Square (SQ) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $71.54, Closed: $68.52 High: $74.73

* ""I **LOVE** Square"" - And nothing has changed, either. As far as the trade, if you held through earnings, that's the risk we take, right? There was obvious places to profit here. Their payments processed number was disappointing in the quarterly report, but I think with this stock we're playing the long game. The earnings report made it all seem a lot worse than it was, and they bottomed out at $66 at one point last week. This is similar to what happened to $TEAM a few weeks ago, and Atlassian is almost back where they were pre-earnings. Same thing is likely happening here as far as a mean reversion goes. I think the company is strong, they fill an important and needed niche, but Dorsey needs to focus a lot more on expanded market penetration than his bullshit Cash App. Long term, the app has potential to get them into the peer to peer space a bit more, but I think his initial vision was probably as people using it like Apple Pay, and that, I just don't see happening. All of that being said, they don't have any real threat in the space (PayPal's card reader experiment was anything but successful) and they hold a special spot, doing a special thing for small and medium sized businesses (even some larger ones). They will likely focus on expanding service revenues, and I still am bullish on Square. It's a good spot to average down/buy in because in my opinion it's going back over $70 in short time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Alaska Air (ALK) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $60.30, Closed: $62.47, High: $63.26

* ""I always fly Alaska"" - And still will. The stock showed some great strength throughout all of the mid week bullshit, was mostly unaffected, and if you bought any time Monday, you're green and probably staying green, I went to almost all cash on Friday afternoon in my options account so -- this is one of the last ones I have, will likely liquidate Monday morning at some point, but may go back in if they clear/hold over $63. Not much else to analyze here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Exxon Mobil (XOM) -** ***BEARISH*** \- Opened week: $80.12, Closed: $77.47, Low: $77.24

* ""Exxon has shown some decided weakness"" - Now, the entire oil sector kind of pulled back a bit, but we're in a backing/filling period with it and I expect the sector to rebound sometime soon. It may not be this week but it's hard for me to stay bearish much below $75 or so in the short term. Played out as expected.

&amp;#x200B;

**Occidental (OXY) -** ***BEARISH*** \- Opened week: $60.00, Closed: $57.95, Low: $56.95

* ""Bidding war with Chevron now over Anadarko"" - The Buffett news helped them out a bit, and Icahn building a position is interesting also. That being said, I'm probably ready to be out of this. My main thesis was in general, they had introduced a level of uncertainty that was too much on the speculative news over the deal and that they would likely retract since the deal is anything but done, and they did. Now -- if they don't get the deal with Anadarko -- we could see it really pull back further, as stockholder sentiment will likely fall hard if they can't get a deal done with Buffett literally throwing cash at them. I'm also leaning bullish on the oil sector after last week, so it's hard to stay bearish here for consistencies sake.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spotify (SPOT) -** ***BEARISH*** \- Opened week: $144.40, Closed: $136.16, Low: $131.86

* ""The stock isn't cheap or competitively priced"" - Buying action reinforced that thought (or selling action, in this case). Even if you weren't in before earnings, there was a chance to get in on puts and make a good profit by Thursday's dip. That first candle on Monday morning should have been enough indication that it was going lower, too. 

# State of the Market

Bull and bear in a China shop right now - literally. It's just a lot to take in from a lot of angles. 

The dip off the Fed announcing they weren't doing anything was disappointing (obviously a cut was priced in at that point, solely based off price action, so no question about that now) but now we look for other catalysts to continue higher. The China trade deal is a big one but it seems that Trump is completely off his rocker and going full Elon on Twitter. The way I look at it is that a pullback is more imminent (could be one or two days, or could be a full week, or we can go full December, who knows) but the stabilization on Thursday and the buying action on Friday is a really good sign. It means that at least enough investors didn't really care about what the Fed said and decided at the prices equities are at, it was still worth buying things back up. If the market really disintegrates this week on Monday because of what Trump has said, I'm likely not trading a whole lot until the market shows its colors on Wednesday.

What I'm trying to get at is that you need to be fluid with your strategies. 

Some of the ones I had written down for this week like Google calls, Nvidia calls, selling put spreads on Amazon, selling put spreads on Apple, are all probably up in smoke over one tweet on a Sunday. My Alibaba catch up trade is also probably up in fucking smoke after what he said as I was about to buy FD calls on it.

I have them in my playbook still, but I may just hold onto them until an opportunity presents itself at some point whether it's this week or not. Now that earnings are behind us for a lot of companies, you can draw a thesis on a company based on their guidance and post earnings performance. Now is the time to be playing longer dated calls in single leg strategies, and now is the time to be formulating what shares you want to own in a wider portfolio because you know what sectors are poised to outperform, and what headwinds face other sectors. 

So we're shifting gears to include two sector based strategies this week, as an example of how to be fluid. Let's be clear... until the market shows some type of bottom or stabilization Monday(Tues/Wed)? on decent volume: I'm sitting out. You do what you want.

# The Picks for Week of May 6th, 2019

**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself.** Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.  I may or may not enter trades on these or may already be in them. The bottom of the post has the options I'm long on, as a secondary holding disclaimer.

Because I get shit for going with market trends, I'm going to try to pick things tat

&amp;#x200B;

**Nvidia (NVDA) - $183.01** ***- BULLISH***

They report on 5/16. So... after AMD's actually very solid earnings report, and them subsequently not holding their gains, I posted in the daily discussion that I was about to go balls deep in AMD calls. Well, I did. I bought a fuckton of cheap lottos at $28.50 strike and they all... expired worthless because I fell asleep mid morning Thursday and held too long. Too bad, so sad. That being said -- I think AMD's successful earnings report creates an opportunity to get bullish on Nvidia again.

I think Nvidia is in general, a better company than AMD, and AMD has to compete with both Intel and Nvidia, while Nvidia is only competing with one. Intel's shitty quarter may speak a lot to why AMD's was so good, but I think that overall, the huge uptick in Fortnite, Apex, etc. means graphic card sales probably closed some of the gap down from when the crypto bubble burst.

They are **VERY EXPOSED** to the China trade talks however. If the sector shows some real weakness, I plan to wait until it's done and find a GOOD ENTRY POINT HERE. I think the stock at some point is heading back north of $210, so it's all about being a magician with your entry point and being patient.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** June/July north of 200 calls, or if shorter dated, ATM once the market stabilizes this week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Amazon (AMZN) - $1,962.46** ***- BULLISH***

Because it's an easy pick and it's Amazon... right? BERKSHIRE DID IT WHY CAN'T I?! That being said... yeah there's a ton of momentum behind this move. Once again, the market is probably going to be shit on Monday morning, so there's a chance to play a catch up here after missing the move on Friday.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I saw a lot of cool gains on Friday morning on that pop -- but we likely are not getting a 3% day in this again overnight. I'm looking at slightly OTM calls, short expiration, mid May, trying to find a dip to buy on and wait for a rise on solid volume. I'm also going to try to replicate what some people did in the thread, and buy FD's on Thursday (because I cannot help myself) before close if the stock is down at all and Trump hasn't burned the entire market to the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

**Financials ETF (XLF) - $28.06** ***- BULLISH*** 

The banks have shown all kinds of strength in the last few months if you check the trend on this ETF. They've held above the $27 point which is really important, and I think we can see that continue for longer if the markets don't deteriorate into a complete pullback.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** May 17 calls, Jun 21 lottos. Likely playing the May's for the swing and not looking to take them too far into profit, and let the June's ride if the May's work out. If the May's do not work out, I will adjust my strikes for the Junes, average down if I can, and go back in on Junes, and watch/adjust as needed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Alaska Air (ALK) - $62.48 -** ***BULLISH***

Like I said in my recap, this stock showed immense strength through the rest of the market selling off. It's also on a good uptrend, has broken the $62 range which was really important point of resistance, and could be on it's way back to $70+. I like it still this week.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Only monthlies here, so front month ATM/1 strike inside, longer dated 3% OTM.

&amp;#x200B;

**Alibaba (BABA) - $195.21** ***- BEARISH***

This could be the pick that makes me look pretty fucking stupid, but I just cannot see how they can hold the last week or two worth of gains with how the trade talks are going. They're super exposed and some of these gains had to be the pricing in of a successful trade deal. Once the trade talk bullshit stabilizes (if it does) it's likely just going north again, so this has to be a short term play.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Front week ATM puts, monthlies somewhere between $190 and $185. Considering selling call spreads near the money on short term expirations, or even one or two strikes inside as the risk rewards pretty good if we can get a fat dip. I'll just eat max loss and pay to close them out if they don't work out rather than end up short shares.

&amp;#x200B;

**USA Oil ETF (USO) - $12.86** ***-*** ***BULLISH***

So the oil sector, as a WHOLE has shown a bit of strength over the last few months. While we're in the midst of a pullback, I think this is one to be watched. I may/probably won't trade it this week, but if we can see some positive action in the price of oil this week -- it's worth jumping on board. There's a decidedly obvious pullback at the EXACT moment in it all, but I think after a really good run this year without any hesitation, it was coming.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** FD's if they're still cheap Monday at $13, or $13.50 lottos at $2 a pop. June/July around the same strike, and $14's seem appealing even in June. Will be waiting on ALL these plays if the sector shows weakness Monday morning/afternoon, and pending any real news in the oil sector. If the pullback continues, just waiting and adjusting strikes appropriately until I feel comfortable entering and know I will average down if I'm wrong on timing it.

&amp;#x200B;

# What Strike(s) Are You Looking At?

I used to list these in detail, but I don't put as much detail into these now for multiple reasons. I've tried to slowly add more detail to help people see how I think about the trade in general, but YMMV. You should pick your own strikes, because I could very well be wrong. 

The majority of the time, if I'm playing anything near week or near month, it's going to be ATM or VERY slightly OTM. Sometimes I get the FD itch, like everybody else. I will regularly throw $100 or some shit at some SPY/QQQ lottos during strength or in volatile environments. In more stable environments, I'm less likely to do this. 

If I'm holding two or three months out I'm likely buying further OTM as I feel more comfortable accepting a 100% capital risk as the capital invested is normally lower and I'm much more speculative but have more upside. I'm also willing to average down on these positions heavily on down days. 

If I'm selling credit spreads or cash secured puts, it all depends. If I'm truly heavily bearish, I'm selling at the money shit and watching it depreciate quickly on a near week expiry. If I'm just sure it's in a consolidation period, I'm a bit OTM. If I'm really feeling like gambling, I might even sell ITM credit spreads on either side (calls if I'm bearish, puts if I'm bullish) and try to capture both Vega and intrinsic. 

If it's earnings, it all depends on my outlook on the company, it's current price levels/volume, and other economic/market factors, as well as sector influences. I can be very bullish short term but bearish past this month based on uncertainty, because uncertainty rules all.

# Can I Just Blindly Follow You And Win?

Nope, that's why it's called trading. In fact, you probably can't trade on the long side for more than 20% or so of your total plays and win in the long term (2-5 years). Six months, or one year, or whatever is not the type of trading volume to even form a real decision on a trend. Even a few thousand trades isn't really enough, and you may be working in a certain market environment where a strategy works, until it does not anymore.

I cannot teach you how to trade. Only how to pick things to trade. The trading is the hard part - we're not investing -- we're trading. Essentially it's high level gambling: Knowing when to hold 'em and knowing when to fold 'em is what this game is about.

**Just because a stock is listed here doesn't mean you blindly just enter a fucking trade on it.** Look for the entry, look for the catalysts, market news, sector strength/weakness, uncertainties, take advantage of sector moves up or other binary events, take advantage of pullbacks or consolidation to look for a price.

**The trend is your friend.**

Entries, exits, risk allowance on your portfolio, diversification of strategies, adjusting trades, legging in and out of positions, and many other tactics will decide your success. Starting with long calls or puts, or more desirably debit spreads (to limit capital exposure), are a good way to get a feel for how prices fluctuate. That will allow you to deduce more complicated strategies and decide what type of options trader you want to be. **There's multiple ways to profit off the same exact underlying,** at some points there will be longs AND shorts that profit at the end of the week.

**READ THIS:** The majority of people who win in the market are net sellers. That doesn't mean that there's never a situation where a single leg call or put is a good/okay idea. Somewhere between 50-90% of my activities with options at any given time is spent SELLING PREMIUM. I will **never** list a stock as Bullish that I have credit spreads open on or that I'm selling premium on. 

No more than 15% of my entire portfolio is in options at any time which is still incredibly high for the average person, but with the technological advantage and automation at my fingertips, I'm okay with having that level of risk. I also used to play poker semi-professionally, so I'm not risk averse, in any way shape or form.

Take this for what it is.

# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks

Correlated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them and the sector is likely doing well, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions.

# Should I Hold Or Sell?

Figure it out on your own. I can't tell you what's right for you nor do I care to. You have to learn to trade on your own, if this DD doesn't get you moving forward enough and you can't draw up a plan on how to trade it, then that's your problem and trading that stock or trading in general ***may not be for you.*** **To get better at this, play in markets you know well.** Play in stocks that move and behave somewhat rationally with sector news and are CURRENTLY in a correlated state (market goes up, stock goes up, and vice versa), and plan where you're entering and where you're exiting.

# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?

**Post coverage requests in this post. Not to my private messages.**

**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.

If you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment.

# Private Messages/Chat Requests

I may or may not respond. Depends if the question is worth answering or if you just glazed over the post. I won't answer private messages about specific stocks. **Post coverage requests in this post.** Strategy based things, more likely.

AMD Q1 2019 PREDICTIONS &amp; PLAYS,"**AMD Q1 2019 PREDICTIONS &amp; PLAYS**

People are starting to look beyond the numbers at AMD vs Intel, and they are starting to question anything that Intel has to say about their fabrication process improvements. Negatives for Intel include: CPU IPC has been largely stagnant for the past FOUR years. For those not familiar, IPC is Instructions Per Clock. It has nothing to do with the number of CPU cores, or the speed of a chip, and is entirely about how many instructions are executed per clock cycle. So a 2.0GHz chip with ah higher IPC will perform better than a 2.0GHz chip with a lower IPC. If the clock speeds increase, performance will go up, but newer chips with the same IPC won't be any faster when running at that 2.0GHz speed.

With Inte, 10nm being delayed itself would just mean that clock speeds won't go up, but a lack of any IPC improvements show that Intel is not improving the design of its chips well enough. So, what has Intel been doing over the past FOUR years where IPC hasn't improved? Intel finally improved the thermal interface material for better cooling of the chip itself(under the cover), so you see some speed increases, but there were already enthusiasts who were removing the lid from the chip to do this improvement themselves;, and the results has shown that the chips themselves have not really been improved, the news chips have better assembly.

So, AMD....When AMD first launched Ryzen in 2017, many people were surprised, if not shocked. Not only did AMD release 8 core chips(while Intel had stayed with 4 core chips) in the consumer space, but the new Zen core design was fairly competitive on an IPC basis as well. This allowed AMD to be every competitive with their new chips, and the only advantage that Intel had was a slight advantage in IPC, as well as high clock speeds. AMD offering double the number of cores did make Ryzen a very competitive product in most areas. Since that time, AMD boosted the IPC from first to second generation, as well as providing a bit better clock speed. Looking forward, the third generation Ryzen chips are expected in the next months (announcement and specs due on May 27th), with a 13-15% IPC improvement over second generation, and potentially a jump of 20% in clock speeds. Yes, this is a 20% boost on top of the 13-15% performance boost even at the previous speeds, so you can see how big of a jump this is expected to be, depending on clock speeds.

AMD isn't stagnant in IPC, isn't stagnant in clock speeds, and may even double the core counts to 16 cores in consumer grade chips. This is why things look very promising for AMD in the second half of 2019. Intel isn't expected to have 10nm desktop chips ready before 2021 at this point, so that is why those who understand the technology see so much potential for AMD right now. AMD has at the very least, a year where it will be well ahead of Intel. Q1 and Q2 are the periods before the new chips are released, and many are waiting to buy the new chips, so a slowdown in sales SHOULD be expected.

-expecting losses of 1B+ per year
-Profitability in 2024 with 60-90mil subscribers(“ambitious but achievable”-Fitch)
-Won’t keep undercutting Netflix prices for too long

ESPN
-Declining viewers and regular spats with Cable providers because it’s one the most expensive non premium channel(~$9)
-Rising costs of Sports broadcasts(MNF)
-ESPN+
   -Profitability in 2023(10mil+ subs)
   -Not sure of UFC contract but I’d imagine after    this deal is over they’ll demand more money
   -Not much content besides UFC so cant see it growing too well(more of a personal reason)

Hulu
-Comcast deal
   -17% of HULU content from NBCuniversal, reportedly Comcast might remove older content to their own streaming service but keep sharing new episodes on HULU but if they don’t that’s gonna hurt the catalog quite a bit
-Hulu loses 1.5B/year which Disney would also have to bag hold
-Profitability by 2024 but I’d imagine if 17% of their content is gone it’d slow user acquisition

Movies
-yes they acquired marvel and Lucas films and both have been money makers for them but the big MCU story arc and Skywalker saga end this year
 -kids movies are more hit or miss(yes frozen commands an audience and they can pump out 2-3 sequels but remember the first one came out 6 years ago I hope(for our futures sake) that a good chunk of the original viewers have grown out of it)

TV(ABC+Disney Channel)
-ABC decreasing viewers(cord cutters, streaming etc.)
-Disney channel- rising fee, decreasing penetration, and again streaming is killing cable(Disney+ will decrease subscribers)

Parks

BP $44.5 calls May 10th- Had a big drop with huge sell off, RSI is extremely low. It will run up into earnings this week. I’d recommend selling right before ER for this one. XOM had a bad ER, BP’s ER could reflect the same. 

GE $10 calls May 10th- High risk high reward play 50/50 chance. The expectations are already extremely low. If it can beat expectations there could be an 8% upwards move. Expectations shouldn't be hard to beat. Overall GE is a shit company and I wouldn’t hold this for long.

# How I Pick Plays For Myself

These plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:

* Market cap of $5B+
* Daily volume of 1M+
* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.

# My Project Update

A lot of you ask me if I have anywhere outside of here you can follow me on, etc. Follow me on my reddit profile, first of all, that's where you'll get anything in the future. Yeah I'm working on a blog and stuff but I'm a busy dude in real life and it's taken a back seat to my real clients and obligations. I'm still working on it. No, I won't share it here - mods have explicitly said no, so leave it there and **don't bother them about it.** That being said, I plan on making somewhere to share thoughts outside of this post, yes, it's coming, yes, but I'm busy as fuck with my business(es) and clients, meetings, etc.

# Some Thoughts About Last Week 

**What a week it was.** Mostly all the picks last week worked out in real time, same week which isn't always the case. Those of you that bought Twitter from a few weeks back on the longer dated option (which I always recommend) probably did pretttttty good with it. These picks don't necessarily always start this week, or end this week. These are the ideas that have crafted new trade theories based on what I believe to be true. Entering at the right time is an art, and I've spoken about this so many times but:

I cannot teach you how to trade. Only how to pick things to trade. The trading is the hard part - we're not investing -- we're trading. Essentially it's high level gambling: Knowing when to hold 'em and knowing when to fold 'em is what this game is about.

**Just because a stock is listed here doesn't mean you blindly just enter a fucking trade on it.** Look for the entry, look for the catalysts, take advantage of sector moves or other binary events, take advantage of pullbacks or consolidation to look for a price. Set stop limits and don't blow your load on weeklies because there's very few cases where they work well (Disney anybody).

**The trend is your friend.**

# About Playing Earnings Events

People ask how I normally trade earnings, are you selling? are you holding? what are you doing? etc. Here's my formula, it may or may not work for you but this is traditionally what I do.

Any earnings events I play, I'm normally in on the first sign of an uptrend/downtrend in the 2 week window prior to earnings OR I'm playing by letting earnings dictate the trend, and buying after the IV crush happens.

**THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND.**

Remember: The **ENTIRE** predicating factor in my plays is normally to catch higher periods of volatility at the right time, to profit not only on a move, but on the increase in Vega value of the option. Buying FD's the day before an earnings report is the opposite of this and while it SEEMS like it's your only way to make a 10-bagger happen, it couldn't be further from the truth.

Being in BEFORE the volatility allows me to simply liquidate a portion of the contracts for a profit, sometimes regardless of it even going slightly against the current price (average doooooown).

**I recommend finding a strategy that works for you and executing it.** If you buy 0-day or front month/front week FD's on earnings and lose, you should NOT be surprised. I'd say you likely are going to lose on 75%+ of those trades, moderately profit on about 90% of the remaining, and pop off on 10% of the remaining 25% (2.5% of the time). Unless you have killer DD or a reason to think the market is pricing in too low of a move, you **CANNOT BEAT THE PRICING MODEL.** For you to win, something has to be wrong, skewed, mis-priced, you must know something about the company that you think analysts/market makers are wrong on, or you have to be advantageously positioned greek wise so that regardless what happens, you win.

Research **price neutral strategies** (butterflies and calendar spreads, specifically, I hate condors but you can look those up too) if you want a way to be **SHORT VEGA** without investing as much capital. I could write fucking pages on strategies, but I won't, and you should learn some about them on your own and fuck them up a few times before you figure out the right places to play them.

**I bolded the words you need to research.** I'm not commenting anymore on strategy stuff here. Most people still won't listen to this anyway, but...

**A specific example:** I bought June MSFT $145 calls at $0.04 a piece, 40 of them, and then a chunk of $135's throughout the last couple days of the week before earnings. My scans showed that they were mis-priced and skewed, you couldn't have known this, but you can easily just by using intuition find these kinds of deals. They exist, trust me. Those $145 calls are now like $0.15 I think? But they were also $0.12 right before earnings, both because of the move up, but secondarily because of the Vega pump on the options. They barely moved in value after earnings, as the crush offset a lot of the price movement. I sold half (20) the day before earnings for 200%, and basically freerolled the rest. I sold a chunk between $0.14 and $0.16 after earnings, and still have 10 of them that I will iron fist until they go to 0 or make a grand or so. The trade is already profitable, I've locked that in, and I get to ride the lotto ticket on the house. I have two months to watch and decide if I really want to let them wipe themselves out or just take some more cash and move on.

**Buying price directional and holding, mathematically modeled, is a losing strategy when used by itself with no other factors taken into effect.** The smart traders will see this statement for what it means, others will see it to mean that you can't buy directional plays. The ones that see it the first way are learning how to trade, the ones that see it the other way are the gamblers.

# Results On Last Week's Picks

**Microsoft (MSFT) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $122.62, Closed: $129.89, High: $131.37

* Win. We know all about the good news and movement, I think it still has room to go but it's definitely going to find consolidation near 130 and chill for even another day or two longer than it has before it continues up. Pullback to 128-127 doesn't concern me and I'll just hold all my calls regardless. Looking at the movement of it, it's not completely out of the question to see one after earnings. I'd feel comfortable just bag holding my June calls until probably the middle of May, if it's still flat then, I feel like the cushion I've built is worth the risk for more upside here. I don't imagine it crashing down to 115 or anything, unless the entire market comes down with it.

**Verizon (VZ) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $58.14, Closed: $56.58, H: $58.49 (pointless, as it was pre-market)

* Yeah so they beat or whatever but it's a telecom company and their guidance was meh and the results were meh. I lost 60% on this trade, and just decided I'd rather not watch for it or navigate it anymore. Can't win them all.

**UnitedHealth (UNH) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $224.00, Closed: $237, H: $237.11

* ***I got really lucky here.*** The timing was just pure luck that it occurred the week I listed it but it popped off and rose pretty much all week. I think that it's probably going to continue the trend as long as there's volume behind it because of the reasons listed last week: The assets and forward looking potential revenue are not reflected in the stock's price. 

**Tesla (TSLA) -** ***BEARISH*** \- Opened week: $269.00, Closed: $235.14, L: $231.13

* **This one made me feel like a prophet.** Let's quote myself: ""It's always just a matter of time before they go back to $230 because of a car blowing up or somebody saying something stupid."" $230ish? Check. Tesla exploded? Check. Tesla said stupid things about leaf blowers? Check. Print print print.

**Facebook (FB) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $178.25, Closed: $191.49, H: $198.48

* Facebook had really stellar numbers in my opinion. Eventually, growth in USA has to stall and it did. The international numbers were fine, and the fact they're taking the front looking ""Let's fight the privacy battle together"" stance is great for sentiment and allows fund managers to freely continue piling into shares if they want to without their clients going SJW on them. I think the pullback is, well, whatever. People taking profit as they climb back near where they were last year, so wait for some high volume trading and an increase in price and this one still has room to make money. Sold half my calls for like 100%+ and the other half for a -2% loss because I held through the fall from grace for a day or two.

**Intel (INTC) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened week: $58.15, Closed: $52.43, H: $59.29

* Buy the dip in my opinion. Not gonna say much else here but the semis are under pressure -- but I think Intel is more isolated from the general semi companies solely because they'll always sell chips. Some of the old 1080ti cards that Nvidia sold are still running perfect and strong and the new gen offers an increase but not as incremental as people wanted. That being said, I think Nvidia is fine but they're a lot more prone to slowdowns than a company like Intel. I don't know when they'll stabilize, could be days or weeks, but when they do I'd look to profit on the move back up. China trade deal could be a big catalyst proxy play here.

# The Picks for Week of April 29th, 2019

**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself.** Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.  I may or may not enter trades on these or may already be in them. The bottom of the post has the options I'm long on, as a secondary holding disclaimer.

There was a witch hunt in the Daily Discussion thread claiming I retroactively edit my posts HAHA like I give a fuck or something... I called Twitter, I don't really care what anybody says. Feels good from my side, BRAH. I don't list every play I make, just the ones I feel like the community would be most interested in playing. I don't mention the premium I may be selling (but will list it if it's on any of the options listed) and I don't mention any other neutral strategies I'm holding if they're not in these stocks.

I typed less commentary about each stock because there's so many this week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Microsoft (MSFT) - $129.89 -** ***BULLISH*** \- Trend is your friend (anybody see a theme here?). Consolidation commencing, I plan on just holding my calls. Ride the wave. Numbers are good, Azure is growing, and if somehow before June that JEDI contract gets handed out and they get it, it goes up, hard and fast just the way I like it.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Holding my calls. Maybe adding more that are 10% or so OTM but knowing full well I may lose on them because it has to move, but if it does the payoff seems pretty immense and Mickey like.

&amp;#x200B;

**Oracle (ORCL) - $55.41 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* For me, Oracle is kind of a proxy play and a momentum play. 

There has been a pretty nice sized volume move on Oracle as of late and some of the bigger funds are adding to their holdings. The fact that Oracle is pretty cloud-driven, besides their enterprise on-site data storage (which is very much likely moving towards cloud based offerings) and that the data sector and cloud industry is booming ($TEAM anybody? Looks like it's climbing right back where it was after the ridiculous earnings selloff) I think it means they have a chance to start increasing market share. As a result, as more and more people buy into this theory, the price will rise as a forward looking idea and price it in. For me, the price is $56, if it can get over that and close there, the swing play is in full effect for me. It's right at new 52W highs and to me (trend, friend) and with any luck, the volume will hold up and we'll see it plow upwards further.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Specifically, some May monthly contracts at various strikes. Pick your poison, ROI comes with more risk, so the further out, the more risk. I'm pretty likely to just buy right ATM, and double down on some out of the money ones if it starts going for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nvidia (NVDA) - $178.09 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* BUYYYY THEEEE DIPPPPP. 

I am completely ignoring any 'market sector weakness' people are talking about in semis. It's cyclical, yes, and that's something to be cognizant of. I'm going to wait for the price to stabilize Monday and wait and see if any binary news pops its head out, orange man says something about China, etc. and make a decision if I want to enter or keep waiting. Ideally, it will go down even more, because Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. are going to be hugeeeeee benefactors to the trade deal news. **They report 5/16 and the fact the stock really hasn't moved much on a 2 month rolling basis, there seems to be upside on the idea of China, in and of itself.**

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Calls, various strikes, might even consider weeklies here because I'm playing it as a swing. I don't want to personally throw a few thousand at like 2020 calls and have to let them sit there to profit 100%. I'd rather just take a few shots at weeklies, or front month stuff, and see if I can catch a swing and just be appropriate each day or two and close out positions that are moving towards 20-50% losses, and take a few shots at it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disney (DIS) - $139.92 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* It's Mickey, mother fuckers. 

Saw Endgame, movie was pretty badass. They're going to enter a string of great movies, with Lion King also coming this year. Could they sell the news Monday? Sure, but idgaf. Mickey's my bro and I ride or die with him. If you don't know the updates here with Disney+ and what not, you're out of the loop and you should stop trading options. Nuff said imo. **They report next week, so it's important to pay attention to the fact that earnings and guidance COULD disappoint versus the share price at the time, and trigger a fat pullback. It's all risk/reward.**

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Throw a dart at a list of price strikes and buy them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Electronic Arts (EA) - $94.47 -** ***BULLISH*** \- We talked about this one a week ago? I think. Or two weeks. 

Either way, it started to find that bottom entry point. People keep asking if I'm concerned about Anthem. Those that are asking that I assume are gaming enthusiasts that watch a lot of clickbait YouTube videos and pay too much attention to what some random neckbeard think about the games that come out. The company made a killing on Apex (BUT THE BATTLE PASS!!!!! OMG, same shit, just shut up because people still bought it) and the number of people that I saw buying in game currency BEFORE the battle pass is immense. 

They could not have imagined that they got to the player base they did so fast and more importantly the stock did not drop because of ANY of these reasons. It dropped because of the Origin security flaw. Flaw's fixed. Price hasn't gone back up. Not priced in. **They report NEXT WEEK so if I'm going to up my position it will be this week, not next.**

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** June or even later calls. I'm spread from strikes currently 115-125. I might even go deeper in the chain and bet on insane action in the next month. Depends how spicy I feel and whether Taco Tuesday is any good this week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Square (SQ) - $71.55 -** ***BULLISH*** \- **They report Wednesday after market.** A lot of people have heard me talk about this company. I **LOVE** Square. They have good tech and a good platform. I know that they're expanding their service offerings and improving on the software they acquired from Freshbooks. 

Their appointments app is their bread and butter besides the payments fees, and the hardware sales help to push profits higher also. They just got me for like $600? I think or more even for a new iPad/stand setup. It just works well. This segways me to mention that if and when Stripe comes into the market as far as IPOs, be careful about being in Square or PayPal. Stripe is going to fucking crush it, they are the holy grail fintech company in my opinion.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Kind of sketch to get in now if you aren't, so I may just sell premium on these and then buy upside calls with the profits after earnings, but I'm not 100% yet. I'll probably YOLO in on weeklies or something just because I can't help myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Alaska Air (ALK) - $60.62 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* They just ate some price target cuts after earnings but I feel like analysts are pricing in the idea of a wide market pullback and the impacts of Boeing on the company. That being said I really like Alaska as a company and when I do fly, it's normally Alaska anywhere I go. Their price target cuts are still 15% or so above where the stock sits, and if the entire sector gets any type of positive news, they'll pop up along with Delta ($DAL) and Southwest ($LUV).

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** June or July's, trying to pick the strike that I feel they can reach, not surpass, and then selling a large portion of my position if they approach the price closely. In my opinion and modeling, $70.52 is the price my algorithm spit out at me. I won't say what goes into it, and I won't say what variables I set as the projection so don't ask, **and it means ABSOLUTELY nothing** but I just hate going against my computer because it turns into a snarky bitch when it's right and I'm wrong. Either way, seems like the options aren't that pricy, although the spreads are kind of fucked on these. If you don't get a good fill on a dip at open when the bid spread crashes and rips the ask price down with it, then you probably won't find an advantageous position here. It's more lotto ticket than buying FD's on Square, honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Exxon Mobil (XOM) - $80.49 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* While the rest of the oil sector is buying itself up and combining companies into conglomerates even further, Exxon has shown some decided weakness and off their last earnings report, I'd be willing to say we see a dip here that I'm willing to jump on the train for. 

It all depends on risk tolerance though because I'm kind of betting against a hot market with where oil prices are at and it's completely possible the market 100% ignores everything that is out there on the company and is completely irrational and the price just goes up. Sure, crude pulled back but it's still way above where it was in recent months, so to me, that would signal that guidance for these companies could be getting sandbagged for the next round of earnings, so keep this in mind because they probably aren't re-working guidance based on oil pricing fluctuations but rather a range and probability model of the prices in certain economic conditions in similar years.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Another spot where I'm willing to sling a bit at a 3-5% move on weeklies for puts because they're really not that expensive and people/algos will freak out over the Trump ceiling on the oil market. I'm personally considering following up the weeklies with some that are longer expiration, at a deeper strike, and rolling my weeklies along the way until I decide I've lost/made enough on the trade. Oil markets kind of a bitch sometimes and I have a slight vendetta against it for life.

&amp;#x200B;

**Occidental (OXY) - $61.31 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* I'm going against the grain with this company because they continually are in the news and have allowed themselves to enter a bidding war with Chevron now over Anadarko. 

Chevron will likely win this battle for the reason that I have a inkling that there's some options written into the deal for executives which would explain why they may take a lower priced offer for the company. If this happens, it will make Occidental appear snubbed and like a bitch, and thus, the price will go down because shareholders will lose faith in the ability of the board to get a deal done. Moreover, they've raised their bid and showed they're willing to pay more, so Chevron could bid this way the fuck up and if the bidding war doesn't stop -- shareholders traditionally don't like a company paying way more for something just because someone bullied them into it.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** This is another play I like shorter term holdings on. I'll probably buy puts and hold for a day or two, and roll some profits if they win or pick a different entry. I'd like to see lower volume on the day or timeframe I decide to enter, it would show me people aren't really trading it and stockholders or algo's could sell it off in anticipation of the entire situation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spotify (SPOT) - $138.25 -** ***BEARISH*** \- **They report tomorrow before market.** 

Don't take my bearish stance on Spotify to mean that I think the company is poorly run or a bad company. I think Spotify is a GREAT company but I've spoken to three girls this week that exclusively use Apple Music now because it's 'convenient'. Their family plan also seems to have impacted their ability to get individuals to buy accounts because I'm sharing one with three friends, none of which live under the roof with me. Combined with the fact that Apple Music is indeed growing just as fast as they say it is, and taking market share, I think it's only a matter of time before Spotify tops out on growth. The stock isn't cheap or competitively priced anything so there has to be really positive news and guidance to go up.

* **Plays I'm Looking At -** So it's too late to get any options for earnings on this BUT, I can easily play a swing on the report and draw a thesis, even if I'm wrong. It's possible that at open, there's still a play to be made but I'm definitely waiting for the IV to settle down.

# State of the Market

We're going to get to those all time highs sooner or later. I hope it's sooner because a lot of plays I have are kind of betting on the short term being to the upside above those highs. I think that there's piles of opportunities right now, and I think we're going to see volatility greatly increase this week and next as May approaches. There's little question that the sideways action represents some type of wide-spreading accumulation and consolidation, so the question is will the people accumulating for the next move upwards on the S&amp;P be stronger than those taking profit? If so, we make all time highs and continue cruising. If not? See you in a few weeks 2,700.

# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks

Correlated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.

# Should I Hold Or Sell?

Figure it out on your own. I can't tell you what's right for you nor do I care to. You have to learn to trade on your own, if this DD doesn't get you moving forward enough and you can't draw up a plan on how to trade it, then that's your problem and trading that stock or trading in general ***may not be for you.*** **To get better at this, play in markets you know well. Don't try to find the next Disney, play in stocks that move and behave somewhat rationally, and plan where you're entering and where you're exiting.**

# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?

**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.

If you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment.

# Private Messages/Chat Requests

I may or may not respond. Depends if the question is stupid or not.

# Holdings Disclaimer

On listed plays: I am already hold various combinations of positions on Oracle (long/neutral), Microsoft (long), EA (long) and Disney (long).

Long $AMC (DD inside),"All I've heard about this weekend is Avengers: Endgame. I don't watch myself because I'm not a nerd, but I'm aware the film blew high expectations out of the water and has already set records for highest grossing box office of all time, best in the 108 year history of cinema. Expecting AMC to go on a tear and now is a ripe time to get in. DD below (mostly just free flowing thoughts, sorry):

&amp;#x200B;

AMC has the most theaters in the US and in the world; they adjusted hours to 24/7 this weekend and set aside 10M seats this weekend alone, with 58,000 screenings. The film just set records in all 15 countries where AMC has theaters.  Everyone has been so hard far Disney lately, and I am not disputing Avengers to be a huge success for Disney. But Disney has SO many companies and revenue streams: FOX and other TV networks, property/parks, music studio, Hulu, etc etc, but take a look at AMC's income statement....revenue is just 1) admissions and 2) concessions, the latter of which is obviously dependent on the former. AMC will directly benefit its top line from every single ticket sale, period. (Link to all of Disney companies:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/9149yi/companies\_disney\_owns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/9149yi/companies_disney_owns/)  )

&amp;#x200B;

AMC's CEO said last week this is just the start of what he thinks will be ""the biggest 9-month span in the history of cinema"". And he would not be surprised if Lion King beat out Avengers later this year. I could not agree more that the movie slate is impessive. Here are some upcoming films with confirmed 2019 release dates: Detective Pikachu, Lion King,  Joker, Frozen 2, Toy Story 4, Secret Life of Pets 2, Hobbs and Shaw, Jumanji 2, MIB, another Star Wars, Aladdin, Shaft, IT, Rambo, Terminator, Zombieland 2, the Tarantino film with Leo/Brad (i forget name), John Wick, and I am probably missing some other decent films. And that is just by end of 2019! (Link to AMC CEO interview:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amc-ceo-adam-aron-talks-210404501.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amc-ceo-adam-aron-talks-210404501.html) ) 

&amp;#x200B;

If you think Netflix/Hulu/Disney/piracy are hurting theater foot traffic, think again. Movie theater attendance in 2018 was a record year despite underwhelming film releases, and annual attendance sets a record every year or two (this was a big surprise to me). I know that I will be seeing Lion King, Toy Story, Detective Pikachu, the Tarantino film myself, and I haven't been to the movies since Blade Runner 2049 came out a couple years ago, and another 2 year gap before that. You can be certain that when people see films like Avengers (3 hours 2 mins long), they will be spending a lot at concessions as well, which is &gt;30% of their revenue and the biggest margin contributor. (Link to 4/17 investor day deck:  [http://investor.amctheatres.com/Cache/1500119352.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1500119352&amp;iid=4171292](http://investor.amctheatres.com/Cache/1500119352.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1500119352&amp;iid=4171292) )

&amp;#x200B;

AMC has had some impressive growth in its subscription service ""A-List"", confirming 750,000 members per recent announcement (I think last week). Those numbers obviously don't mean anything without context, but it was far greater than they expected since it was launched about 18 months ago. And I'm guessing as people are going into the theater to view Avengers and other big hits this summer, they're going to increase their A-List members just by finding out it exists. It's also a matter of time before MoviePass collapses, similar to ""Sinema"" did last week (basically a MoviePass ripoff). I just checked the Apple app store....AMC A-List is now the #5 free app in entertainment (Fandango is #4, likely because so many people downloading it lately), and #33 overall for free apps in the store. I can't remember where it was at when I checked last month but it was definitely lower.

&amp;#x200B;

The financials need improvement, and the balance sheet is ugly at 3.72 Long Term Dt/Eq. PE is below industry but overall fundamentals are not great. But that is why there is 17.15% short interest on AMC, and it should not be underestimated how powerful the squeeze impact could be once it becomes clear that 2019 could very well be a record year for theaters. There's also not a ton of analyst coverage or institutional ownership, which is good.

&amp;#x200B;

I hold shares long and am not interested in options on AMC. I know that's blasphemy around here but I do believe r/investing is full of morons. While I do think Q1'19 earnings (announcing 5/9) might underwhelm due to disappointing movies in theaters right now (what's been the best film of year...Dumbo??? ffs), I'm expecting huge guidance revision/upgrade soon, and expect this to rise above $20/share in 2019, very likely sooner rather than later. The company is lagging the market since the December turnaround; with all the buzz around Avengers, I think it will open quite a bit higher on Monday and then continue to run up to earnings. I think even a 1-week play to earnings could be a very nice yield thanks to the Avengers buzz and strong earnings season thus far (that will likely continue this week with Google and Apple), and I think that medium term play is a very, very good one. This thing will get squeezed up eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: people still go to the movies (2018 was somehow a record year despite weak films), and a whopping 2019 movie slate is about to follow the record setting Avengers film. AMC has the most theaters in the US and across the globe compared to any other company. There's 17% short float on this pig, and it's going to get squeezed up above $20/share at some point this year.

"Technical Analysis and Stock Picks [April 25, 2019]","I didn't expect this but I feel like I learned a lot from writing up everything (not everything). Also, I'm not exactly sure how I want to format these yet or how often I'm going to update them, but I'll figure it out eventually.

I actually meant to post this last night, but I wasn't finished so I got up an wrote the rest this morning.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm definitely going to need to put this disclaimer for the rest of eternity so that I don't get murdered by angry internet gamblers.

&amp;#x200B;

""**Don't do anything based on what I say. I'm serious. Please Don't.**

This  only exists because I can't find a decent trading journal. Especially  one that would remind me to check whether or not I was right. I plan on  developing the application (unless one of you guys want to do it, Not  like I give a fuck.) after I finish up my finals and stuff. This is a  pretty decent replacement in the meantime.""

&amp;#x200B;

Also here's something interesting I've known about for a while but i think writing it out can put it in perspective. If you can hold an option longer (without being a dumbass bag-holder) you stand to make significantly more than you do if you buy FDs all fucking day. Crazy advice for gamblers but hey, chase the win or some bullshit like that.

Basically, you can buy some options that have a further expiration- if you can manage to get them for cheap on whatever trend you've decided on, and over time you can reap those sweet %s that you morons jump for intraday.

I've watched options move hundreds of percentages over a longer trend- even if it's wrong sometimes. But it doesn't do that for FDs.

&amp;#x200B;

There's also advice that I'd taken from several books, which is to not jump on to a moving train. For a proper trade, you want to be ready before the stock explodes- and sure, you can't predict that, but that's not your job. Your job is to figure out what the market is telling you, and reacting appropriately. Or maybe your job is to blow all of your wife's vacation money. I don't judge.

Okay, I'm done being a wet blanket.

# Let's recap:

So firstly, today was an absolute clusterfuck. Tesla (TSLA) missed eps by 336% and is so far not reacting. Boeing (BA) weeklies moved 100% twice during and then down following their investors call. And Facebook (FB) broke out like a motherfucker AH. And Amazon dropped down all day, and then mostly recovered AH.

&amp;#x200B;

*Okay, another thing. I'm sure I don't have to explain that I'm not necessarily predicting the next day's behaviour rather the trend of the market for a particular amount of time.*

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so I'll go through some of yesterdays callouts.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**

So this is kind of what I expected.

&gt;The lack of consolidation and the fact that the RSI has crossed into  overbought (keep in mind, stocks and ETFs are capable of continuing  above 70% for a while- but we usually see a pullback. So its possible to  expect that tomorrow.

I also said:

&gt;This isn't any particular pattern as far as I am aware, but I've  definitely seen this happen a few times with stocks before and it acts  as an ascending wedge. **It could fall back.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vs2kr0t70fu21.png

And as a result, we saw the RSI begin to comeback down and may continue til its made distance from the overbought territory. Whether this is a pullback or a reversal, I can't say. But at least as of right now, I'm doubtful this is a reversal.

&amp;#x200B;

The same applies to **Amazon** but also for a completely different reason:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/9r0tyk290fu21.png

&amp;#x200B;

Though Amazon didn't react this way correlative to SPY, it has been known to be influenced on the downside of its movements.

The reason is because they fully withdrew from china.

That said, I could still see AMZN going up to 2000.

But tbh its pretty easy to trade Amazon. If it picks a direction. Boom go in that direction. Easy money.

&amp;#x200B;

**Apple (AAPL)** also did the same thing, but this time it was correlative.

https://i.redd.it/tzti2uca0fu21.png

&amp;#x200B;

It was hella reactive, but correlative. I'm still sure that the stock will try to climb back, but that also depends on whether the market will maintain the ATH trading range.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, on to the new stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**CATERPILLAR (CAT):**

So this bastard is sporting either an ascending wedge or a triangle (probably a triangle).

They're down yesterday because of their earnings, though they beat EPS: ( 2.94 vs 2.84 exp).

You can probably ride this stock up a bit longer, before you get an actually good upward jump, if it does end up being a wedge (which it might be based on the highs)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/v0cpt15c0fu21.png

&amp;#x200B;

**Facebook (FB):**

So yesterday in the afterhours as most of you know, Facebook shot up about 15 dollars. And it's actually filling a gap that it had made back last July. I'm pretty sure most of it has been covered in the afterhours, but gapping can sometimes take away any legs it has. The grey area is the gap.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ta7mz88d0fu21.png

Fundamentally there's alot about facebook that  we can talk about but I dont wanna. Moving on

&amp;#x200B;

**AMD**:

I'm pissed about AMD because I had it front of my face all day yesterday and instead I trading Boeing. Anyway, it's now trading around $28.46. There's a bit of resistance around here thats being kinda rejected on the hourly. Youll probably find a good move here if you can get a larger volume pick up.

But, I think this may be forming a cup and handle.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/y2soudce0fu21.png

It hasnt really gotten to the handle part so who knows, but if it holds this area at all I could see it wedging down and then breaking out.

If it breaks 30 with solid volume, then you may have a good long play.

&amp;#x200B;

**ROKU: Sideways (?)**

Kinda the same thing. Its got a cup and handle-ish thing going on- but thats more on the hourly chart. On the weekly and daily you have a wedge thing going on. Either way, it'll probably shoot up at one point soon. Or not.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/6nuv2fbg0fu21.png

# Final Notes:

I haven't elaborated on any of the technical indicators because there's no point unless there's price action to confirm it. Remember that indicators are lagging, so by the time you find out, it may have already happened- that type of bullshit. Also volume. Volume is important. You're gonna be making shitty breakouts if the volume is below average, so watch that as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really getting to much into the volatility of the options or the stock right now because I'm just calling plays based on set up and writing this shit down takes forever. Writing the fundamentals and all that other shit will take a lot longer.

Ill get that shit figured out, though.",idkhow2doanything,1556200167,8,8,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bh8uqg/technical_analysis_and_stock_picks_april_25_2019/

"""Respectable"" Hedge Fund Tied To Ponzi Scheme and Kushner Family (Proof, censored at r/investing)","**I am literally the only person in the world trying to tell this story right now.**  Over 30 major media outlets have declined to carry the story.  The facts I'm asking people to look at are irrefutable, I only ask for the right to speak.  That right has been denied repeatedly on popular Reddit subs.  I hope WSB will be different.  Please show that you're better than the rest.

Connecting this $1 billion hedge fund (Crawford Lake Capital Manahement) to the Wextrust Ponzi takes only a few clicks on the SEC website.  Most people don't know how to navigate the SEC's archives, so I made a short video showing exactly how to find it and posted it on Youtube.   I'm not trying to become a Youtube star, just trying to demonstrate the steps to find a specific document people need to see to prove what I'm saying is not a conspiracy theory.  I've uploaded it directly to you.   I hope you'll let it see the light of day.

Earlier today, I tried posting the youtube link at r/investing.  A moderator named **MasterCookSwag** from r/investing (who I see frequently trolls this sub)  banned me there, and muted me from calling him out on it.

PCG DD Binary CoC Decision,"Disclaimer: I am short PCG, opinions are my own and should not be taken as financial advice. I am not responsible for any plays you may make.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR at the bottom

In the past, I wrote up about PCGs issues here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7ilycb/proper\_options\_dd\_pcg\_jan\_19\_2018\_50\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7ilycb/proper_options_dd_pcg_jan_19_2018_50_put/)

&amp;#x200B;

Some background since then.

PCG saw wild swings which eventually resulted in a hostile takeover when the stock plummeted near 8$.

PCG has been over taken by hedge fund managers, they recently replaced their entire board with members from BM (Blue Mountain) [http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13370545&amp;RcvdDate=4/23/2019&amp;CoName=PG%26E%20CORP&amp;FormType=8-K&amp;View=html](http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13370545&amp;RcvdDate=4/23/2019&amp;CoName=PG%26E%20CORP&amp;FormType=8-K&amp;View=html)

against the request of regulators and the California Governor [https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/03/28/pge-board/](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/03/28/pge-board/)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now the binary event:

New management knows they need to avoid reducing shareholder value, and thus have requested a 60% increase(10%-&gt;16%) in their CoC (Cost of Capital) effectively trying to pass along the cost of their mistakes to customers.

&amp;#x200B;

The California legislature has been vocally apposed to this, even introducing a bill prohibiting the rate increase without the legislatures approval. [https://sd13.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-02-22-senator-hill-introduces-legislation-protect-pge-ratepayers](https://sd13.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-02-22-senator-hill-introduces-legislation-protect-pge-ratepayers)

&amp;#x200B;

The bills progress: [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill\_id=201920200SB549](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB549)

&amp;#x200B;

Their new request would put them at 16% CoC, but historically no public utility company in California has been approved above 11.5.  Peers in the group are currently at a 10.5 rate.  PCG is trying to shift the blame to climate change in their request.

""To help attract the necessary capital to meet its customers’ energy needs, PG&amp;E requests

a 16 percent rate of return on equity for 2020, which would result in a $1.2 billion increase in its

revenue requirement. ""

&amp;#x200B;

One of two things may happen in this binary event, pushing the stock drastically in either direction.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The CPUC (California Publich Utilities Commission) approves the increase, PCG stock soars and is able to pass cost onto customers, price target \~40$

&amp;#x200B;

2. The CPUC rejects the increase leaving PCG with massive forward looking debt (28B in improvements stated by PCG itself + cost of fire claims), PCG will have to raise capital through additional debt or by share delusion. Additionally, they may just start selling assets and bleeding out the company (see Sears) price target \~10$

&amp;#x200B;

The decision is being tracked here [https://apps.cpuc.ca.gov/apex/f?p=401:56:0::NO:RP,57,RIR:P5\_PROCEEDING\_SELECT:A1904015](https://apps.cpuc.ca.gov/apex/f?p=401:56:0::NO:RP,57,RIR:P5_PROCEEDING_SELECT:A1904015)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

Approval/Rejection of PCG 60% Cost of Capital request will swing the stock wildly in either direction depending on the California Public Utilities Commission decision.

"Technical Analysis and Stock Picks [April 23, 2019]","First, I'd like to say this is not an attempt to copy u/SoRefreshing.  They know infinitely more than I do, and  has way more experience. I can totally be wrong about virtually everything, so if anything inverse everything I say. Actually don't do that, in case I'm accidentally correct. Believe me, my username checks out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also like to state that entries and exists are everything. ""2 elite traders can go $LONG and $SHORT on the same stock and still make profits"" - paraphrased Alexander Elder. 

&amp;#x200B;

\##Don't do anything based on what I say. I'm serious. Please Don't. 

This only exists because I can't find a decent trading journal. Especially one that would remind me to check whether or not I was right. I plan on developing the application (unless one of you guys want to do it, Not like I give a fuck.) after I finish up my finals and stuff. This is a pretty decent replacement in the meantime. 

Okay So let's do this. 

\##Current State of Markets 

To be honest, there are only a few things that i think \_really\_ matters right now. 

So, firstly, the S&amp;P 500 has reached it all time highest  of $2,933.68. Same goes for the NASDAQ Index.  

The US is currently attempting to stop all countries from purchasing oil from Iran- with China being the only one that's still doing so. The deal was set a while back and countries had been given an amount of time to determine an alternative. 

We are currently in Earnings Season's and the defense sector has won out quite a bit. The health sector is being influenced by our hopeful socialist candidate. $UNH was a fantastic play these last few days. 

This is not important, but it proves you guys suck: $SNAP beat ER. So yeah. 

&amp;#x200B;

\##Technical Analysis and Stock Picks

\*\*$SPY- (Bullish Uptrend)\*\*

So obviously it's returning back to it's previous highs and intends on holding above it. The volume didn't break even the average, so I not very confident in it. It hasn't consolidated yet, so there is a potential for tomorrow to be a red day (not 100% on this). Since $SPY is riding the 6 and 12 day EMAs, it's pretty solid trend. The lack of consolidation and the fact that the RSI has crossed into overbought (keep in mind, stocks and ETFs are capable of continuing above 70% for a while- but we usually see a pullback. So its possible to expect that tomorrow. 

https://i.redd.it/5x2bp0iks4u21.png

This isn't any particular pattern as far as I am aware, but I've definitely seen this happen a few times with stocks before and it acts as an ascending wedge. \*It could fall back.\*

https://i.redd.it/sxvdnm0as4u21.png

\*\*$AAPL- (Bullish)\*\*

I called the bull run on Apple around March 20th and i still see it happening.

Apple has ER in about a week, and a shit ton of ground to cover. Many stocks have to recover back before the Q4 bear run. Including $AMZN and this boi. This stock definitely feels like it can potentially rise back to around $230, If the ER is solid it'll probably be the catalyst that we need push up past the $210 resistance. 

https://i.redd.it/suesyhqjv4u21.png

The cross on the RSI, isn't necessarily the cause for concern, but we should anticipate that we'll lose some momentum which is why you don't \*BUY FDs ON SWINGS.\* 

 I swung this for a few days and made a decent percentage with minimal downside. It works (mostly). I'll probably get in and out through the rest of the week. 

\*UNH- Bullish\* 

This stock is a paint point for me because I was in a Puts play in it when it was about $1.50. I pussied out and watched this bastard climb it's way to $11.00. But its a good play. It's recovering from a major market over reaction to the ER and the Bernie Sanders Medicare-for-all. 

I really like the options on this stock and they are powerful on solid moves. 

https://i.redd.it/zhplvkalx4u21.png



 The DMI+ is pushing upward while the - is downward with a stronger ADX. With the MACD is also recovering. And the Weekly bottom candle is (kind of) a Doji. With this week being a confirmation- thus far. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/tz5gsf1205u21.png

I'd wait for it to break 232. It may try to fill a gap up to 234, which isnt that big, but gives it an official bull trend which is a good thing for calls as it'll break the 12 day EMA.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Amazon (AMZN)- Bullish \*\* 

I definitely think I could confidently $LONG this stock up to 2000. It's just how $AMZN moves sometimes. May see some resistance around 1967. And probably 1950 since that's just how it does things. 

Not going to bother with a chart here. 

I am concerned though, because I've been seeing a bearish divergence so It may reverese sometime soon, pretty strongly. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Boeing (BA) -sidways until it crosses 384\*\* 

Their ER is tomorrow morning. So basically I anticipate that they won't be down on revenue because the MAX 8 weren't discontinued till the end of the quarter. HOWEVER, we will definitely see them lowering their guidance for obvious reasons.

So the open gap from a bit ago has some room to fill. We have a support level at $363. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/v5ayc3y125u21.png

If the ER has a bullish sentiment behind it- then you can anticipate a large move. Probably to 378 or 380, depending on the open.  

Volume Drop-off is because of ER so expect some interesting volatility tomorrow. (I can't really speak to how much, yet) 

&amp;#x200B;

\##I'm tired as fuck and have other shit to do now, so I'll just post the rest of my notes and update this later. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*ROKU\*\* 

 on the weekly is a double top, reaching its bottom, as well as on the daily a major break through a major support . 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*JNJ\*\*

Good guidance in ER but a strong 140 resistance. (this note is from quite a bit ago.) 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*QCOM\*\*

 (also from about a week ago after the lawsuit ended) 

Insane Move, Outlook on this should be put side

(STRONG) 76.5 Level, Most recent Highest High, High Vol Break Down for Trade

(IDK) 81.23 Level, Got it in the last 5 Years, Was previous High at that Time, Pre-market seems to hit that Level

(IDK) 78.38 Level, Bottom of that range from this level to 81.23, could act as ""support""

&amp;#x200B;

\##Final Notes: 

I did notice that most if not all of my plays are $LONG. This is either because I'm wrong, or the market it bullish, idiot. But seriously, some of these have intraday shorts that you'll want be on the look out for if you scalp at all. Otherwise, wait for confirmation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of these plays can be weighted by the whole market or sector depending on how everything goes. If you see $SPY jump up $10 or some bullshit like that, expect the same for most of the tech stocks. We're at a very interesting point in the market in my opinion and at this point it's anyone's game. We could continue to rally or all of the newbies entering the market will get mega-fucked and time will tell.

Insulet (PODD) Due Diligence:,"**Insulet (Nasdaq: PODD)**

**Industry:**

The Health Care Equipment &amp; Supplies industry has two main lines of business. One sub-industry supplies health care equipment to hospitals and patients in outpatient care. The other sub-industry focuses on the creation of new and more technologically advanced medical equipment to improve the efficiency and accuracy of patient care.

The industry remained relatively strong throughout the past bear markets and slowly improving economy. As the improvements in the economic backdrop propelled exciting growth in many industries, the Health Care Equipment &amp; Supplies industry’s performance has been comparatively lackluster. However, the industry environment has remained largely positive. There are a couple of main growth factors that have driven this industry to perform well. The first and most influential demographic factor for this industry is the increasing age of the population. The total elderly population has grown significantly, while “baby boomers” have shifted into their 60s and 70s.

Not only is the average life span increasing, but people are also remaining much more active later in life than in the past. This has expanded demand for many products supplied by this industry ranging from medical devices for serious conditions that, more often than not, affect the older population (such as pacemakers and stents) to devices and surgeries that help improve the quality of life (such as joint replacements and laser eye surgery).

Another factor is the growing demand by patients and doctors alike for improved technology and better health care equipment. This has caused health care equipment suppliers to increase their research and development expenditures to try to discover more efficient and effective products. One concern for this industry is the potential for federal budget cutbacks that would negatively affect those companies receiving some form of federal funding.

The future of the industry has a positive outlook, due to the continually aging population. The key factors mentioned above not only indicate the increase in the industry’s clientele, but also show that the Health Care Equipment &amp; Supplies industry is actively working towards helping health care facilities improve their ability to treat this clientele more accurately and efficiently.

**Insulet:**

Insulet is primarily engaged in the development, manufacturing and sale of its proprietary Omnipod® Insulin Management System (the OmniPod System), an insulin delivery system for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. The OmniPod System features a small, self-adhesive disposable tubeless OmniPod device which is worn on the body for approximately three days at a time and its wireless companion, the handheld Personal Diabetes Manager. The OmniPod System features only two devices that eliminate the need for a bulky pump, tubing and separate blood glucose meter, provides for automated cannula insertion, communicates wirelessly and integrates a blood glucose meter.

The company earns a huge share of revenues from the Omnipod System in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Israel. It operates in these markets either directly or through intermediaries. In fourth quarter of 2018, the company’s 56.5% of total revenues came from the U.S. Omnipod sales, while 33.4% was generated from the International Omnipod sales.

Drug Delivery Business (10.1% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2018): Insulet has tied up with pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies which use a customized form of the Omnipod System to deliver a drug at a certain administered volume and over a specified period of time.

**Recommendtion:**

Insulet is a buy. Though confident in the reasoning presented, there are many mixed signals affecting this decision. The companies strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, impressive record of earnings per share growth (which show no sign of slowing down), and great cash flow. Unfortunately, the downside risks to these positions are seen in its premium valuation, the performance of the stock itself, and higher debt management risk.

**The Highlights:**

* The Four-Point Strategy Bodes Well:
   *  Insulet has been progressing well with respect to its four-pillar strategy and seems to be well on track to achieve revenues of $1 billion, 70% gross margin and above-market profitability in 2021.
   * Notably, the four key strategic initiatives are expanding Omnipod’s market access, executing on its innovation roadmap, building the U.S. manufacturing facility successfully, and implementing its plan to sell directly in Europe from July onwards.
* Build Out of US Manufacturing Facility:
   * Management seems to be particularly upbeat about the manufacturing unit in Acton, Massachusetts. The company was building it to reduce manufacturing costs, increase capacity to accelerate growth as well as overcome supply shortfall issue. Per management, one line in this new manufacturing facility in the United States will deliver up to 50% of the capacity of its total China operations along with around 90% less headcount.
   * The installation of Insulet’s first highly automated manufacturing line in the United States is expected to begin real soon and the company is also on track to begin production in the new facility in early-2019.
* Omnipod’s Market Access Expansion Continues:
   * Insulet kick-started 2018 with positive reimbursement updates. The company has achieved several milestones with respect to expanding Omnipod’s market access. In this regard, Insulet is already gaining from the limited commercial launch of the Omnipod DASH system.
   * At the end of 2018, Insulet secured approximately a third of Medicare Part D and almost half of all Medicaid covered lives for Omnipod. Thus, along with the in-network coverage for Omnipod through UnitedHealthcare, the company has gained access to the additional 40% of the U.S. diabetes market, where it didn't have presence initially.
   * Providing a boost, Insulet announced the receipt of ISO (International Standards Organization) 27001 certification of its Omnipod DASH System in November 2018.  The company has also received the DTSec (Diabetes Technology Society’s) Cybersecurity Standard for Connected Diabetes Device Security certification for the same. These developments have earned Insulet the status of being the only insulin pump company to be awarded with both the certifications. In the same month, Insulet partnered with Samsung Electronics America, for a Samsung Galaxy smartphone-controlled Omnipod System.
   * Insulet’s Omnipod System was selected as the preferred insulin pump for diabetic patients in the province of British Columbia, Canada, under the expanded British Columbia PharmaCare insulin pump program in July 2018.
   * CMS issued guidance in January which required Omnipod to be covered under the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program. This move expanded the company’s access to around 450,000 individuals with Type 1 diabetes who have Medicare/Medicaid coverage.
* Diabetes Market Boom:
   * An ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle, rising awareness and higher expenditure in healthcare are likely to continue driving the highly competitive diabetes market. Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%.
   * Also, Insulet projects that around one-third of the Type 1 diabetes population in the United States uses insulin pump therapy. It also believes that less than 10% of the Type 2 diabetes population in the United States, who are also insulin dependent, uses insulin pump therapy.

**Risks:**

* Sole Reliance on Omnipod:
   * Insulet’s financial results continue to largely depend on the performance of its lead product — Omnipod System. Per the company, any adverse changes in the market acceptance of the product or worsening of the factors that negatively influence the sale will dent the company’s financials majorly.
* Economic Uncertainty Hampers Growth:
   * Weaker global economic conditions may reduce demand for Insulet’s products, intensify competition, exert pressure on prices, dent supply and lengthen sales cycle. Moreover, a number of countries in Western Europe are facing a liquidity crunch. Insulet is also exposed to the risk of a reduction in healthcare spending in the United States, Canada and Europe due to an economic slump. We are particularly cautious as growth could moderate further if the economic scenario worsens.
* Tough Competitive Pressure:
   * Insulet operates in a highly competitive environment, dominated by firms ranging from large multinational corporations with significant resources to start-ups. Also, the competitive and regulatory conditions in the markets where the company operates limit Insulet’s ability to switch to strategies like price increases and other drivers of cost increases.
   * The company’s Omnipod System primarily competes with Medtronic’s market-leading MiniMed, a division of Medtronic. Notably, MiniMed boasts a major part of the conventional insulin pump market share in the United States. Tandem also has a large market share.",itschrisolson,1556069099,10,7,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bgoi8y/insulet_podd_due_diligence/
The case for Match ($MTCH) [rare gem][WSB exclusive][DD][Serious][Probably NSFW][VG+ OC],"TL;DR: Buy Match calls, then READ THIS POST ASSHOLE because it cost me a lot to write it

# quick facts

Earnings: 5/8 8:30AM (invest now!) (get in early!)

Current: $61.86 (undervalued!) (profit potential++!) (great value!)

PE: 38.45 (lots of upside!) (excellent condition!)

# the love landscape

you know Match for its Tinder app - the #1 highest grossing non game app on planet earth (unbeatable!), but they also own Plenty of Fish, okcupid, pairs, [match.com](https://match.com), Meetic (EU), [ourtime.com](https://ourtime.com), LoveScout (EU), Hinge, and more. Match absolutely dominates the market whether you're looking to get lucky, get married, or just get rejected!

# pay to win relationships

I know you're thinking that's great and all but **show me the money**, how do they make it? unlike other e-darlings that only make money by convincing advertisers there site is worth something (yeah i'm throwing shade and naming names - $FB, $SNAP, $TWTR, $PINS) $MTCH has **real customers.** the best, most loyal customers in the world, the heartbeat of the global economy and the strongest force on planet earth - **thirsty dudes**. thirsty dudes power the economy. there is nothing easier to make money off of than the male sex drive,. that's why sex is everywhere, they use it to sell beer, to sell cars, to sell concert tickets. it's dependable, reliable, and has an unstoppable, unrelenting demand that MTCH is keenly aware of. **MTCH sells sex DIRECTLY** in a way other companies can only dream of.

# discrete rejection

match sells the the dream of love, primarily to guys, but to to girls also. the model is pretty similar to many freemium games - you can play for free, but if you want to find out who is interested in you (impossibly tempting! ) (so enticing!) (how can i resist!) you pay a small fee. if you want to go to the top of results for girls and cut through the clutter, or maybe send a REALLY clear message to that one cutey, match will happily oblige for an affordable price! **You never have to be publicly rejected again** and the cost is actually CHEAPER than going to any bar

# thirsty, clueless dudes

it's the ultimate formula. fear of rejection, fear of approaching, and an unquenchable thirst. much has been said about **female CEO's**. for match **amanda (mandy) ginsburg** is exactly who you want at the helm of this unstoppable match making dynasty. men are for the most part completely unaware or unwilling to accept their own nature, and thus wouldn't be able to turn that primal urge for sex into the maximum profit. mandy has no such limitations and has proven to lead the company to exceptional success. she knows her customers better than they know themselves.

# the lonely generation is the path to unheard levels of wealth and world domination

millenials are [lonelier than ever](https://socalledmillennial.com/2013/10/02/the-loneliest-generation/). 30% of adults in their 30s and 40s are [lonely](https://preview.abcnews.go.com/Health/american-adults-age-45-lonely-national-survey-finds/story?id=58022317), more people are divorcing than ever before. all of this translates into men and women looking for love in all the wrong places. and $MTCH is there for them, already the leader in america and europe, they are now expanding into asia with [world domination](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/call-traders-swipe-match-stock-182914364.html) as the ultimate goal. [over 30% of dates](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/match-ceo-mandy-ginsberg-people-dont-want-to-mix-dating-and-facebook.html)  and [35% of marriages](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/14/3-things-match-group-ceo-amanda-ginsberg-wants-you.aspx) started on an app today, and this number will only rise. 

# what about facebook/bumble/grinder/church/bars?

ok wise guy let's just knock these out one by one.

facebook is a dying website. nobody wants to look for a hookup on the same place where their aunts and grandmas hang out, and facebook DAU and real world usage is going down every day. it's old news.

bumble? match doesn't own this one, it's for the ""enlightened"" ""woke"" millenials/zoomers and requires **the female to send the first message**. while a cute idea, it defies **the basic rules of supply and demand** and in practice leads to boring one liners followed by ghosting. it's a niche that i don't see as a threat.

grinder? real progressive - a dating app not for heterosexuals. NOPE, **TRY AGAIN.**  you want different genders and orientations? [Tinder has 23 of them](http://freebeacon.com/culture/tinder-now-offers-37-genders-claiming-gender-complex-conversation/). Gay is so 2015, two-spirit is the future. Get with the times grinder.

church? [nobody goes there anymore](https://news.gallup.com/poll/248837/church-membership-down-sharply-past-two-decades.aspx).

bars? [same story](https://popcenter.asu.edu/problems/assaultsinbars/).

# the future of match

there's truly so much possible for match. with scientific advances in teledildonics, kinetic and haptic feedback on our devices, and virtual and augmented visual reality on the spatial plane, match can make catfishing and the awkward coffee date a thing of the past. in the future **your entire hookup, from awkward greeting to hookup and walk of shame, will take place on your Match app of choice.** 

# the match dynasty and closing remarks

if you buy Match below $70 you are getting on the ground floor of a revolutionary tech empire and a family dynasty unlike anything seen before. much like genghis kahn, **50% or more** of children born in 2020 will be able to trace their lineage back to a Match app, making the match dynasty the **largest ever known to the human race.**

Match is good for **everyone. it gives its customers hope.** [it makes dating safe for women](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bg8832/short_mtch_dd_inside/), very important in the current climate, and most importantly of all, **it gives its investors wealth beyond imagination.**

the human sex drive is unrelenting. it's recession proof. in a time where true connection is hard to find, it's the ultimate commodity. it is for this reason that Match is more valuable than any oil company, any entertainment company, and any other tech company on this planet, and should have a market cap in line with its world changing goals. it brings me to tears just thinking about it and i'm so happy to be a match shareholder and investor. short match at your own peril. this will be a $70 stock next month, and a $700 stock next year.",keen4e,1556058209,84,72,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bgmlhx/the_case_for_match_mtch_rare_gemwsb/
Microsoft,"$MSFT reports earnings on the 24th after market close. I’m thinking that they’ll beat and maybe get a 5% jump in stock price. 

Over the past two weeks Microsoft stock has grown 29% and their revenue has grown by between 10 and 12% 

Microsoft’s income sources have also grown with 14% more office subscribers, 8% growth in gaming revenue, and 29% growth by LinkedIn. (All of these are from this point last year) 

Last quarter Microsoft beat analyst expectations.  And their cloud platform is catching up to AWS. With all these things considered I will definitely be buying calls.

# Some Thoughts For This Week

***Better late than never, huh?*** Easter guys. Had me busy. Last week was weird though. Totally just kind of a fuck fest of a week, so let's talk about it a bit.

# My Project Update

If you want to stay up to date on the things I'm working on outside of here, follow me on my Reddit profile or feel free to message me.

# How I Pick Plays For Myself

These plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:

* Market cap of $5B+
* Daily volume of 1M+
* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.

# Results On Last Week's Picks

**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Beat on EPS, lowered guidance, stock acted hesitant and got pinned at 30. If you weren't in FD's, you're probably still just fine here. A few guys sent me messages saying they finally turned green on Thursday on this play. Entries/exits matter.

**Atlassian  (TEAM) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Ah this one disappointed me a lot. So they posted a deferred revenue drawdown to slowly decrease over Q3/Q4 and mentioned since they had raised prices people came in too fast last quarter, etc. That being said, they beat EPS, again, like I thought -- but lost. I would say it's definitely a good spot to get long shares and buy the dip, once it shows stabilization. I think 100 is historically a pretty important support level, but I don't remember and don't have any charts up.

**Netflix (NFLX) -** ***BEARISH*** \- So, what happened is somewhat bearish I guess, because Netflix didn't blow its load and just shoot to 400. That being said, I sold a bit of premium on this, and had some short dated calendar spreads to the upside in case they moved but no dice on half of that. I think they kind of sandbagged though, and I don't know if it'll just stay range bound but it's one of the reasons I don't trade Netflix or Tesla, almost ever. I don't like them much as trade opportunities, and I prefer just to buy some shares and understand I'm stuck with them.

**Tilray (EA) -** ***BEARISH*** \- Yo. They printed for me. And I think cannabis puts will, for the most part, print for you too for the next week or so, and then after earnings. I don't know how they're going to try to color their earnings report but holy shit, I think this is finally the quarter when people say, ""Ok, you have to make money now or sell SOMETHING"" because Tilray's given up like 20% in a few weeks now. The Canopy/Acreage deal is interesting, but what will it REALLY do?

# Let's Talk About When To Buy Or Sell Vega

I'm not going to talk too much about this. I'm making some more expanded content on it.

Best tip I can give you: When IV is relatively low, be more willing to buy and take a long position, versus when IV is relatively high, be more likely to take a short position.

Buy IV when it's low, sell it when it's high. That doesn't necessarily mean to sell any options you have if the IV goes up, but it can.

Anyway, let's move on.

# The Picks for Week of April 15th, 2019 [EARNINGS TIME]

**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Microsoft (MSFT) - $128.37 -** ***BULLISH*** \- **They report on Wednesday after hours.** On the tail end of an upgrade but also coming into what historically, has been their strongest quarter for higher earnings surprises/moves around earnings (Q3), I'm bullish on Microsoft. From my estimates, there's a good chance that we see a record quarter for their subscription revenues, and I think a lot of things are just flat out going right. Azure is growing hand over fist, and Office 365 sub base is growing steadily, and I think the company's management is just making good decisions and doing a great job overall. LinkedIn is growing, I haven't done research on how much, but I really like the entire model the company has moved to over the last decade and it seems they can sustain and grow it, also. I expect people to profit take, so pick your poison and entry here before earnings. I don't doubt this stock could be at or above $140 by the end of June, though.

* **Expected Move: $3.60** \- Like I said above, when they've had their biggest earnings moves and surprises, it's been in Q3 historically. Not to say I think they're going to pop 10% or anything, because 99% sure they won't, but $5-$5.50 isn't out of the question.
* **52 Week High: $123.52 -** They're making new highs, I wouldn't be taking the downside on them. Is a pullback possible? Sure, but it doesn't mean it's going to stick.
* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at long dated calls, strictly
* Disclaimer: I am long options for this stock right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Verizon (VZ) - $58.04 -** ***BULLISH*** \- **They report on Tuesday before market open.** Verizon has some headwinds in the 5g market coming, not sure if they can offset their capex spending though. I think I read that it's well over $10 billion for the rest of the year. That being said, I think this is a proxy to Apple and other carriers in the idea that they do payment plans on devices and obviously make some kind of profit on those devices, and we found out sales weren't AS BAD at Apple as we thought there were, which would mean sales weren't AS BAD as we thought they were for mobile carriers.

45% of their revenue is postpaid mobile. Obviously. Their growth in subscribers though is undeniable and there's always more kids with cell phones (I'm not using this as a REASON, just an example of a perpetually growing market). I'm bullish.

* **Expected Move: $1.39** \- I think market makers are underpricing these options, it's the main reason I'm playing it. My modeling shows a $2.25-$2.30 move, which means you're getting a bargain on IV and other things. Who knows by the time Monday I get this posted, though.
* **52 Week High: $61.58 -** They're close to new highs and I want to be in there if they can break through it and rally above.
* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Once again, long expiration calls, with some debit spreads that are a bit shorter.
* Disclaimer: I am long options for this stock right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**UnitedHealth (UNH) - $222 -** ***BULLISH*** \- You can do your own research here but I think this stock is wildly undervaluing this company's assets and potential revenue. I think this stock really has room to run back up, and I have a personal price target of $292 on it. I think it can go even higher, though.

* **52 Week High: $287.94 -** They're SO FAR off their 52w highs and I think that there's just been undue downward pressure and pain on the healthcare industry. I don't BTFD often, but if this isn't a prime place to do it, I don't know what is.
* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Calls with time to play out. Some short term ones near the money, but planning on trading them day to day and just riding the ride up as well as the long game.
* Disclaimer: I am long options for this stock right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tesla (TSLA) - $273 -** ***BEARISH*** **-**  **They report Wednesday after market.** After disappointing delivery numbers, I don't know how Tesla is going to save this quarter with earnings. I don't really think anybody's betting on them to rocket upwards, at all. Elon is a liability, as much as I love the fuckin guy, but there comes a time when you have to say, ""okay, we were ahead of ourselves with buying this shit at $300+"" They just need something as a catalyst, I don't know what their 2 PM announcement will have in the way of autonomous but anything they gain from today's announcement, I expect it to promptly give back with earnings.

* **Expected Move: $19.09 - This could be even bigger by end of day.** It's just going up as I'm watching it right now, but anything they gain in their event will push this number slightly higher, but it could double this in a really shitty ER and normal world.
* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I think this is a prime position to sell premium on calls to the upside. Even if it goes up after earnings, my plan would be to hold them and hope not to be assigned, and buy enough expiration to deal with it in case it does go up. It's always just a matter of time before they go back to $230 because of a car blowing up or somebody saying something stupid.
* Disclaimer: I plan on being short Vega in these.

# State of the Market

We're going to get to those all time highs sooner or later. I hope it's sooner because a lot of plays I have are kind of betting on the short term being to the upside above those highs. I think that there's piles of opportunities right now, and I think we're going to see volatility greatly increase this week and next as May approaches. There's little question that the sideways action represents some type of wide-spreading accumulation and consolidation, so the question is will the people accumulating for the next move upwards on the S&amp;P be stronger than those taking profit? If so, we make all time highs and continue cruising. If not? See you in a few weeks 2,700.

# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks

Correlated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.

# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?

Edit: Not doing this much this week probably.

If you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the post.

**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.

DexCom: this is a diabetes company that makes blood glucose sensors that don't require traditional calibration via finger stick. Totally revolutionized the industry with their G6 continuous glucose monitoring system. Their sensors are used with Tandems insulin pumps and they've partnered with Eli Lilly (
https://provider.dexcom.com/industry-news/dexcom-announces-development-agreement-lilly-integrate-dexcom-cgm-connected-diabetes) and Novo nordisk as well recently. The next gen G7 sensor is in development with Alphabet a development partner. 

The stock has recently taken a beating due to competition from Abbott's freestyle libre system which is similar to DexComs system. There are subtle differences. I believe DexCom makes the superior product by a thin margin. The next generation product, the G7 will likely be far superior to anything on the market.

I think the diabetes market is large enough to support multiple large competitors anyways. 

Earnings are May 1st. I am bullish because I believe outlook on this company is great, Tandem did great with their last earnings and diabetes is rampant. Go long. 


Novartis: 
Can we talk about this company for a sec?

Just take a second and look at that beast of a pipeline. 

Take a look at some of their assets. Some big names include Entresto and Gleevec. I'm super bullish because of their gad Dotatate product Lutathera, used for imaging AND treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. It's some real advanced shit and a real money maker for hospitals. 

Recent shift to focus on high margin products, including sell off of Alcon. Market perceived this as negative for some reason? I'm bullish.

Check the RSI on this company in the teens. 

We're going into earnings soon. This may be the one for FDs, tbh. 


GME:
Come on now. Do I even need to say anything here? This pos going to Earth's core. Their business model is fucked with streaming games coming. Disc-less Xbox to be announced in May, that will be a shot to the knees. The more we hear about Stadia (alphabet's streaming game service) and the likely soon to be announced competition from Amzn, this stock will continue to crater further and further. Moreover, they've guided eps of 0.00 for first quarter. So that nice dividend they've been paying out for so long? That won't be sustainable much longer when their cash flow is negative and the coffers are empty.

Short this shit. Long dated puts as volume allows. 


MCD: 
I'm gonna be honest here. I recently watched the Ray kroc movie on Netflix and fell in love with McDonald's as a company. Ray Kroc was one of us. 

Besides all that, MCD doing some great shit with the drive thru and incorporating AI, data harvesting and all sorts of smart 2019 tech into their restaurants. It's some really innovative stuff. Big data works, just ask Daddy Trump. 

Long dated calls/spreads and shares is the play here. 

They've got earnings coming up, I don't see any particular reason to partake in FD type gambling. Instead, the smart move would be to sell puts at peak IV, as the worst that can happen is you pick up some shares of a great company that's very likely to do well long term. Or buy LEAP calls and sell weekly, OTM calls against those if you're bullish short term.... I'm not even sure why I bother writing this, I know y'all will be buying FD calls at $210 the second the market opens anyways.

Snapchat dd and why it'll never turn profitable also how to wreck it's server costs even further,"Okay so I've been looking around recently and Snapchat doesn't have it's own servers, the ads on Snapchat are completely unprofitable and maybe 1/20 people actually bother clicking them but the biggest thing about Snapchat is that they never built there own data base. 

So that uses up a lot of storage Snapchat has an option to be able to see all your data they have on you, you can request it by going to account dot Snapchat dot com

http://imgur.com/gallery/sMvu5hJ

As you can see Snapchat completely keeps a backup of all the snaps you ever sent so that means either 1 Snapchat I'd going to be selling data, or 2 Snapchat can be in big trouble if it gets hacked imagine all the stuff you did on Snapchat because you thought the snaps were never saved. 

Also I know at least 50 girls under the age 18 that have sent nudes over Snapchat never assuming that Snapchat would back them up. That means Snapchat has the biggest data base of child pornography on the planet. 

Let's assume according to research done over 49% use messaging services for sexting.

22% of girls under the age of 18 has reported sending nude photos while 18% of guys have also.

Roughly 16.4 million kids use Snapchat 12-17 so it's safe to assume that Snapchat has an archive of at least 3.24 million photos of child pornography. Probably has more of we consider that account that Snapchat been around for 7 years now if we did a moving Rolling average that means Snapchat has a minimum of 8.538 pictures containing child pornography.

Now imagine would would happen if Snapchat archives got hacked.

YUM- A completely autistic DD post,"So first of all, let me be blunt- **if you all could see my portfolio, you would NOT take my advice.** ***At all.*** But this WallStreetBets thrives on the autistic, so let's do this.

Last night, after the kids went to bed, I discovered some two-day old Pizza Hut pepperoni pizza sitting in it's box on my kitchen counter. Yesterday had been a particularly crappy day, so I thought, eh, fuck it. I grabbed a slice of the room temperature 'za and... hey, not bad. I mean, I wasn't particularly surprised, because who hasn't had cold pizza at some and been like *Hey, this is alright*. It made me think about Pizza Hut as a brand, and it's holding company, YUM!

Sure, Pizza Hut pizza is arguably even barely pizza. Greasy, hot slab of dough and cheese? Not great. But guess what? Kids eat this shit like a starving herd of Ethiopians at the Sizzler. I bet we have [this crap](https://lenpenzo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pizza-delivery.png) at my house weekly. Sure, I could cook them a healthy meal, but this is America, goddammit.

But it's not just Pizza Hut. Want some poor approximation of fried chicken? YUM runs KFC. Yeah, you can get the Colonels disappointing soggy blend of 11 herbs and spices if you just hate yourself, or one of those godawful Double-Down sandwiches where they replace the bread of a regular sandwich *with fried chicken I mean come on what in the fuck KFC?* But you know what shows up at least once at every potluck? A goddamned red and white striped bucket of room temperature chicken, because someone [couldn't be assed to care](http://i.imgur.com/1ZklJ9B.jpg) enough to make something.

Pulling a late night rager? YUM has you covered with Taco Bell- [The King of late night drunk munchies.](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/15/1561011ba7ed4516e0e3459c6e5cf24faba70a1b748672d48d3b85414a3d2065.jpg) Any combinations of meats shoved in some form of soft or fried tortillas, sometimes covered with Dorito dust, always guaranteed to get some on your shirt.

$CUBI - potential multibagger,"CUBI is a small cap bank which on the surface looks like any other shitty bank ([https://www.customersbank.com/](https://www.customersbank.com/)).

The most interesting part of this business is Bank Mobile, their whitelabel banking solution ([https://www.bankmobile.com/white-label](https://www.bankmobile.com/white-label)) - look at this site.

$NKE long,"Nike made a comeback in 2018 since introducing a collab with virgil abloh in october 2017.  In 2018 they planned a $15bn buy back. The stock price shot up 70% in 2018. The NA region is seeing a 10% Y/Y growth while China producing a 20% Y/Y growth. This is so incredible in an industry where almost all boring retails are dying. Overall $nike is bull because they have taken a step ahead of the retail apocalypse.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2016-2017 nike was struggling because their own lackluster introduction of ""hype"" shoes, core culture pieces that can drive an organic demand and have people line up for days. **Adidas** has been doing OK since they are able to secure kanye west and have given him enough freedom to create his own brand yeezy.  Nike had been doing small collabs here and there but nothing was as loud as yeezys.

&amp;#x200B;

Introduce **Virgil Abloh**, who is now the creator director of LV. It would not be an exaggeration to say he is a main factor that boosted the current sneakerhead hype that we see now. He started a collaboration with nike called the Ten around October 2017,  after that we see $NKE price shot up **70% in a year**. Almost every shoe of this collab is going for $1000+, the best pair out of the pack, the off-white Air Jordan 1 is going for $3000+ today. On top of that old jordan's from before 2017 are seeing hype as well. Now even shoes that used to sit in clearance have resell values. And all kinds of resell hype coming up, new resell stores opening all over the country. Just this year you have solestage, urban necessities opened in NYC, two of the biggest names in resell game.  Solestage did $5mm in sales China's Singles Day with their taobao store. Of course fake shoes are blowing up as well. This one fake seller I know hired a few customer support and sells 300 pairs a day, which translates to $45,000 a day, that is $16mm a year. Yea, fakes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been playing around with bots for a bit. You have teenagers who make buttloads selling softwares for $200 apiece. Or managing ""sneaker groups"" that charge $80 a month on 800 members. In 2017 there was not this kind of craze in bots, and in 2019 there is a new bot coming up every other week.  

All these free publicity  and **hype** is the core reason for nike's insane gain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Behind all this we see Nike's success in **ditching old retail models**. They have been terminating relationships with boring stores and focus on growing a network of boutiques. Off the top of my head you in NYC have Extrabutter, sneakersnstuff, Kith, upnyc. These stores have their own clothing line sometimes while selling a curated selection of sneakers. All of these boutiques have been in business for years and they conduct cultural events that can produce better stickiness. 

&amp;#x200B;

**e-commerce**

Nike's SNKRS app is a core game changer as well. New ways of interaction and releases have people chase down a bus, or digging through the whole app for an ester egg that allows you buy a very special shoe. They are building their own e-commerce channels in all countries. 

&amp;#x200B;

**social media**

On instagram we see a boom of #hypebeasts flexing their supreme box logo shirts wearing thousand dollar jordan's.  The sneaker scene has never been bigger. You would see people flex their jordans on China tiktok. There's also this Chinese app called RED where tons of girls flex their jordans and nikes while affiliate linking to a product page. Basically imagine instagram but on retail steroids.

&amp;#x200B;

**china**

According to [stockx.com](https://stockx.com) , a sneaker resell site, on certain shoes half of their buyers are from china, while a lot of the u.s. buyers could end up in china as well. Now china is embracing the hiphop game more by allowing rap competitions for the first time in history. You see celebrities with millions of followers wearing supreme, jordan's, yeezy's. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Nike just has a great look this year because from the leaks they are remaking a lot of their classic shoes while doing collabs with lots of brands. The growth might not be as crazy as 2018, but definitely there is enough foundation for long calls. Oh, world cup too.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr

SBUX bull here: time to short,"Let me begin by saying I’m a Starbucks bull. It’s my fourth largest holding in terms of stock. It’s been a good year. But it’s time to make a shit ton of money on the pullback. 

A few months back, in November, it blasted through its ATH around $64. It’s been on a steady tear ever since, and for pretty good reason. After being held down by fears that the company has reached its peak and was done growing, it showed steady growth amidst tepid market conditions. But now it’s sitting 17% above its previous ATH, with a couple of weeks until earnings. The question is: what possible results would warrant an additional jump on top of the massive streak it has been on? It’s tough to see this stock breaking $80. 

So what you’ll see is risk averse investors and just opportunistic investors that recognize the steam is running out moving money to safer bets through earnings. That means we are going to see a drop going into ER (in fact, it has already begun). The key to this move was waiting for the stock to peak and show some resistance. It has done so. 

The play: 5/3 $75 puts for $1.25. Sell before earnings with profit to avoid risk, or hold through earnings if you have the balls.",originalmuggins,1555433507,38,45,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdw8gf/sbux_bull_here_time_to_short/
Dropshopping is dead,"$SHOP has gone up over the past year and almost doubled up since the drop of Dec 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

On a daily trading, the stock has gone parabolic and it is currently day 9 on the daily candles which might close with a doji. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a general rule where if a stock holds at a ATH in this case $200 it will hit the $220 mark. (Probably due to algos in modern day)

Greatly overextended, at the upper level of bollingers, I think $SHOP will retrace.

Market Theory:

People will protect their gains and take profit as we hit the top again.

1 in 100 startups successfully launch, drop shipping seems like a super saturated market. With margins thinning due to inflation, there will be less e-comm startups. 

The E-comm world is changing, Brand building &lt; Getting sales, Amazon is so convenient with fulfillment centers, it will cost less to pay for the order fulfillment service than to implement it.

Postage rates have gone up! We are no longer subsidizing Chinese postage.

DD: Trupanion ($TRUP) is a great short-term buy. I was right about $GME and $DIS.,"I called $GME and $DIS and now I'm calling $TRUP.  I'm playing their upcoming earnings.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is ""less than public"" knowledge as in most folks, including most investors, aren't going to know about it -- but it's still public if you know how to use the tools and interpret the information like I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had no idea $TRUP existed until I saw a brochure at my vet's office.  I hate insurance, I'm not a fan of paying for something and getting a piece of paper to keep in my glove box (or wallet) in return.  I don't go to the doctor.  I don't get into car accidents (yet).  I just see some shit come out of my bank account so I can keep my ~~Mercedes~~ ~~Toyota~~ ~~Hyundai~~ GM legal.  I pay $200/mo just in case I fly with $BA and somehow survive a crash and need a doctor.  I love it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, back to $TRUP.  When I was growing up poor we never took our dogs to the vet, we let them roam wild in the country like wolves.  I have to take my pit regularly now because the neighbor keeps requesting his ""up-to-date shot records"" -- I mean, do you need to see them after EVERY bite?   Jesus Christ man.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, pet insurance is something I actually use now.  And considering how much people love their pets, visits to the vet aren't something that take a huge hit in an economic downturn.

&amp;#x200B;

You can read all the stats about why this is and will be a booming industry in their investor presentation:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Other than the great financials here and growth potential (pet insurance is common overseas, not yet adopted in the US yet), consider the information I'm offering.  Check out their organic search traffic over the past quarter (and beyond):

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/dSFJdmq](https://imgur.com/dSFJdmq)

&amp;#x200B;

This is the ""less than public"" knowledge part.  This isn't inside information, this is an approximate of traffic and how it's increased over the past couple of years for Trupanion's main website.  You'll see how it's increased drastically over the past quarter and especially YOY.

&amp;#x200B;

The part of this is that organic traffic -- traffic that arrives on a website through Google, Bing (lol), etc -- is a relatively fixed cost (you pay the people to make it rank well, but the costs don't go up along with the traffic) is pure profit.  It's just money in the bank, they're not paid ads.  Organic traffic is also something that most analysts or ""pro"" investors can't forecast, Google organic search results are updated sporadically and like I said -- this isn't very public knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

Until now.  I'm not suggesting what someone else should do, but I'm personally using this public-but-not-easily-found information to buy medium to long-range calls.  The history of this stock is incredibly healthy.  Not a meme stock.

# Some Thoughts For This Week

So, I ate way too many steak fajitas earlier, and I'm fucking stuffed so I doubt I'll reply to nearly as many people until after I watch Game of Thrones later. That being said -- I got kind of fucked on my own positions by posting the exact trades I planned on taking. Contrary to popular belief, the strikes weren't removed because I was worried about liability, but because my personal entries got inflated, and one of the trades returned 35% that should have returned 90% or more. Unfortunately, I'm not listing my exact strikes or dates because they shouldn't even be pertinent to you. The strikes I pick are based on if I hold long shares in any of the companies, but as well based on my liquidity, risk tolerance, and my personal allocation per play. You should learn that stuff on your own, to be frank.

# How I Pick Plays For Myself

These plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:

* Market cap of $5B+
* Daily volume of 1M+
* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.

# My Project Update

I have some things in the works. I'm still working on the small account challenge, and some other things. I don't really like, nor use Twitter, but I may start one so you can get updates on it elsewhere, we'll see. I have a couple other things in the pipeline, so if you want to know more about them, feel free to message me. I don't want to make this post about my ventures outside of here. Let's get to fucking betting bois.

# Results On Last Week's Picks

**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \- Company is shit, just like I thought. They beat earnings but as I said last week, I had both FD's and May/Junes. The May/Junes I'm bagholding like Michael Burry because I just don't believe in it. They beat EPS estimates but as some of you saw me post, the company is just flat out shit. The things I already knew came to light, their balance sheet is wacked and they're predicting low single digit long term growth (IE: inflation anybody?). I'll probably sell them and roll them in the upcoming days because I really think this stocks going to pull a JCPenny, hopefully before July. The short float's still insane, so it may Roku out and rebound, we'll see.

**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Definitely beat earnings like I thought they would, they're not exposed to the Boeing stuff, and unfortunately, they couldn't hold the big gains and we saw some profit taking from shareholders. After consolidation, I would assume they continue to rise, so I have May contracts still -- and I plan on watching and deciding what to do here. I sold some of them right at open for 50%.

**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH***  \- Twitter had high points and low points, the market was really a sideways clusterfuck all week except for some segments, but I found a couple good entries and made a couple profitable trades on it still. Had two go completely to zero, though.

**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** \- They already started their claw back to 400+. Enough said here, I don't think it's surprising, at all. If it wasn't for Boeing's drop, Dow would be at all time highs nearly.

**Snap (SNAP) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Well, those people still holding puts from months ago probably hate this stock more than ever. Until it hits 17, I don't see it slowing down. It pulled back pretty hard after it rose, and it may still, but I wouldn't try to time its pullbacks.

**Macy's (M) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Yo fuck this stock for real. I made a pile on it a week or so ago when it crested 26, and I really thought it was done with this gain/give back consolidate shit. Wednesday I bought 24.50 puts at right as it broke down after open, and they paid well. I also had 24's that went to 0. I'm done playing this stock until it shows some balls and conviction.

# Let's Talk Entries/Exits

Okay boys and girls, I'm going to do some educating really quickly.

In your day to day trading if you act on emotion: Stop.

If you see a stock shoot up 5% after open and you FOMO it and it's been 10 minutes since the bell rang: Stop.

If you didn't play Disney: You should have.

If you decide to do some investigating and pick plays to make this week, don't feel obligated to open your positions Monday first thing. Likewise, you should never really open positions within the first 15-20 minutes of trading for a day. It's likely (like with SPY often) that the peak it achieves during open will be the biggest swing you will see for the day, and it's likely there's the least conviction behind it.

When I pick an entry point, I look at the trend I'm following, I look at the stock, I decide where I think it can reach, what I'm willing to bet that it does, and what kind of swing I'm playing for.

This brings me to earnings season: Normally, I'm looking to get into positions at least a week before an earnings report because I'm taking on a vega advantageous position (the increase in it, specifically), but I had bad planning that week.

And at the end of the day, none of that matters this week. **BECAUSE ITS EARNINGS SEASON LETS** ***GOOOOOOOOOOOO.***

&amp;#x200B;

# The Picks for Week of April 15th, 2019 [EARNINGS TIME]

**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**

This week I'm changing up how I do this. I'm offering the info that I see pertinent to the play I plan on making and if somebody decides to do their own DD and makes a similar trade, I won't always get dicked on my entries.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bank of America (BAC) - $30.17 -** ***BULLISH*** \- **They report on Tuesday before open.** At this point, for me to bet against the banks it'd take a lot of conviction that a certain bank has a certain problem they can't overcome. People are borrowing like crazy still, we saw how strong the entire sector was Friday, and although Bank of America's been on a tear as of late I still think it has potential to really break above a long time range it's been stuck in. They popped hard on the other financial reports, but I don't think that diminishes their possibility to go further. They may correct in the day before earnings, so I'm going to look hard for a good entry. Market 

* **Expected Move - $1.04** \- I think this is low. I think we can see a $1.50 move on earnings day, and I think that as long as orange man doesn't say stupid shit, we can probably tack on another 1-2% the rest of the week.
* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**
   * FQ2 18 $28.55 -&gt; $29.78
   * FQ4 18 $26.55 -&gt; $28.45 
* **52 Week High: $31.91 -** This is important, because it's approaching a point where if it can get past this, we may see new money flood in and help push it higher. It all depends on volume and conviction though.
* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at FD's and longer dated calls on this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Atlassian (TEAM) - $112.68 -** ***BULLISH*** \- **They report on Wednesday after close.** One of my businesses is a large scale development project, we have roughly 10 devs/designers/team members. We've been using Atlassian products for like 7 years. Every time something else pops out that integrates cleanly, we try it, often buy it. They've been getting subscriptions from me forever, and I'm grandfathered into a good plan on one of them. The fact is their culture/infrastructure/family of products pulls you in and doesn't let you go. Knowing a lot about the company personally, having a lot of experience with it and knowing how crucial it is to so many people, I assume their churn rate is pretty low historically/projected to stay low. This company is really on the come up. I'm bullish.

* **Expected Move - $9.86** \- They're a growing company and each time they prove it, they gain hand over fist. This might be exuberant -- but I really do think they have potential to become a $200 stock in the next 12 months.
* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**
   * FQ1 18 $40.25 -&gt; $50.17 (25% HELLOOOO)
   * FQ4 18 $66.83 -&gt; $73.84
   * FQ1 19 $81.89 -&gt; $70.18 (by 11/28, a month later, it was exploding back above this price and basically fucking ignored the December selloff)
* **52 Week High: $116.70 -** It solidly retraced its December lows back upwards, and has hesitated barely, with the regular gain/consolidate pattern upwards. I don't think it's slowing down.
* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at calls both FD's for the earnings move and Junes at a wide spread apart. I'm going to give the long dated ones room to play as a lotto ticket for as cheap as I can get them and assume the trend continues, and play the FD's for at least a 200% gain based on the move that is priced in being smaller than I think they'll gain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Netflix (NFLX) - $351.14** ***- BEARISH*** \- **They report on Tuesday after close.** So, Netflix is a touchy subject for me. I've bet against them twice, and lost heavily on both plays. I bet for them, and lost both also. I basically was backwards both times. While I think they appropriately guided last time based on them saying most growth would be international for their last quarter, I think that Disney's meteoric rise on Friday followed by them losing 4.5% was an indication of the multiple this stock trades at -- and sentiment that people really think that Disney is a challenger. Once Apple actually announces their streaming specifics, I think they will be a contender also. That being said, I think a lot of people are of the belief that there is room for everyone, and while that's true, I see inevitable growth slowing with Netflix over the next two years because of the other companies entering the market. Not negative growth, but a curb of their exponential growth, and the need to spend more to acquire -- means lower EPS. I don't think the company will necessarily ever really fall to #2 in the department, but I think the stock is pretty overvalued right now unless they find a means to leverage their subscribers for more money. They can only raise prices so often though.

That all being said - once again, the entire economic situation seemed dire last quarter -- but I think of it this way: People knew that they weren't cancelling Netflix. You may buy less cars, you buy cheaper toilet paper, you don't cancel Netflix, because most people that come home from their shit job or tough day need it. They live for it. I don't think the economic situation really affects this company, and thus, they're at a PE of fucking 140. How far can this company really go? Can they get a billion subscribers? I just don't see that happening, I really don't.

They're also going to shell out $3 BILLION DOLLARS this year. That's almost double 2016, and a billion over 2017. That's a lot of dough man, and if their growth isn't still exponential, how do they plan to start increasing their free cash flow. It's on a downward spiral, so what's the deal? They just stop paying for content? Can't. Management says they will, but how the fuck will you keep the buzz going for the service with the introduction of two competitors? New people to streaming won't just automatically buy Netflix now, Disney or Apple may be the first stop. Stop advertising? Maybe, but that's probably a fraction of what they spend on infrastructure and content.

Long story short, I'm betting against them in two ways.

* **Expected Move - $25.30** \- It could be way more, or way less than this. They may give away 10% and rally it back in two days. This stocks just so volatile around their earnings reports.
* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**
   * FQ2 17 $161.70 -&gt; $183.60
   * FQ4 17 $227.58 -&gt; $250.29
   * FQ2 18 $400.48 -&gt; $379.48
   * FQ4 18 $351.39 -&gt; $339.10
* **52 Week High: $423.21 -** This stocks just really overvalued in my opinion. I understand their subs are worth something but I think before it gets back here, it's going to trace back below $300 at some point.
* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm playing one or two at the money contracts on this probably, and maybe a way OTM straddle in May, but I'm not sure. It takes serious balls to bet against this stock, and it takes serious balls to play it period because the options are definitely appropriately priced, if not over priced, and it's a way to just light a bunch of fucking money on fire. It's earnings season though.

&amp;#x200B;

**EA (EA) - $101.83** ***- BULLISH*** \- **They report on 5/7/19 after close.** I'm looking to start setting up some multi-leg and long term plays here. The fact of the matter is, I play Apex occasionally. I hate battle royale games, but I fucking love that game. My friends and I get fucked up and play once a week or so after we all get done working/with meetings. There is almost no chance they thought this game would blow up like it has, and regardless of the pull back in Twitch viewership, Apex did in 4 weeks what took Fortnite 16. Obviously, they share player bases, but I don't think it matters. Games cycle through this industry, and it's gone from PUBG, to H1Z1, to Fortnite, and I think Apex will continue making the company more money in the first year than they forecasted.

* **My Target For Lotto's - $130-$140 by September** \- They could hit this mark in the weeks after earnings, even. I think we'll see a rise in the coming weeks, especially if the software sector pops or gets any good news.
* **52 Week High: $151.26 -** Seems this sector has lagged a bit on the recovery from December. I think that speaks to the room it has to run. Not really betting against it, more kids are born every day, and they floss their way around the house when I'm at family functions. Fuck, when I was a kid I just put olives on my fingers and ate them.
* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm going to start accumulating cheap lotto options in big lots, that are quite a ways out of the money. I plan to add to my position slowly, and then liquidate some near earnings if the move starts running my way. I'll probably buy some FD's for the earnings week expiration, the week before, and if all works out, roll it into shares or more calls and ride it as long as I can.

# State of the Market

We're approaching all time highs still and I'm pretty confident we'll be achieving them. Almost every company guided low for this quarter, and we're seeing slowly the economy wasn't nearly as bad as we thought. Evidence: Financial earnings on Friday. I think that we'll see a 3:1 or 4:1 beat/miss rate, and betting the upside during earnings this season is going to be pretty easy to profit. Doesn't mean I'm blindly yolo'ing the upside, but I'm definitely leaning that way if I'm ever on the fence. Unless it's Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. That company is shit.

# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks

Correlated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.

# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?

Edit: Not doing this 

If you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the post.

**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.

Disney+ is yet another win for Amazon,"It's publicly known that Hulu, along with the rest of Disney, is hosted on AWS.  AWS also manages traffic for the two largest streaming services in the world (Netflix and Amazon Prime) which combined make up 18.5% of all internet traffic.  

Disney is [posting new jobs](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/job/new-york/associate-software-engineer/391/11508553) under their ""Disney Streaming Services"" business with AWS listed under the preferred qualifications, which is evidence that they're looking to further this partnership.  This contract is another growth opportunity for Amazon in their highest margin business.

Investors seem to like the idea of Disney+ for parents, with kids constantly streaming their movies, Disney Channel, superhero movies, etc.  We've seen from YouTube numbers that kids [literally just sit on the app watching the same computer-generated content over and over](https://qz.com/1500662/the-world-of-kids-on-youtube-is-wild-weird-and-almost-entirely-unregulated/).  I think this will skew Disney+ bandwidth requirements way up, giving them similar numbers to Netflix even if they only have half the subscribers.

Your Chance to Become an Oil Baron,"Things are getting spicy(er) in the oil market. I've been long oil since about mid-December, but in my opinion the geopolitical risks are really starting to heat up, and the recent uncertainty leaves me at a crossroads. If the factors play out as below, the price of oil could moon, but outcomes are far from certain meaning this thing could get choppy and trade sideways for a while. That being said, my suggestions are somewhat of a YOLO trade to capture the potential upside.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I'm more certain of/things we already know:

For domestic oil inventories we should start to see significant inventory draws as crack spreads have widened, which should increase refinery utilization rates, and the spill in the Houston ship channel has been cleaned up allowing exports to increase from recent weeks. US production is still high (12.2M bpd), however we saw a 90K bpd reduction in output in January, a surprise slowdown. Further, rig counts tracked by Baker Hughes, which tracks active drilling rigs putting in new wells, has dropped by a total of 50 for the year. However, drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) are still numerous, so it'd be bold to point to this as a sure sign of slowing US production. Lastly, we just began driving season (Apr-Sept), which will increase demand here in the states.

Supply continues to tighten, and the demand fears we have been seeing since BOY have alleviated quickly (something I think has been overlooked). The most glaring catalyst in the market has been the OPEC+ cuts of 1.2M bpd, most notably Saudi Arabia who has cut more than they originally promised, bringing actual cuts to over 1.5M bpd in March. On top of that, Venezuela is getting fucked by U.S. sanctions, political turmoil, as well as problems with their power grid causing blackouts and therefore dramatic production decreases. As it stands they are producing 600M bpd less than they did last year. It's still tbd to see what happens with the Iranian waivers, which I'll touch on more below. Overall, the global supply/demand picture is balanced to slightly restricted as of now. Opinions on supply and demand moving forward vary quite dramatically and projecting oil S/D in this environment is essentially a guessing game. Below are good examples of why projections are so hard to figure. These are also factors I see having the most impact on prices moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

The question marks:

1. Recently, Libyan oil production of over 900K bpd has been essentially reduced to a coin flip. With them being on the verge of a renewed civil war, a huge risk to the supply side is up in the air. It's hard to see things between the two sides working themselves out anytime soon, so the question is will the opposition target oil fields, pipelines, etc. to financially hinder the other side. It was reported today that the Saudi government offered financial support to the aggressor, Khalifa Haftar, which he accepted.
2. Iran export waivers. This one is a catch-22 for the Trump administration. On one hand, he has been trying to bring oil prices down one tweet at a time. On the other, he wants Iranian exports to go to zero. He can't have both. If he ends the waiver program, disallowing countries to buy Iran crude, this would be a considerable hit to the supply side and therefore pressure prices higher. The waivers are set to expire early may if no extension is granted. Sec. of Energy Rick Perry and others have called for them to expire, the Trump administration has demurred.
3. OPEC meeting on June 25. Up until this point, Saudi Arabia has been vocal about wanting to extend OPEC cuts through the end of 2019. Russia, on the other hand, has been less enthusiastic. If Libyan production disappears and Iran gets eighty-sixed from the export market, I could see production cuts coming to an end. We will get more transparency as time passes as Saudi Arabia has been wont to do in previous run-ups to these meetings, but still tbd.

&amp;#x200B;

I want it to be said that I believe oil should continue to climb as any one of these factors playing out in favor of the bulls should have a significant impact on the supply side. However, I was much more confident in a normal long position back in December. Now, I'm looking to capture the potential upside with an emphasis on options and a modest long position. Love em or hate em, OPEC makes things easier in this market IMO. Saudi has been in ""do whatever it takes mode"" (their words) to raise prices and they need \~$85 Brent to balance their budget. The trend is your friend here. For me I look to sell my options end of June at the latest. A lot will happen between now and then, so it will be time to digest and re-assess at that point.

$TRUP - They're going to report HUGE earnings. I'm buying calls.,"I think $TRUP is about to post HUGE numbers in early May (5/7) that'll destroy last quarters and YOY earnings.  It'll be unexpected, the driving catalyst for these larger than expected numbers are a couple of very large ""Google updates"" that occurred over the past quarter -- something that nobody outside of Google can anticipate or forecast.  These updates drastically improved search engine rankings and positions for Trupanion for pet insurance related keywords.

&amp;#x200B;

Web savvy people can use publicly available tools to look at the estimate traffic for [Trupanion.com](https://Trupanion.com).  Organic search traffic has shot up drastically over the past several months, 30-40% from just a few months ago.  50% from the same time last year.  The popularity for ""pet insurance"" and related searches in general has skyrocketed over the past few years -- it's fairly easy to look at this too if you know what you're doing.  Google Trends is the most basic of said tools:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=pet%20insurance](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=pet%20insurance)

&amp;#x200B;

The beauty of increased organic traffic is that it equates to more eyeballs/sales but it has fixed costs, other than a team or guy doing ""SEO"" for your site.  It's printing money when these updates occur.

  
The importance/value of web/organic traffic varies wildly of course, all depends on your customer acquisition and whether visitors to your site translates into sales -- for a service like Trupanion, whether they market online or offline, organic site visitors is an incredible indicator of how sales/popularity are currently trending.

$NBEV - The Big Short pt2,"The news broke today that New Age Beverages partnered with Walmart to get 3 of their drinks on the shelves and be sold. Being a follower of NBEV for a while (to play the pot hype) I assumed the deal was for their CBD Marley drinks. I'm sure I wasn't alone in this. 

  
However I did some more research and it's not for their CBD drinks. It's just their healthy-alternative drink options. I can't see any justifiable way for a stock to boost 40% for healthier drinks. I think the news was delivered sketchily, and most people believe it was their CBD drinks and bought in to the hype. As anyone who has followed NBEV would know, this stock runs and dies on hype around their CBD Marley drinks.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the stock could still run more due to people FOMOing in and shorts covering. But this stock was already in a steady decline from the huge bubble that formed on it back in Sept '18, and everyone knows its overvalued (but we all wanted to play on the pot hype). Well this news isn't about the pot hype. It's about ""healthy drinks"". This is America, we don't care about health, goddamn it! This stock is going to crash back to $5 or below without any news on their CDB drinks.

Argument for DIS,"less versed in company fundamentals, but here is argument for DIS calls.

Would love to hear some opposition to this.

&amp;#x200B;

Streaming Platform:

Investor day is Thursday, April 11th. This should increase volatility regardless of what they are showing, but it happens to be all but confirmed that they will be showcasing Disney+ streaming platform.

Now, this is not entirely revolutionary platform as they already have established ESPN+, but it provides strategic advantage to DIS as it will hold existing as well as potential content that competitors such as Apple, Netflix, CBS, etc cannot. And yes they have already announced plans to remove their existing content from Netflix. Personally, I have no idea why they are not presenting unified platform with all content or even piping all these services through Hulu (which they own majority stake in), but I suspect this is a future play for them.

Based on AAPL announcement, stock rose 8% (month of March alone) and is continuing to go up (\~12%). Apples compelling argument is bundling service packages. No content specific buzz that I am aware of as of now.

&amp;#x200B;

EndGame (movie):

Right off the bat, Avengers Endgame is already crushing records on presales and managed to cause outages on Fandango and AMC sites. I wasn't versed in how stock reacts to movie releases so I just looked at stock reaction after their major blockbusters released just to see if their is any correlation. I am choosing highest grossing blockbusters as my assumption is EndGame will easily fit in that category. I'd like to normalize numbers in a way that includes hype up to move as I believe a lot of the times stock price reacts well before movie is release, but this is what I'm going with for now.

**Movie/Gross Earnings/Release Date/$DIS Stock Movement 2 Weeks After Release**

* Star Wars Force Awakens / $247,966,675 / 12.18.15 / (-1%)
* Black Panther / $202,003,951 / 2.16.18 / (+1%)
* Avengers: Infinity War / $257,698,183 / 4.27.18 / (+3%)
* Marvel's The Avengers / $207,438,708 / 5.4.12 / (+3%)
* Star Wars The Last Jedi / $220,009,584 / 12.15.17 / (+3%)
* Incredibles 2 / $182,687,905 / 6.15.18 / (+1%)

Based on numbers, there is a slight lift. Not completely significant, but again my expectation is that End Game blows these records out of water. That and the combined news of streaming should move stock up significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple things to call out that I have not researched as much:

* Park revenue: have not even looked into this in anyway
* Q1 Guidance from DIS: they have already said Q1 earnings (May 8(?)) will be lower as they plan to invest in streaming platform
* Movie net revenue: though I expect the new EndGame movie to crush gross income record, I also know they are floating around a $500M cost of making this one and the last one. Will probably look into net profit as an indicator next.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know thoughts on this and anything else you think I should look into for analysis.

**Read this next:** **You don't have to believe, agree with, or go with any of these picks.** These are the picks I'm watching this week and plan on potentially making plays into depending on if my dick is hard in the morning. If you do decide to take these trades, I plan on getting into them as well. Trade at your own risk, **this is not investment advice, it's simply a transcription of my own notes that I'm willing to share.** *When I use the term YOLO play,* ***it doesn't necessarily mean FD's,*** because some tickers are light on option chains. Out of the trades listed, the YOLOs may have the most upside percentage gain potential but probably the most risk. **I will not give you advice on your own situation, nor on what you should do with a particular position.** Do your own due diligence. 

# Some Thoughts For This Week

I'm going to start by reiterating the same shit I said last week, except this week, I'm going to be a bit more cold hearted about it. When you enter or exit a trade is your OWN DEAL. I cannot and will not give you advice on any of your own trades or positions. This is part of the learning process. Moreover, trading is about simply selling something for more than you bought it for. I don't have any hard and fast rules I follow, I simply do it by feel and intuition.

# How My Picks Are Generated

These plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money. Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:

* Market cap of $5B+
* Daily volume of 1M+
* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

# Results On Last Week's Picks

**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \- I played this harder than some of my other picks. It didn't do nearly as well as Bank of America early in the week, but overall, it did good. I'm still bullish on Twitter, and personally think it's busting out of some long term consolidation. It peaked almost 10% from the start of the week, my spreads worked out, I am personally holding a few longer termed contracts.

**Gamestop (GME) -** ***BEARISH*** \- So, they definitely ate shit on earnings, I sold half my contracts at open and the other half basically broke even because of IV. I wasn't looking to hold them and watch the company drive into the ground, made an okay profit, but I was hoping the bottom would fall out after earnings. Either way, the company is not looking well and is eventually going to 0 or getting acquired.

**Aurora Cannabis (ACB) -** ***BULLISH*** \- This one didn't really work out for me. I've been averaging down anyway because I'm stubborn and I think it's going up, but, whatever - can't all be two and three baggers.

**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Did exactly what I presumed it would. I'm not in any positions on this anymore, but it's staying on my radar. I expect financials to do well in the coming weeks, so I may randomly jump into it intraweek if I am feeling spicy.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Picks for Week of April 8th, 2019

**All of the commentary on specific plays are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each contract listed is not a suggestion to buy, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \- This company is a gigantic mess. They set extremely high guidance for whatever reason last time around, and I highly doubt that they're going to meet it. Their margins are awful, and the only reason we'd see activists going after the board is if the inner workings of the company were crumbling. I'm playing this as an earnings play, I'm already in some puts for it, and plan on being in more depending where movement goes this week pre-earnings. Even if they do somehow magically rise off their call, I'm bag holding them. It seems that with poor earning calls, the stock moves violently, sometimes as much as 20%. Market makers seem to be pricing in about a $2 move, which to me, is reasonable, but it could move as much as $3-$3.50 in my opinion based on everything going on.

* **Short term earnings YOLO: 4/18 $16.50 puts @ $0.37 or $15.50 puts @ $0.17**
   * I'm likely not bag holding these past earnings more than a couple hours after open Thursday. The $15.50 puts is a complete lotto ticket, kind of the $16.50's too but after the last couple weeks I'm feeling spicy and I might decide to throw a couple hundred at it and see if we can reverse that massive gap up they had earlier this month. 10-bagger territory potential. I expect to take these to 0 if they beat earnings by some miracle.
* **Longer term: 5/17 $16 puts @ $0.62 or $15 puts @ $0.38**
   * Not sure what I'll do with either of these, depends on price action on Thursday after open.

&amp;#x200B;

**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \- They released some pretty killer news with their fuel costs potentially being flat, and even though they ran hard, I think it's got a ways longer to go. That news however is kind of concerning, almost as though to me they may be protecting against a bad earnings report. Either way, not enough for me to not bet on them. The stock trades at a very reasonable valuation, and they also don't have any 737 Max 8's in their fleet which kind of exempts them from being vulnerable to the production slowdowns Boeing just announced.

* **YOLO: 4/12 $59 calls @ $0.60**
   * IV is surprisingly low on these. Not sure why.
* **Short term: 4/26 $61 calls @ $0.46**
   * If earnings go well, I'd assume they continue climbing throughout the month, so bumping the strike a couple bucks seems reasonable for me.
* **Long term: 6/21 $67.50 calls @ $0.22**
   * I hold the same reasoning for potentially buying these as I do for the 4/26's, if they rise, and do well, they should keep rising on good guidance. Whether they can tack on all the way to expiration, idk, but there's probably a point I can find to exit these at a profit, and they're cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \- I'm still bullish on Twitter. Check out the last couple weeks of posts for the reasons. 

* **YOLO: 4/12 $35 calls @ $0.45**
   * If I decide to enter these, I'm going to be really attentive and micromanage the position, averaging down and potentially exiting if it goes against me.
* **Short term: 4/18 $35.5 calls @ $0.48**
   * Giving up .50 of strike spread and paying only a few bucks for it seems reasonable. I'm more tempted to play here, honestly.
* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.81**
   * If I play these, I'm going to be mindful around earnings, and perhaps manage this and jump out/in depending on any news/movement. If I'm really bullish, this would prove my position though huh

&amp;#x200B;

**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** - So they said they're cutting production. Big whoop. They have piles of free cash flow, get a government contract every other week, and we've proven the $380 level to be pretty solid support. I imagine this claws it's way back to $400ish within a couple of weeks. For me, it's a true BTFD. I got lucky and cashed out debit spreads/calls on Friday morning so I didn't eat the downturn, either.

* **Short term: 4/18 $397.5 calls**
   * Probably micro managing these as well, just seems like they're so volatile there there could be a lot of building into the position/averaging the cost in order to see a solid profit here. I don't know the price because they gapped down like a mother fucker after hours on Friday.
* **Long term: 6/21 $450 calls @ $2.22**
   * This is the strike where it seems each $5 jump matters - these will likely be cheaper than listed, and offer a good chance. I don't plan on holding these until expiration unless the stock just explodes upward and I feel like I have enough cushion to sustain any bad news that may possibly come, although I still think the verdict is out and shit is priced in. I think the algo sell off on Friday will just rebound back up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Snap (SNAP) -** ***BULLISH*** \- I know this sub loves to hate this stock, but I don't really care about their underlying business model. They also announced some semi-cool tech that will keep the white girls on the app longer on weekends, and it still stands as the easiest way to set up a way to chat to your mistress. Because of this -- they will likely survive just fine, even at a loss. The user base has to be worth something.

* **ITM play: 4/12 $12 calls @ $0.26**
   * I'm considering getting long shares and this seems like a decent price to pay to be able to watch and wait and see what happens this week.
* **YOLO: 4/12 $12.50 calls @ $0.12 or $13 calls @ $0.06**
   * They really don't have to go that far for these to profit and if there's any week they MIGHT rally through the recent gains, it would be this one.
* **Long term: 5/24 $14 calls @ $0.44**
   * Most likely not holding these to expiration, unless I see the type of run I'm expecting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Macy's (M) -** ***BULLISH*** \- I didn't post this one last week, but I definitely benefited off their run on Thursday and walked into it by luck because I was about to liquidate my calls I had, and then noticed they were running really hard. I think that it's poised to keep running this week for multiple reasons and the options are dirt cheap based on a few factors.

* **Short term/YOLO: 4/18 $26 calls @ $0.39, 4/12 $25.5s @ $0.46 or 4/12 $26 @ $0.24**
   * If I go back in on any of these (I had $24.50's this week I sold on Thursday) then I'm going to monitor this stock closely. It's been consolidating like none other and could really be poised to gain some back, more importantly, the company is valued reasonable, trading at a decent ratio, and the options are pretty cheap.
* **Long term: 8/16 $30 calls @ $0.78**
   * If my thesis is right and I decide to go this route, I'm likely holding them and just accepting what happens for the next few months because if the stock at any point tacks on a significant amount, they could really skyrocket in value.

# My Current Project

I'm thinking of streaming a small account challenge 3 days a week (Tues, Weds, Thurs) on Twitch (1k-&gt;50k). I don't know though, I'll let you know if anything comes of it and I decide to do it and if I do, mods will have to approve it first. It's working out alright thus far, and I don't do much trading on Robinhood so I figured I would do something with some YOLO bucks to see what I can do. Part of it is to prove that people don't need 25k to make money trading, PDT isn't holding people back, and there's ways to increase a small account quickly without as much risk as some people take. We'll see if this comes to fruition or not.

# Stocks That Could Be Worth A Look

**Bullish:** Hostess (TWNK), Cars dot com (CARS), Banco Bilbao (BBVA), Humana (HUM), Cypress Semi (CY), Nordstrom (JWN), Hanesbrands (HBI), Fox Corp (FOXA), American Eagle (AEO)

**Bearish:** Skechers (SKX), Home Depot (HD), Urban Outfitters (URBN), TJX (TJX), KB Home (KBH), Pagseguro Digital (PAGS), Citigroup (C), Navient (NAVI)

# State of the Market

We're nearing all time highs right now, so one of two things is going to happen after the beginning of the week in my opinion. I say we start the week green, we'll quickly get to the all time high levels and test. If we get lucky and orange man says something good about the trade talks, it could provide the lift we need to get over it and keep going. The other choice, is we either see consolidation like we did for two days last week, trade mostly sideways, teeter around, and pull back slightly before resuming upwards to test it again. I plan on being really mindful of my positions and at any sign of a sell off like the one that occurred a couple of weeks ago - I may go to cash and evaluate.

# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks

Correlated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.

# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?

If you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, and so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the thread. 

**Stocks I won't cover or comment on (because they're just too ridiculous):** This week, none

**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.

&amp;#x200B;

**Private Messages/Chat Requests:** I'll likely ignore most of these. I got like four hundred last week? I trade during the day, so I can't be bothered to be responding thoughtfully when I have 15 charts on my screen.

TA/Algo DD,"Results from 4-5 Predictions: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b9pt4d/daily\_discussion\_thread\_april\_05\_2019/ek74ffc?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b9pt4d/daily_discussion_thread_april_05_2019/ek74ffc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

If you haven't seen my posts in the daily or weekend threads, I've been working on creating a LSTM neural network in python to attempt to predict stock prices. I've had several messages asking about the script as well as I've noticed some comments in the weekend thread looking for some sort of TA thread were people can share plays and talk about strategies.

So I figured I'd make a post about my relatively new strategy and answer any questions as well as provide a place for people to critique/shit post my method if they so choose. 

Here are some predictions for tomorrow I made this morning- [https://imgur.com/a/j8SL88v](https://imgur.com/a/j8SL88v)

Plays for tomorrow based off my forecasts:

1.  I like to combine my model's forecast with TA to form plays, and I see some TA to back up the models forecast for NVDA. [https://imgur.com/a/UP2QcKr](https://imgur.com/a/UP2QcKr). Bearish divergence on the hourly chart for both the AO and the RSI. If this play doesn't work out intraday I'm fine holding for several days. Looking for a mid day rally in NVDA with overbought RSI on 5 or 15 min charts for a entry into puts. However, If I see signs of slowing momentum early, I might pull the trigger in the first 30 min-1 hour. Probably looking at 5/17 190s.
2. See a similar story with AAPL, bearish divergence on the RSI, not as clear in the AO but we do have two red ticks at the end of the histogram. [https://imgur.com/a/kCgR8SJ](https://imgur.com/a/kCgR8SJ). Going back to my forecasts, I'll be looking to get in to some puts 15-30 minutes after open. Right now I have my eye on 5/17 195s. Same story with NVDA, if I don't get the move I'm looking for, perfectly happy holding as I see some signs of slowing momentum on the daily charts.

Feel free to comment your own TA, critique my model/TA, or just as questions. I've gotten a lot of helpful feedback about my model from the daily thread so looking forward to some more feedback. Important note, this model is still very young and I make no guarantees of it being bug free so take that into account when looking at the predictions.

Firstly, on the way to school I pass by 4 Starbucks locations, not including the one in Target, and their drive thrus are always filled. Never have I seen a single car or two in 1 drive thru. There's usually at least 8 in 1 drive thru. To add, I have a handful of classmates who always come in with a large Starbucks coffee and even the professor. 

Second, kids as young as 4 years old are getting drinks for themselves. One day I saw a woman with 2 kids in Target and each had their own drink. Little kids are getting addicted. Anything to stop the kids from crying.

CVS and Aetna - Insight on the business moving forward.,"I’m literally on the toilet at work right so I’m not going to be pulling up any statistics or anything. 

My best friend is a director at a regional hospital network in the Midwest, he’s just below AVP. I was asking him about CVS due to the amazing drop that’s happened since last quarter and here are his findings.

I’m long at 5/17 55C, 6/21 57.5 and 60C

Hospital space, care and costs are one of the most prohibitive financially to bottom line growth. People do not trust pharmacies yet for care and this especially true in America. This merger as the CEO just said is going to pipeline all care to lower cost alternatives and start generating an ecosystem of care and profit.

Deborah, 68, who has had her 6th flu this month, refuses to stop eating cake and lemonade at church on Sundays, continues to get sick and goes to the emergency room. This is expensive for Deb and hospitals. Deb hates going to the hospital but loves knowing everyone’s name there. “I’m back again”. Deb is poor supporting her family so you have no clue when she is going to pay her full bill despite insurance.

Deb needs to simply get a prescription from a nurse practitioner at a CVS pharmacy, that can be filled at the CVS pharmacy right there. Quick bill for care, quick pharmacy fill, better patient time and outcome. Deb also has 21 grand children and two great grandchildren (use a condom in high school), she gets a bunch of pedalyte at the store too just in case. Win win win.

Yes, apparently pharmacists hate working at CVS and vent on Reddit. People vent about their daily jobs a lot. That isn’t a reason to sell a stock.

Let’s say Deb is now not considering the hospital as her needs have been met this month. The hospital has less patients, costs can be cut with labor, and patients can be have better outcomes due to the increased attention. 

When they get out, they will get a discount with the prescriptions for going to CVS, and will generally enjoy the experience a great deal more. The hospital and CVS will communicate over getting the prescription filled immediately and you won’t have to wait in the store mindlessly reading magazines listening to a meth head trying to get whatever they bought in breaking bad. 

They just started selling CBD too, Millennials. 

Nurse practitioners are also way cheaper than a random doctor doing clinical rounds for random sick people at the emergency room. 

All the financial strengths can be found at seeking alpha. This is going to return value sub 55. ",Footsteps_10,1554302784,7,13,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b8yvrs/cvs_and_aetna_insight_on_the_business_moving/

"I pick options so you don't have to [Week beginning April 1, 2019]","**Disclaimer:** **You don't have to believe, agree with, or go with any of these picks.** These are the picks I'm watching this week and plan on potentially making plays into depending on if my dick is hard in the morning. Trade at your own risk. *When I use the term YOLO play,* ***it doesn't necessarily mean FD's,*** because some tickers are light on option chains. It just means put it in, and hold until you're +500% or more, or take the market in the ass in the short term. Out of the trades listed, the YOLOs *probably* have the most upside percentage gain potential, these are for the gamblers.

# Some Thoughts For This Week

Last week received pretty positive feedback, some people messaged me thanking me for finding them places to YOLO their money and others had various questions. Many people asked things like, ""What do I do now? I'm up XXX%"" or ""Am I still holding,"" etc. I figured I'd write out a quick message that is basically: Once you choose a play to make, you should already have an exit plan or whatever. It isn't my choice to tell you how much risk to take or how much profit you're aiming to make. Look at your positions, portfolio and either cash in tendies or YOLO it out, once you make a play it's all you. I can' t make you better at trading, but I can help give you some starting points on thought processes. I won't be responding to as many PM's this week in regards to questions like this because you should already have a plan for each trade regardless which way it goes.

# How The Picks Are Generated

These stocks are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. A few of the criteria:

* Market cap of $5B+
* Daily volume of 1M+
* $10 mark and higher
* Max PE of 25
* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on current market conditions/sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

# Results On Last Week's Picks

&amp;#x200B;

***Lennar (LEN) - BULLISH*** \- I think this play was listed first and played out how I thought. They ended up giving some back after earnings. It peaked $6 intraweek, and had some spots where there were a lot of places to make money. Hopefully you saw the reversal on Wednesday and got out Thursday beginning of day, or Wednesday at some point and scaled out -- once the yield curve stabilized the market didn't really care as much about the home builders even though numbers were up, production was down on KB Home, so it's a mixed bag. It's only a dollar above where it started last week. This is a perfect example of learning to trade and finding profitable spots to enter, and exit, like I talked about above.

**Apple (AAPL) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Opened the week at 190, closed the week at 190. If you BTFD at the 184 mark on Tuesday, you made money, otherwise, hopefully, again, you had exit points to get out of this shit because Tim Cook really bent us over on that event. Good announcements, underwhelming, people sold the news. Too bad.

**Royal Bank of Canada (RY) -** ***BEARISH*** \- Closed the week a few cents below where it opened but a mid week rally didn't help. I'm still bearish on this, so you can review last week's picks if you want. I wouldn't really be looking to trade it anymore as it's not reacting the same as other financials right now, but June Puts are still probably in the range of possible trades here.

**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Made an early week rally, and mid week rally off the lows. Looks like the whole market was making odd movements mid week, but I'm still bullish on this. It's back again this week, though.

**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH/BEARISH*** \- I said I wasn't bearish past last week, and I got this one right. Opened week at 360, closed at 381.23. I only see it continuing up so if you have the 5/17 spreads from last week - you're probably doing alright about now. The 4/12 $377.50 calls at $5.24 are now $10.55 and even have room to run for a couple days before the theta really starts to eat them up the next few days, so that's a one week 100% winner if anybody went with it. I know those are too expensive for many here, but it's a good example why paying premium is worth it sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I'd say last week I like the picks in general, still do, and we'll see what develops. But onto this week's stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Picks for Week of April 1st, 2019

&amp;#x200B;

**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \- I'm still bullish on Twitter. Stock's sitting at the support/resistance level again, if it climbs out of this area above 33 and change, I think it really has room to run. They report 4/23/19, I expect a beat. We'll see what happens though. That being said, holding anything up to earnings, you should see a bit of consolidation, it's heavily traded at the end of each day and has a very similar curve day to day, so I think it's being accumulated still. Consolidation is always good for price increasing.

* **Short term: 4/18 $34 calls @ $0.62**
   * Look to exit these before expiration unless they spike into the money by at least a dollar. Looking to hit early week momentum if the market really pops tomorrow like I think it may.
* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.71**
   * Same pick as last week, they're 5 cents per share cheaper. You get more time here to decide what to do. If you get the run you want, cash out the investment, freeride the rest, or let them all ride. Once again, your entries and exits aren't my choice. Early May exit still at least on a portion of the position.
* **Debit spread: 4/12 calls, Buy $33.5 @ $0.63, Sell $35.50 @ $0.17, $0.46 per spread.**
   * If you get a decent run by a dollar or two this week, you can easily double, or triple your money here. Cheap spread to get into, less exposure and easy and liquid to get out of if it starts to drop this week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gamestop (GME) -** ***BEARISH*** \- My outlook on this company is long term bearish. Now, they may surprise us with earnings this week but in the scheme of things, it really doesn't mean anything. Best Buy, Target, etc. are taking market share from these guys, and more importantly -- what we're seeing with them is a repeat of what happened to Hollywood Video/Blockbuster when they went up against Netflix. The web is the way. Game delivery aggregators like Steam and Origin are hand over fist exploding compared to Gamestop, and they keep closing stores like mad. Even if they go up, buy options with time to rebound down because if they don't go to 0, someone will acquire the assets, inventory and brand. To me, they're an acquisition target if only for their premium membership list and targeting potential for a bigger company. I don't think they can stop the landslide that is their company. When they report, this thing piles into the ground regardless of hit or miss on EPS it seems, because their guidance is continually shit. Unless something's happened with the new management, I don't expect much from them this week.

* **Short term: 4/12 $10 puts @ $0.42**
   * Spray and pray. Seems like even if they beat, you could be cashing in on these hard. I feel like looking at the long term trend of this, it's just a long drill into the core of the earth.
* **Longer term: 5/17 $10 puts @ $0.63 or $9 puts @ $0.29**
   * For like $21 a contract, or for $13 less a contract, you buy yourself another month out in expiration, and it seems even when this stock goes up, people profit take and it comes right back down.
* **YOLO: 4/5 $9 puts @ $0.14**
   * Obviously, these are a basic earnings FD. I mean, you know what to do. Hope the play is right and cash out when you sweat too much to stay in anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aurora Cannabis (ACB) -** ***BULLISH*** \- I'm bearish on almost every cannabis stock purely because of their ridiculous valuations. From the research I've done, although Aurora is also ridiculously valued, I take their market position, provincial position and more vs it's competitors. I think it's a bargain, and could easily trade at $20 in the next year. The fact is: One of these companies is going to really start pulling away, and with the upside left in this one, I'd rather go with a company that's more speculative than one that's trading between a $60 an $200 range in the last year. They report May 7th, so -- imo you can expect a run up until then. While earnings could be VERY risky, if you're not the risk averse type, you may be in store for a payout. If you are, just cash out and take the IV run up, but get into them now.

* **IV Play - 5/17 $10 calls @ $0.60 or 6/21 $10 calls @ $0.85**
   * Seems like easy money, honestly. I don't imagine them randomly dropping to $7/share and as IV increases, you can easily just sell off the Vega premium on these when earnings approaches. If you buy enough, and if they even flinch in the right direction before, you can freeroll a pretty big chance at big gains.
* **Long term - 9/30 debit spread $10-$13 call debit spread, Buy $10 call @ $1.28, Sell $13 @ $0.63**
   * At like $0.65 per spread, there's $3 in premium theoretical per spread, and September is plenty of time to see the move you need to capture it. This one I would consider a large position play, you need to throw a decent chunk at it in order to be invested enough and not feel like it's just sitting there staring back at you doing nothing. However, if it moves the wrong way, you should easily be able to recognize and set a stop loss and get out since earnings is the only catalyst event (probably two reports) between now and expiration.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH -*** I know, I know, I said last week financials are taking the big D. However, Tim Sloan's on his way out, and people like image change. Whether or not he was responsible for their shit is besides the point. Their image has changed. They trended up last week, money flow spiked up about 50% to $319M from below $200, and it looks like this could be a chance to rally and take advantage of people acquiring this stock.

* **Short term - 4/26 $28 calls @ $0.54**
   * These seem to be a bit cheaper than I would anticipate. I think if the market rallys, financials will gain back what they drilled off on the curve inversion selloff. Good chance to get easy gains. Get out of them before end of week if they aren't printing.
* **Long term - 6/21 $29 calls @ $0.62**
   * Pretty good price with 60 more days of theta burn for about $8 more per contract. Same thing. Make sure it's going your way, if not, burn them off. This stock will fluctuate up and down so if you're up, set yourself a decent draw down before you cash and run because it will consolidate more (up and down) before it really goes up, if it's going to.
* **YOLO - 4/5 $28.50 calls @ $0.04/$0.05 or $28 calls @ $0.14**
   * Personally, I don't know how much I'd throw at this one, but you can snatch a lotto ticket here possibly. Depending what happens premarket (hoping that it opens flat to last week's close) these could be a fucking bargain. For $100 you can snatch up maybe 15-20 of them depending, and they're only $0.90 share price from being ATM? Even at $0.15/$0.25 on the $28's, I'm a buyer here. You can watch it for a day and if it trends for Monday/Tuesday, it's easy 100%-200% gains, and you can probably cash out and freeroll.

# Stocks That Could Be Worth A Look

**Bullish:** Apple (AAPL), Adobe (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Ally Financial (ALLY), Amazon (AMZN, Alibaba (BABA), Altaba (AABA), Boeing (BA), Annheuser-Busch (BUD), CBS (CBS), Celgene (CELG), Dell (DELL), Dowdupont (DWDP), Teva Pharm (TEVA), Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), MGM Resorts (MGM), Credit Suisse (CS), Principal Financial (PFG)

**Bearish:** Tiffany (TIF), Accenture (ACN), Equifax (EFX), Booz Allen (BAH), Paychex (PAYX), Johnson Controls Intl (JCI), Discover Inc (DISCK), GoDaddy (GDDY), Array Biopharm (ARRY), People's United Financial (PBCT), Tencent Music (TME), Monster Beverage (MNST)

# State of the Market

Everybody's worried about a big pullback. I'm not, at the current moment. A recession will come with time, but I don't think it's this week and I think last week's action was purely profit taking by institutions and algorithms. They've found exits and gotten back out of positions many were stuck in for months, remember: Some people buy shares and not options. We saw mid day consolidation on a rise, and more profit taking at the end of the day. Timing it isn't possible, so don't try to. As far as the numbers are concerned, this is still a bull market, and although I like Gundlach, he feels so perma bear that I don't know we can take his words for face value. I think he's seriously short -- and bleeding trying to pull a Dr. Burry. We gained too far too fast on Thursday after fed announcements, and people saw a chance to cash out.

# Best Way To Play These Picks

At any given time if you have more than 3-4 tickers open for options and you're not a professional trader, you're probably not making correlated picks. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. Play a few of these positions, or just one, and find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, you'll see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding markets are a good way to double dip on plays.

# Want Me To Cover A Ticker?

If you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to do a quick analysis of it, if the underlying looks worth it. If it's not, I won't. If it is, I'll add a section below here that's WSB Picks and pick a few plays on it based on the same criteria the above. **If you ask for a ticker play, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $TSLA,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't do picks on all request, but I'll try to reply to thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, and so try to understand if I can't get to all of it. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week.

**Stocks I won't cover or comment on (because they're just too ridiculous):** Tesla, Micron

# WSB Requests

I don't follow these stocks nearly as much, if any, and this DD is even more surface level than the above. Just my thoughts on the requests.

Where are your calls on InfoSys ($INFY)?,"***FORUM NOTE -- Feel free to leave feedback/additions to this DD. I don't do it often, and I slapped this together quick for further discussion.***  


Let's talk about Indian-based InfoSys ($INFY). For those that don't know, InfoSys is *""a consulting, technology and outsourcing company, which provides end-to-end business solutions thereby enabling clients to enhance business performance.""*  


In other words, InfoSys's bread-and-butter is that the company gets your company the Indian customer service reps to be your customer service reps so your customers get annoyed that they have to repeat 5 times the same problem they had with your product before you can actually get some help. But InfoSys is expanding to become much more than that, and recent acquisitions or partnerships shows:  


1) [Purchased a 75% stake in ABN AMRO that deals in mortgage servicing.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/infosys-to-buy-abn-amros-mortgage-service-unit/articleshow/68623564.cms) Since Sept 2018, this is the third type of purchase its made, turning INFY into an aggressive stance than before.

2) [In early March, InfoSys locked in a ""long term, strategic partnership"" with Rolls Royce to provide them with engineering and IT professionals.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/infosys-to-deliver-digital-services-to-rolls-royce/articleshow/68305720.cms)

3) [InfoSys locked in a three-year strategic IT partnership with the French Open.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/infosys-announces-3-year-pact-with-roland-garros/articleshow/68516818.cms)  


Additionally, InfoSys seems to be making strides and investments in the AI sector as well. This makes sense given the natural transition away from human interaction with customer service to AI-generated support that is much less costly and can be more effective.

Since Dec 31, the stock is up 16%, but has essentially been trading sideways since Feb. 1 at around 10.50/10.75. P/E ratio is around 29, given their aggressive growth. But as you consider how InfoSys continues to be a dominate player in India industrial expertise to the rest of the developed world, they are seen as the leader in this arena.

INFY reports earnings on April 12, the same time JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and PNC do. And earnings are expected to be up at .13, but given their aggressive growth going forward, can easily see them beating estimates. Furthermore, if were to play calls on INFY, recommend $11 or $11.5 calls for April 18 expiry.   


*NOTE -- INFY has not broken through the $11 resistance mark, but this could be their time.*

"ATVI, WTW and K DD","ATVI is one of the few video game stocks that hasn't bounced back from its lows. 46% down from its 52 week high, 14.5% up from its 52 week low, with the recent announcement of COD for mobile this seems like a classic buy the dip opportunity. To top it off technicals are great, bullish divergences on Rate of Change and RSI and OBV has made a higher high. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kellog is one of the few food conglomerates still trading near its 52 week low. CAG had a great run (highlight of my last DD post, sold to soon, fuck me), GIS, MDLZ, CPB, all have rebounded from lows. K is 24% down from its 52 week high, 7.2% up from its 52 week low. What interests me most is the technicals, bullish divergences across daily and weekly charts for OBV, ROC, and RSI. In my experience OBV bullish divergences are a great sign for a bounce.

&amp;#x200B;

Also holding a WTW leap. Oprah is down $48 million, she has hundreds of millions of viewers, pretty sure she wants her $$$ back. WTW is still the #1 weight loss program worldwide and their acquisition of Nutrisystem only adds to their marketshare. Most of my faith in WTW comes from Oprah being an OG.

New Chinese Meme Stonk (basic DD inside),"I'm always looking for something to fill that gaping hole left by IQ, HUYA, BILI and all the other meme stonks that made my portfolio skyrocket last spring...

And this time, I'm gonna lock-in profits before it bottoms out after the pump and dump is over, goddammit. 

Ladyboys and Gentlemen, I present to you TIGR.

UP Fintech Holding Ltd is a brokerage service for Chinese folks to trade Chinese and US stonks. It's an app. And it's popular. Think Chinese Robinhood with a potential customer base roughly 10x what RH has. The stonk ticker is TIGR. 

From their site - 

We are the largest online broker focusing on global Chinese investors in terms of U.S. securities trading volume, with a market share of approximately 58.4% in 2017. 


From other sources - 

The rapidly growing company said that during the fourth quarter the turnover rate on its platform was 1,496 percent. The conversion rate and retention rate of customers were as high as 15 percent and 82 percent as of Dec. 31 and in 2018, respectively.

Its revenue nearly doubled year-over-year to $33.6 million in 2018, though the firm's net loss reached $44.3 million compared with a loss of $7.9 million for the prior year. 

Xiaomi has a 14.1 per cent stake in Up Fintech while Interactive Brokers Group, one of the largest electronic brokers in the United States, has a 9.5 per cent stake. The biggest shareholder is its founder, Wu Tianhua.

According to the prospectus, Up Fintech’s total trading volume reached US$119.2 billion in 2018 from US$16.3 billion in 2016 and US$63.3 billion in 2017.


From CNBC - 

I'm not gonna post shit from CNBC as per the mods, and because CNBC gives everyone diarrhea. 


So - 

It's losing money hand over first while expanding rapidly as hell. Sound familiar? A recipe for success and likely huge swings once options gambling becomes available. Low reporting requirements means lots of room to fudge their numbers. 

Mark yer calendars:

Quiet period ends 4/29/2019. 
Lockup period ends 9/16/2019. 

They IPO'd two weeks ago under the radar at $8 and have had a steady climb to $13 before dipping back to $12 today. Up 50% in two weeks, you say? Yessir, it's a good ole reliable Meme Stonk. High risk. Meet your new daddy Pappa Wu. 

And they have an English version of their site -

TL;DR: TIGR is the new meme stonk on the NasD. ",thefragileabsolute,1553822351,79,42,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b6r67s/new_chinese_meme_stonk_basic_dd_inside/

Let's talk about Canada,"  

The canary in the coal mine is Canada. They have been on an economic run for the last 10 years, both in their debt per capita and their infamous boom in housing prices (thank the Chinese). If you look at their household debt to GDP today and compare that to the US's in 2008 (subprime collapse), it's close to the same.

https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/embed/?s=unitedstahdtg&amp;v=201903190853a1&amp;d1=20060327&amp;d2=20190327&amp;title=false&amp;url2=/canada/households-debt-to-gdp&amp;h=300&amp;w=600

Here America reached 98% peak, while Canada has been at 100% debt of GDP for the last 2 years.

I've been watching Canada for a long time, and it's been very hard to short. They've been able to bounce back on any minor setback. Housing prices tumble 40% in Toronto, but their GDP and banks keep growing. Unemployment rate shoots up, but 50k jobs created next month. A quarter of negative GDP growth, but then reversed next quarter. Hence, no recession since 2008 while Canadians keep on taking on more debt.

But I think it's time.

Their banks are starting to put aside heavy loan loss provisions. Here, I put down the biggest banks in Canada and their loan loss provisions increase.

TD - 22.7%

RBC - 54%

BMO - (3%)

BNS - 26%

CIBC - 120%

I'll add more once I have time. I want to emphasis, that this COULD be it. COULD be. These things take a while to play out, and some financial panic might not happen until Q4 of this year. However, the odds are good for a short, since Canadians are hitting a ceiling on how debt they can take on. Therefore, more downward space than upward space.

Goldman Sachs on Apple Inc. ($AAPL),"TV service later than expected with no pricing and no bundle for now. Credit card incremental but small impact for Apple

Apple's Services reveal was materially different than we had anticipated. 

•The Apple TV+ service which we expected to be available now was only previewed for Fall availability with no pricing information. 

•An Apple Card credit card offer was announced for Summer availability with attractive spending tracking features but our calculations again imply little short term earnings impact for Apple. 

•Apple also previewed an Arcade gaming subscription service but again for Fall availability with no pricing information. 

•The News service announced was as we had expected and is the only Service announced that is available immediately. 

•Apple offered no Services bundle to compel users to sign up now though this is still a possibility for the actual launch this Fall. 

Though all of these services are interesting from a platform churn point of view none seem likely on our calculations to materially impact EPS in the short term, with the possible exception of Apple Arcade pending pricing and service details",WSBConsensus,1553700021,0,3,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b65lnk/goldman_sachs_on_apple_inc_aapl/
"$REV - Insider buying patterns, etc.","$REV is following a very familiar pattern at this point. The company sandbags their quarterly earnings, and then Perelman proceeds to purchase massive amounts of stock every day until the end of the quarter (i.e. at other times he is restricted from buying stock). This is the fourth quarter of this pattern occurring, and he seems to step up is buying at each round. This is a somewhat predictable pattern to folks who have been following this.

&amp;#x200B;

Since earnings came out, he as make purchases every day. For a total of 505,000. Another 35,000 stocks were purchased yesterday. He can continue to purchase today, tomorrow, and Friday. Odds are very high this buying will continue. Pull the Form 4s in Dec 2018 and Jun 2018 to observe these patterns yourself.

[https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=REVLON+INC&amp;match=&amp;filenum=&amp;State=&amp;Country=&amp;SIC=&amp;myowner=include&amp;action=getcompany](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=REVLON+INC&amp;match=&amp;filenum=&amp;State=&amp;Country=&amp;SIC=&amp;myowner=include&amp;action=getcompany) 

&amp;#x200B;

With typical volume of 75K a day, these purchases of 35K - 70K a day matter, especially given the low float, high short interest, and depressed prices from sandbagged earnings call.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

$REV has an ugly history and it is easy to get burned given the way earnings have been sandbagged, the unexpected extension of a standstill agreement back in the fall, and simply high volatility day to day on little or no news.

&amp;#x200B;

On March 6th through earnings, I closed out my positions in $REV given how they have handled earnings reports in the past, I was wary of them reporting a hue miss: [https://twitter.com/guanshotshots/status/1103363870545137666](https://twitter.com/guanshotshots/status/1103363870545137666)

That period saw the price decline from 25.5 to 17.3 on the earnings announcement.

&amp;#x200B;

I waited for the first Form 4 to be issued last week (at that point it was back to \~20 / share) - confirming that Perelman was back to buying and to gauge how aggressively - before piling in. He has been consistently buying, and even more aggressively than in the past.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b5qri7/significant\_insider\_trading\_activity\_last\_7\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b5qri7/significant_insider_trading_activity_last_7_days/) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For the remainder of this week - continued purchases of Perelman can be reasonably expected every day. There is a lot of upside to this, as it is the largest insider buying of any company. And the company has one of the smallest floats. I intend to hold my position through this week, and see how things develop into next week.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a standstill agreement. I think there is a misconception that this prevents an offer for a buy-out. All it does is require advanced notice and changes the process for a buy-out to make it more favorable to shareholders. I am not so arrogant as to predict the timing of the buy-out,  but he is up to 86.8% of shares at this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I posted on $REV previously. That post covers Perelman's buying pattern - owning about 87% of all shares - and a clear intent to make a buy-out offer, but with bad timing. And the post covers other issues around $REV. The timing was poor. And at this point, I have learned not to buy prior to earnings given that are consistently sandbagged, and also outside of buying periods (i.e. between earnings call and the end of the next quarter) price movement is often a total crap shoot.

"I pick options so you don't have to [Week beginning March 25, 2019]","**Disclaimer:** You don't have to believe or go with any of these picks. These are the picks I'm watching this week and plan on making plays into. Trade at your own risk. When I use the term YOLO play, it doesn't necessarily mean FD's, because some tickers are light on option chains. It just means put it in, and hold until you're +500% or more, or take the market in the ass and out of the trades listed, probably has the most upside percentage gain potential.

**First time note to mods:** I don't know to mark this as DD or Discussion, so I picked DD, since it kind of feels like it, but maybe not.

&amp;#x200B;

Fellow WSBers, I've decided to create more discussion across specific picks and hopefully offer a bit of insight into how to pick specific plays/create entries and exits, and help us all make a bit of cash. I give a variety of plays for each stock for you to research on your own further before torching your money. I mostly trade on market sentiment and momentum and the market isn't always logical. This is from my own list each week.

# How The Picks Are Generated

These stocks are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. A few of the criteria:

* Market cap of $5B+
* Daily volume of 1M+
* $10 mark and higher
* Max PE of 25
* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on current market conditions/sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Picks for Week of March 25th, 2019

&amp;#x200B;

***Lennar (LEN) - BULLISH*** \- With the housing data that just came out being so positive for existing homes, in the interim to their earnings on 3/27 before market, there's room for Lennar to run up even though they're a builder. You have a chance to capture IV gains, or hold through earnings if you have the balls. Interest rates having been low means people were likely building and buying all homes, in fact, I have three friends who I didn't even know could afford a house build, and my parents also, in the last six months. They build piles of houses in my area, in fact just started a new development with 100+ houses after finishing one with 125. They're a huge player, off their 52W highs by quite a bit, and with interest rates low, buying should be increasing.

* **Short term: 4/18 $50 calls @ $1.23**
   * Hold until before earnings, sell for IV gains on the 26th before market close.
* **Earnings: 4/18 $52.50 calls @ $0.60 or 5/17 $55 calls at $0.54**
   * Hold through earnings. Even if it goes against you, if you have the May calls, you have plenty of time to recover. If earnings are good, give the trade time to run and scale out slowly if you want.
* **YOLO: 4/18 $55 calls @ $0.28, hold and pray.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Apple (AAPL) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Apple's recently received an upgrade, and is $42 off it's 52 week high. There is way more upside than downside here. People that are buying in are buying in to hold through the service announcement and hopefully realize new all time highs. I think Apple's being accumulated, we saw a $7 price movement on Thursday, some people bought at the top, and are committed to this for term now. Their event Monday will hopefully bring a pop, followed by a fomo climb. Short term target for me is around $205-208. I currently hold $230 calls with about 90 DTE still, that I bought when Apple was at $170. They're up 600%, and I refuse to scale out. I think there's still a bunch of upside.

* **Short term: 4/18 $215 calls @ $0.39**
   * Ride through the event, gauge the movement, and take gains or hope for a swing up on more accumulation. We touched $197+ the morning of the selloff, and $196.33 the day before. If the week is green, this is over $200 by end of week.
* **Streaming Event: 3/29 $192.50 calls @ $2.88**
   * These were way more expensive before the sell off, and with the fact I see us rebounding from that, it (maybe) literally cannot go tits up. I don't imagine massive downside after the event, there's a reason they released all that hardware without announcements or a proper event for the hardware last week. They've got more going on then people think.
* **YOLO: 3/29 $200 calls @ $0.96**
   * The ultimate delight, run up required, and I'd advocate just selling off at 200% max after a pump before or after the event. If you have balls of steel, hold to expiration and hope the bull run for it continues. It only needs about 1.5% gains from last weeks high and I see it being accumulated more in the coming days, so it's definitely possible we see this type jump this week.
* **Long Swing: 6/21 $235 calls @ $0.50**
   * Probably not riding this one out until expiration, and I'd liquidate no later than May 5th-10th or so to avoid theta ramp. That being said, there's 1,000% upside here still easily, and you have more room/time to get out with minimal losses if it starts going against you after the event.

&amp;#x200B;

**Royal Bank of Canada (RY) -** ***BEARISH*** \- With the (hopefully) short term inversion of the yield curve, people are going to be very bearish on all financials. RBC was one of the smallest losers on Friday, and with more room down to 52W lows than space up to their high, and with the explosion of put volume in the big money market, I'd say that most funds are betting against it for good reason. It will take time for the US curve to affect a Canadian bank, but with the state of the global market, in the short term, this is going to lose ground speculatively. I wouldn't look for a long term play here. Play the market sentiment.

* **Short term: 4/18 $75 puts @ $0.75**
   * Let it drop, and decide when to take profits. Bounce out if it gaps above 78.50, it's going to likely be a loser no matter what then with the time until expiration.
* **ITM bearish credit spread: Buy ITM 4/18 $75 calls, Sell ITM 4/18 $70 calls @ $4.48 credit per contract**
   * Risk to reward is 9:1 here. Max profit is around $69.95 share price on 4/17 for $4,480 on a $520 risk. Basically, you're taking advantage of the extra premium and time value on ITM calls and praying for a big move down in the next month. Profit @ $71 share price is anywhere from 1800-3100 ramping up the closer to expiration you are. You'll be paying $52 a contract in collateral to open this spread. If you go with it - DO NOT LEG INTO IT. Open the position as a spread in whatever platform, and make sure you MAINTAIN YOUR LONG LEG. IF you get assigned early, your loss is capped at $52 a contract, but you can possibly liquidate those long legs and make more if it drops. You should not get assigned early here, simply giving information on how to play these. To reach max profit, you have to hold until expiration. Your breakeven at expiration is $74.49 on this exact trade at the numbers given. Anything below that will net you the exact amount below. Ex: $73.49 x 100 contracts = $1k.***WARNING:*** If your $75 long leg is out of the money near expiration and the short leg is ITM still, IE: share price anywhere between $70 and $75, **BE FUCKING SURE TO LIQUIDATE THURSDAY, OR FRIDAY MORNING BEFORE EXPIRATION.** There is **PIN RISK HERE. If you do not know what PIN RISK IS, DO NOT DO THIS TRADE.** Pin risk is basically getting pinned on a credit spread with no stop loss long leg as it expires, and then having the shares shift against your position once the short leg is assigned to you. This means your max loss has uncapped, and you can get fucked. You've been warned.
* **YOLO: 4/18 $70 puts @ $0.10**
   * If it tanks, you make bank. Simple.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Not a lot to be said here. Volumes up, people seem to be accumulating. Twitter's site usage is going to increase exponentially ramping to the presidential election and campaign trail. Call volume is up. I'd just make a directional bet based on momentum solely on those factors. 50% share price upside to the 52 high. If you know how, watch the RSI and if it gets above 71-72, look for an exit. If it gets accumulated too fast and your'e short term, people will profit take on this before more accumulating happens.

* **Short term: 4/18 $36 calls @ $0.44**
   * Look to exit these before expiration unless they spike into the money. I'd estimate at 150-250% gains. Pure momentum play/demand play.
* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.76**
   * You get more time here to decide what to do. If it ramps up hard to $38-$40 share price in the next 30 days, you can lock in a nice profit, cash some out and let some ride, or let them all ride longer. I'd be exiting this no later than May 10th if they don't look like they're making it to the strike.
* **YOLO: 3/29 $33.5 calls @ $0.60**
   * These are sitting around a .40 delta, .19 gamma, which is pretty good with a .06 theta. You only need about $0.15 of stock price gains per day to offset the theta. If it gaps way up, you've got a choice to make whether to watch it run or profit take. Anywhere from 50% to 1,000% is possible here depending what happens with the wider market.

# State of the Market

Everybody's worried about a big pullback. I'm not, at the current moment. A recession will come with time, but I don't think it's this week and I think last week's action was purely profit taking by institutions and algorithms. They've found exits and gotten back out of positions many were stuck in for months, remember: Some people buy shares and not options. We saw mid day consolidation on a rise, and more profit taking at the end of the day. Timing it isn't possible, so don't try to. As far as the numbers are concerned, this is still a bull market, and although I like Gundlach, he feels so perma bear that I don't know we can take his words for face value. I think he's seriously short -- and bleeding trying to pull a Dr. Burry. We gained too far too fast on Thursday after fed announcements, and people saw a chance to cash out.

# Best Way To Play These Picks

At any given time if you have more than 3-4 tickers open for options and you're not a professional trader, you're probably not making correlated picks. An example is playing Apple and SPY. If Apple gains, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards Apple. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying AAPL puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale. Play a few of these positions, or just one, and find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, you'll see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding markets are a good way to double dip on plays. Anyone who supplies Lennar's components for homes, is also probably good (Home Depot, Lowes, etc).

# Want Me To Cover A Ticker?

If you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to do a quick analysis of it, if the underlying looks worth it. If it's not, I'll just tell you it's not. If it is, I'll add a section below here that's WSB Picks and pick a few plays on it based on the same criteria the above.

Potentiometer Short play: Ford. Carbon Monoxide leaks in SUVs,"People have been complaining about getting sick in their Ford SUVs. Recent tests on driver shows signs of carbon monoxide poisoning. High levels of toxicity which is not good, it can actually be deadly. **THIS IS NOT NEW, THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING OM FOR 2 YEARS** Now there are new pushes most recently by Bloomberg. So first of all some recent news story on the issue: 

https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-ford-explorer-owners-say-suvs-making-them-sick/

Here’s an old link from 2017. Many cop patrols use Ford Explorer and its not so good when a cop is being exposed to carbon monoxide. Several officers were hospitalized. 

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ford-rushes-repair-police-suvs-more-departments-raise-carbon-monoxide-n791031

Unlike in a home basement leak of carbon monoxide, this is not *as* bad since you don’t sleep and live in your car. It’s still pretty bad because the long commutes can add up fast. Carbon monoxide is hard to detect without proper instrumentation. A person can not simply tell they are in the presence of it since it’s an odorless gas. There are debates on whether accidents have been directly caused in these SUV’s due to carbon monoxide poisoning however it’s very possible they were. CO can cause anything from dizziness to loss of consciousness to permanent brain damage depending on exposure. I’m not saying the issue on hand is that big but we don’t know. See below for more info on CO poisoning and symptoms. 

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642

Why Short Ford? This news will now start to develop more and more as the owners push for answers. Many owners are not going to want to drive their cars. Though the investigation is and has been underway it looks to be a boiling shitstorm. Ford will likely have to eventually admit to their fault which at the moment there is just an *alleged* monoxide leak because they even tried to fix the issue before but have failed to do so properly. If and when Ford makes the announcement. They will have to recall millions of explorers but that’s not the end of the world. Recalls happen. If the issue is just the whole near the lift gate that’s allowing CO then it’s a simply plug/patch up and you’re done, not s big deal. The worse will be the lawsuits that come along this type of a deal. There’s attorneys probably drafting up cases right now to get a class action suit going against Ford. 

Old individual lawsuit regarding same issue: https://jalopnik.com/police-officer-suffered-nerve-damage-after-carbon-monox-1819668340

Is Ford going to **TANK** on Monday? Likely not. Is this going to be their demise? Likely not. But it’s definitely a big issue that’s been brewing up too long now and somethings gotta blow with everything re-surfacing. 

TLDR: Ford SUVs had and still show signs of carbon monoxide leaks causing adverse health effects for drivers. Buy puts accordingly if you want. Buy calls to inverse wsb. Godspeed fellow autists.

DD: Uniti Group,"TLDR: Long Uniti Calls  $7.50 EXP 08/16/19 and some shares.

&amp;#x200B;

Long ago WSB used to be a place where you could find autistic ideas to lose money on. I long to return to those days and so here is my contribution to that end.

&amp;#x200B;

Uniti group is a REIT specializing in telecommunications infrastructure, primarily fiber lines.  Recently developments with their largest counter party have driven the stock price down hard. I believe going into 2020 a 50% return is relatively likely, or about a 30% decline.

&amp;#x200B;

In brief the story is this. Windstream, a telecommunications provider spun off Uniti years ago and then leased back those assets to actually provide the services they provide.  Some dudes bought up a bunch of Windstream's bonds, said that that spin off broke the debt covenants and thus Windstream was in default. They went to court, Windstream lost and declared bankruptcy (Chapter 11). These final steps played out over the last couple months.  

&amp;#x200B;

Windstream represents approximately 70% of Uniti's revenue and Uniti represents nearly all of Windstream's infrastructure. One company can not survive without the other currently. When Windstream lost the case and entered bankruptcy proceedings Uniti fell hard. Earlier this month Uniti's accountants basically said, ""if Windstream can't pay for their lease Uniti can't continue as a company for very long.""

&amp;#x200B;

Most people were probably in Uniti for the insane yield.  That is essentially guaranteed gone for this year. Expectations backed by filings indicate a little over a dollar of distributions this year .60 of which has already been paid in January.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why do I believe in the end this works out for Uniti?:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Lease: The lease is pretty strict on what options Windstream has in bankruptcy. They can accept the lease or reject it. This doesn't mean that Uniti can't allow renegotiation of the lease, and that may very well happen. However, they don't have to.  Rejecting the lease outright really isn't an option since Windstream then can not provide services.  As a carrier of last resort and with no other alternative rejection seems highly unlikely so realistically it's going to be accepted or renegotiated.  If it's renegotiated that could be bad for Uniti but acceptance will cause the stock to skyrocket.
2. No one really wants to see either of these companies fail. Even the debt holder suing Windstream obviously doesn't want them to fold.  The government, debt holders and leadership of the companies all are aligned on keeping these things running in one form or another.
3. Given Windstream's continued operations they have to use Uniti's infrastructure.  This gives Uniti a pretty good bargaining position.
4. All Uniti needs to do to return to $15 is maintain status quo and have Windstream's bankruptcy resolved.  Afterwards Windstream will be a stronger counter party and Uniti's cost of capital will likely decrease (a cost that is up substantially this month).

What might go wrong?:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Wed the 19th is the conference call for the earnings which were released yesterday (you should read those if you get into this trade.) The company is going to tell everyone they're cutting or suspending the dividend until the end of the year.  Anyone paying attention should already know this but that doesn't mean the market won't react.
2. If the lease with Windstream is renegotiated at a substantial cut it would dramatically decrease Uniti's ability to pay it's dividend.
3. If the bankruptcy drags on too long or uncertainty isn't cleared up this year Uniti's cost of capital will remain too high to do anything aside from muddle along waiting for things to change.  Their current plan is to diversify their revenue away from Windstream but that's not feasible with the current share price and the cost they must pay for credit currently.

So basically I'm long expecting perhaps a short spike (or plummet) later this week depending what they say on the conference call tomorrow and a longer term rise going into later this year.  You can play this via shares, short term with calls (or puts) hoping the conference call garners a favorable (or unfavorable) reaction or longer term with calls towards the end of the year.  I bought in the money calls for August as they seemed pretty cheap in comparison to other options but you do you.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll answer questions for awhile if anyone cares.

My DD on CBD - Long AMRS,"First off - a disclaimer: I don't smoke weed, never liked it much. I don't care about CBD myself, but I live in Colorado, and I see people putting that shit in EVERYTHING. Ice cream? CBD. Soda? CBD. Shampoo? CBD. Dog treats? CBD. Massage oil? CBD. Supplements that will cure every illness and make you a pro trader? CBD.

&amp;#x200B;

Now CBD is expensive. It's a molecule that is found in small quantities in weed/hemp. So you need to grow a bunch of expensive plants, extract, purify, and you only get a little bit of CBD of questionable purity.

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, CBD is A FUCKING [TERPENE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene). And my boys (and girls) over at Amyris (AMRS) have spent over a billion dollars genetically programming yeast, so that when it ferments, instead of delicious brewski, it makes any terpene. They are the only company who can do it reliably, and have scaled 8 different molecules so far. So for them the production process is fairly simple - throw a bunch of cheap-ass sugar cane in a large tank, add some magic yeast and watch it shit out expensive chemicals at an incredible purity.

&amp;#x200B;

So, as recently as yesterday, they [got](http://investors.amyris.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amyris-finalizes-cannabinoid-development-licensing-and) a $300M R&amp;D contract to make their yeast shit out CBD (they will also get a % of sales when they actually ship product). By my estimates it will cost them about $50M. The first CBD products made with their yeast are to launch in early 2020. BOOM, SHAKALAKA.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Amyris also makes a bunch of other useful stuff. Best skin moisturizer ever, squalane. Best zero-calorie sweetener ever, Reb M. They have the fastest growing skincare brand in the US. They are launching infant formula, gross as that is, and baby skincare to dethrone the JNJ fuckups who put fucking ASBESTOS on babies and yet own the baby skin care market.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with Amyris, is that their balance sheet is GARBAGE. It took them a long time to get to where they are and they have $200M in debt. Some of it they will pay by BIG POPPA DSM buying their Vitamin E business next month. But I expect that they will have to issue some shares too. That's where CBD comes in.

&amp;#x200B;

When CBD bros discover that there is a company in the sector, which isn't a  bunch of dirty hippies listed in Canada, but an actual MOTHERFUCKING technology company they will shit their pants, buy AMRS, and the company can address their debt with little dilution.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons for WTB to be in AMRS:

&amp;#x200B;

* Quality memes. Yelling YEAST MODE when the stock goes up is legit fun.
* CBD, dude, like yeah.
* It's the Apple of biology.
* It will fuck you in the ass whether you are long or short.
* Bill Gates owns shares, John Doerr is on the fucking board and is one of the largest shareholders, other big dick people in it whom I can't disclose.

Numbers for the old schoolers who are into that stupid shit:

&amp;#x200B;

2018 Rev $80M

2019 Rev expected $150M

Market cap $296M (though if you dillute it to what I expect it to be diluted to, it's more like $480M)

2018 loss $120M

What’s your move with FDX?,"FedEx (FDX) delivers packages and freight a a global network of customers. The company’s main business segments include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx freight, and FedEx services. FedEx Express makes up 57.4% of revenue, but only 45.2% of operating income. This segment credits itself as the largest express transportation company in the world, reaching over 220 countries and territories. FedEx Ground is responsible for 29.2% of top line, which converts to 45.7% of operating income. This segment delivers to US and Canadian businesses, and can reach 100% of continental US residents. FedEx freight earns 10.8% of revenue, and includes freight services of any length. FedEx services controls 2.6% of revenue, and includes various business services to support the company’s transportation services. The business currently trades at a price to earnings ratio of 10.4x, representing a 29.12% discount to the company’s 1 year average multiple of 14.8x. The main reasons for the selloff is slower integration with the TNT Express acquisition, slowdowns in global economies, and competition from Amazon, which as explained below, is completely overblown. 

FDX acquired TNT Express, an air and delivery services company, providing FDX with exposure to a deep European and Asian network. In FY’17, FDX announced a profit improvement goal of TNT of $1.2B to $1.5B between 2017 and 2020. In the company’s 2Q’19 earnings release, management noted this goal would not be reached, but still provided positive news regarding the integration process. At the time of the 2Q’19 call, 70% of the global sales force had been integrated, and the freight products and specialty services segments are growing rapidly. One reason for failing to miss the profit improvement target is a cyber attack the company faced in 2017. The Petya attack cost FDX $300mm in earnings, but since this attack was a one-time event that was not a result of weak business, I don’t think it deserves to damage the market value of FDX. Another reason for investor worries around this integration are high integration program expenses of $1.5B through 2020, which will include $450mm in FY’19. FDX is utilizing productivity-enhancing tools (bots, analytics, AI, etc.) to reduce the number of staff positions needed between the FDX and TNT. These high integration costs will likely be the last FDX has to pay, and they might decrease depending on the amount of positions cut. Finally, the global growth slowdown is a likely reason for the lower confidence in the business, which is explained more below. 

    Another reason for the extremely discounted P/E multiple is from concerns around the recent global economic slowdown. There is no denying the economic uncertainty economies around the world have been facing. Brexit has created economic uncertainty in the UK, Eurozone growth slowed from 2.5% in 2017 to under 2% in 1H’18, emerging Asian growth has slowed from 6% in 2017 to 5.6% in 2Q’18, world trade grew 3.5% in 2Q’18, compared with 5.3% growth in the same period a year earlier. Italy and Germany are dealing with slowing GDP, and the entire global economy has dealt with the trade tensions between the US and China. International revenue makes up ~33.4% of revenue, so does FXD deserve to trade at a lower multiple? Sure. But does this justify a nearly 30% discount? I don’t think so. The segment most exposed to international revenue is the FedEx Express segment, which is made up of 56.4% international revenue. Even with the global political slowdown, this segment’s revenue grew 5.8% in 2Q’18 compared to the same period a year earlier. This segment has also grown at a 1.4% compounded quarterly growth rate, showing there is still financial strength amid slowing demand. Investors also overlooked the other three segments, which have seen tremendous strength from a strong US economy, and make up over half of the company’s revenue. This growth was fueled from a 4.9% increase in General Rate Increases (GRI) for the Ground and Express segments, and a 5.9% GRI increase in the company's Freight segment. Overall I think the global economic slowdown justifies a declining P/E multiple, but not a decline as large as what FDX experienced. 

    Another reason for the discounted multiple is competition from Amazon, who has expressed interest to enter the logistics business. AMZN announced a 50 plane expansion to its Amazon Air fleet, and a $1.5B operating hub scheduled to open in Kentucky in 2021 with capacity for 100 planes. The company already handles 26% of its shipment centers and 185 fulfillment centers, and some analysts think its recent growth plans will cut into FDX’s market share. I think it is a ridiculous claim to compare AMZN as a legitimate competitor to FDX, and does not warrant a declined multiple. FDX recently stated AMZN accounted for less than 1.3% of calendar 2018 revenue, and is not a significant threat. Additionally, FDX’s history is made up of a series of purchases and acquisitions to build one of the most intricate global networks. If anyone thinks AMZN becomes a serious competitor when why buy a few planes and open 1 operating hub, they’re simply crazy. AMZN will not be a significant competitor in the short run, and any uncertainty around this news is completely overblown. 

    FDX is also implementing multiple initiatives to insure its multiple trades back to fair value. FDX announced FedEx Extra Hours, a service that delivers products after regular operating hours for next day delivery and local two day deliveries. Customers already include  AutoZone and Best Buy, with plans to expand to more retailers. The company is growing FedEx OnSite, a service that allows customers and FDX associates to pick up and drop off packages through a retail outlet. This service is available at over 12,000 retail locations, including 8,900 Walgreens stores, helping the company utilize the growing e-commerce market to attract customers. I am also confident FDX’s large market share, increasing efficiency measures, expanding operations, and strong financial history will help it retain its customer base and growing sales. 

    For 3Q’18, analysts are expecting adjusted EPS of $3.14, representing a (15.6%) YoY decline. This value has been revised downward by (1.64%) in the last four weeks. Revenue is expected to come in a $17.7B, accounting for a 6.9% (nice) YoY increase. My overall consensus is that FDX’s multiple was unfairly sold off in 2018, and I would buy calls long term. For earnings after the bell on Tuesday (3/16), this is a literal bet. I think investors will focus on management guidance for the integration with TNT Express, and see how financials have been impacted from the global slowdown. Since the stock is trading at such a discount, I don’t think investors are looking for much, but weak guidance could still have severe impacts. I’m probably going with calls, or I might wait until after earnings to buy calls. Let me know what you guys are thinking. 

TDLR: I probably won’t play earnings, but will consider calls depending on the management call.

According to Zacks. Analysts have anticipation on stock’s EPS of $0.53. That’s up 783.33 % from last year’s $0.06 EPS. If EPS of $0.53 is announced the profit of ACIU could hit $35.70M giving it 2.19 P/E. After $-0.19 EPS

In December of 2018 $LLY, (Eli and Lilly Co.) Agreed to partner with IC Immune to work to develop the tau aggregation inhibitor, focusing primarily on AC Immune’s ACI-3024 to treat Alzheimer's disease.  “Lilly also agreed to pay AC Immune CHF 60 million ($60.3 million) tied to achieving near-term development milestones, as well as up to approximately CHF 1.7 billion ($1.7 billion) in payments tied to achieving development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, plus tiered royalty payments in the low double digits.”

I trust the big names in the industry, you should to. LLY, if you were not already aware, is forefront in the manufacturing neuroscience products, they already manufacture and sell Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Strattera, Prozac and Amyvid, which all deal with neurological disorders.

I am confident that LLY would not have signed a multi million dollar deal with IC Immune if they were not sure that there was a bright future for their Alzheimer's product.

“This landmark partnership with Lilly is transformational for the future of AC Immune,” AC Immune CEO Andrea Pfeifer, Ph.D., declared in a statement. “Lilly’s substantial experience in neurology, and particularly in Alzheimer’s disease, is a major validation of our small molecule platform for CNS therapeutics. It also demonstrates the potential of our preclinical assets and adds substantial value to our pipeline. We look forward to working closely with Lilly in this exciting field over the coming years.”

Lastly, for all the skeptics out there that like to point out that the stock chart looks something like a series of plateaus. The reason for this is the discontinuation of AC Immune's collaboration with partner Roche Holdings. AC Immune announced early 2019 that it was discontinuing the CREAD 1 and CREAD 2 studies. These phase 3 trials were testing AC Immune's drug crenezumab. This bad news sparked negative headlines that caused a drastic sell off over one drug, a small portion of AC immunes pipeline.

Below I posted IC Immunes Pipeline to let you guys decide if the discontinuation of one drug justified a 60% price decrease.

SPY Day Trade mini-DD,"So for you Spergs that have the AM to trade I want to just share a quite obviously day trading strategy that requires real time quotes, an understanding of intraday levels, &amp; balls of steel (unless you're a stop loss tard).

Look at SPY chart on the daily. Instead of gambling &amp; holding SPY calls overnight (which I still do sometimes when I predict daily/weekly/monthly moves) I've found it can be just as rewarding -again if you have the time, real-time quotes, &amp; an inclination for yolo- to day trade SPY. The logic is that SPY has been inversing itself in the first hour or so of trading recently which can bring huge gains on options about to expire. Basically you buy slightly OTM options (&lt;$1) w/ expiry either the next day or the day you're trading at the low, and sell high.

Yeah. Obviously this is risky AF as theta seriously works against you and if SPY doesn't rise or fall fast enough you're screwed, not to mention if it goes the wrong way. A stop loss isn't a bad idea but gaps will hurt as well as the fact that you dont want to sell down 20% only to have it go up 100% (which happens all the time).

An example is today (or all last week...) SPY challenged 282.50 for the second time at approx 11am (bit later than usual) and I had my market order of 200 shares (fidelity's limit) ready to go on 282p. I wound up not executing because I wasn't positive of action, last monday we mooned and wasn't sure how today/this week would trade, if we would be held back by fed on weds, along with BA &amp; FB selloff (obviously we were and there's a reason why I'm on r/wsb). I wasn't about to lose 6k trading SPY on a Monday without real conviction (aka market feels).

1-800-PetMed-Express ($PETS) DD,"Eight months ago I posted some flakey DD to buy pre-earnings puts on $PETS (based primarily on the fact that they were overvalued at the time and their website is ugly), which panned out pretty well for those who participated: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/90gwsa/puts\_on\_pets/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/90gwsa/puts_on_pets/)

After that earnings report, and the 50% drop since then, I actually started digging in to the company and went long shares based on the following:

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

* $93mil cash on hand (\~$4.50 per share, or more than 20% of market cap)
* Zero debt (current ratio &gt; 5)
* P/E Ratio of 10
* Dividend of &gt;5% (and growing), less than 50% of cashflow
* Steady revenue and earnings growth
* Investors have been increasingly putting pressure on the company to return some of that cash to shareholders
* People love their pets, and they tend to do whatever they can to continue buying their medication

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

* CEO is a bit of a slouch, comes across as having a poor attitude and hardly answers questions
* Advertising and customer acquisition spend has been steadily increasing
* Repurchase orders have been mostly flat

Short Trex,"Trex is going to screw themselves this year.

I work in the industry and they just made a new decking type to try to compete with pressure treated decking. Which is about $1.20/ln ft. Their new board enhance basic is still $1.75/ln ft at the lowest possible price. That is still 46% more than pressure treated! On top of that they have a tropical line in the enhance which they call natural which retails for $2.50/ ln ft. This is quite a steep drop from their usual 3-5 dollar retail range.  This makes it less worth it for distributors and retailers to want to sell it because they make less per sale.

This is not even counting into the fact that their board that they created is scalloped on the bottom and the cap layer is thinner. There are a couple reasons why this is important. They have been touting for years how their board is solid and all boards that are not solid are teh suck. Also on top of that they were so proud of how thick their cap layer was these past few years as well. Now it is as thin as a sheet of paper. (Cost savings to make a board so cheap) It wouldn't be a problem had they came out with this as their first product but now these sales guys are going to have to double down  on what they said before to sell the product. I have already personally heard complains of the boards look and that they can't believe Trex would come out with such a piece of crap.

Also if you go to the store you can see the boards are already starting to warp just sitting in the Home Depot and Lowes stores. You can see that the board doesn't lay flat and the ends are off the ground. This is going to cause warranty issues for Trex. Also by scalloping the board like that and not putting the cap all the way around you are increase surface area for water to be absorbed into the board. This is going to again cause major warranty issues. 

I can see no benefit to Trex doing this. So either they scrap this whole plan after a couple months or they stick it all in and ride this thing out and have huge warranty problems in the next year or 2. 

Either way short trex is the correct thing to do.",joeyyungrocks,1552919471,42,21,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2jeam/short_trex/
CVRS push to continue?,[removed],ripthezong,1552913457,1,0,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2icp2/cvrs_push_to_continue/
Buy MIK Puts - Thank me Later,"Michaels (MIK) is an arts and crafts retailer in North America. In FY’18, the company generated 49.8% of sales from general and children’s crafts, 22.0% from seasonal and home decor, and 11.6% from papercrafting. 90.6% of top line was generated in the US, while 9.4% came from Canada. Although the company currently trades at a 5.28x price to earnings multiple, representing a 48.4% discount to it’s one year average, I am loading up on puts in anticipation for earnings being released before the bell on Tuesday (3/19). 

MIK began fighting against slowing sales and margins in 2018 with initiatives geared towards improving store layout and digital offerings. The company introduced flexible merchandising areas (FMA) to promote seasonal items. There are 700 stores with the FMA layout, up from 420 (lol) in FY’17, which includes 238 conversions in 2Q’18. FMA space was used to sell back-to-school, halloween, and holiday products in 3Q’18, and management plans to use it to boost kids creative gift sales in 2019. These FMA stores are reflected in MIK’s same store sales, which grew 3.8% in 3Q’18 after only growing 1% in the same quarter a year ago. It is important to note that unlike other retailers (TGT, WMT, KSS), MIK’s share price does not historically trade in line with same store sales figures. After MIK released 3Q’18 earnings, which included a 3.8% increase in SSS, the share price fell ~28.3% in the weeks following the report. 

With digital initiatives, the MIK is adopting a buy online, pick-up in store (BOPIS) model. The company expanded online selections by 35% in 3Q’18, and now offers over 100,000 items online. In terms of executing the BOPIS model, MIK doubled the amount of stores capable of fulfilling these orders to 450 stores. The company also brags about upgrades to its app, which has over 6.5mm downloads. I think an e-commerce push is essential for MIK to survive in today’s retail landscape, and is exactly what TGT, WMT, and others have done to succeed. But in MIK’s case, online sales make up such a small part of top line I don’t see these initiatives having much of an impact on earnings or investor’s opinions of the company. I couldn’t find any specific numbers, but management hinted at how insignificant this segment is to the business. 

MIK has continued change in 2019, when CEO Chuck Rubin “mutually agreed with the Board of Directors to transition out of his role as CEO.” A CEO just doesn’t leave a healthy company, so I’m guessing the Board of Directors isn’t satisfied with 4Q’18 results, and is not very confident about the future. This event caused JPM to downgrade their outlook from overweight to neutral. Two metrics that could have been responsible for the CEO’s departure, and I think will hinder the business moving forward, are gross margins and costs of goods sold. Gross margins have fallen 5.57% and 3.69% YoY in 2Q’18 and 3Q’18, respectively, largely due to higher COGS. COGS rose 1.46% and 5.6% YoY in 2Q’18 and 3Q’18, respectively, and if this trend continues without strong sales, MIK is in for a tough quarter. Analysts expect MIK to report 4Q’18 adjusted EPS of $1.43, which would be a 20.2% YoY increase, thorough in the past four weeks this consensus has fallen (0.17%). Revenue is expected to come in at $1.78B, representing a (5.8%) YoY decrease, and this estimate has fallen (0.05%) in the last four weeks. 

Overall, I don’t think 2018’s growth initiatives will be enough to support MIK this quarter. Although the stock trades at a crazy discount, I think there is still room for it to go lower.

Guardant Health ($GH) Long,"Currently deployed overseas and have had some time to really get into investing and do my own DD.  I must say this subreddit has helped with morale and tendies. I wanted to give back for the first time as a result of some of my big gains on GH. 

Long time lurker, first time poster. Go easy. TL/DR at the bottom.

**Overview:**

GH uses liquid biopsies. Which means they are able to get a lot of information from DNA in the blood that can give clues about what types of treatment are most likely to work for the patient. Additionally, the procedure is relatively simple and non-invasive compared to traditional biopsies. Their focus in the short-term seems to be around detecting Lung cancer, but will expand. Their stock has seen a large bump due to the positive results from their recent NILE Study ([Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/guardant-s-liquid-biopsy-trial-hits-primary-endpoint-for-lung-cancer/))

This is huge. The average cost of a lung biopsy was $3,784, with a mean cost of $14,634.  (Average cost of a lung biopsy with complications was $37,745, and adverse events were reported ion 19.3% of patients with biopsies ([Source](https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/care-delivery/cost-analysis-reveals-need-reduce-biopsy-use-diagnosis-lung-cancer)). Not only can a biopsy be painful, risky, and time consuming, but there also exspensive! GH tests cost about $6,800 and takes seven days,

**Recent Q4 Performance:**

\- Sales grew from $20mil to $32.9mil +64%

\- Net Income from -$15mil to -$25mil

\- EPS: -$0.07 to -$0.30

([Source](http://investors.guardanthealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/guardant-health-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2018))

**Next Steps:**

GH has invested heavily into LUNAR clinical studies. These results, if positive, will help detect early-stage cancer, recurrence of the disease and overcome challenges like biological noise mutations associated with aging and limited sensitivity of genomic-only tests where less tumor DNA to be found ([Source](https://www.biotecnika.org/2019/01/lunar-assay-for-early-cancer-detection-by-guardant-health/)). In addition, if their technology platform works (Guardant360) could capture a large market opportunity ($35bil) for cancer survivors who require periodic monitoring (Lunar-1), and individuals who  at higher risk of developing disease (Lunar-2). These results should be available sometime during the 2nd Half of 2019 and initial pilot data will be available some time next month. 

GH is expected to grow revenue over 130mil, 43%, in 2019, but net loss is expected to increase to $130m. Pretty scary, but they have the cash, $500mil. ([Source](http://investors.guardanthealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/guardant-health-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2018))

**Tl/DR:** GH has surged recently do to their favorable results utilizing liquid biopsies. I expect GH to continue to rise when they unveil the final results of the LUNAR assay sometime mid 2019 and their initial findings next month.

There are two scenarios, one with purple arrows and one with yellow. Both have the same destination. This looks like a classic bullish pennant set up to me.

**In Scenario 1** (purple arrow), it should get to 190 in this bull market by next week, imo. In this case, I'm looking at 3/22, 190calls, at 0/05 (right now). I might buy 100x of these for $500. If it touches 190 next week, this should be about an 8k+ profit. **This is some seriously stupid gambling. Probably should buy longer dated.** 3/22 190c for 0.22 looks pretty good to me.

**In Scenario 2** (yellow arrow), MCD dips back down to 181ish, where there is some support (see green line dividing the triangle). Either start scaling into calls soon, for 4/5 190c for 0.54ish, or 4/5 192.5c for 0.23ish. I'll have to think about sizing here. Tempted to buy 100x 4/5 192.5c, for $2.3k investment. If this is ITM by next Friday, this is 20k profit. If it's ITM by 3/29, this should be 8k+ profit.

The market is in full bull mode, and if this is a pennant set up, then we are looking at some serious happy meal tendies here.

By my understanding, MCD needs to close above 184 today, for scenario 1 to have shot.

$EMIS major tendies - next gen type 2 diabetes treatment,"Emisphere technologies, your next big yolo long only play that gives you the same feeling as your precious FDs, except you'll be bagholding this one till your grandchildren have children.

This bad boy is partnered with Novo-Nordisk and provides Novo the next gen type two diabetes ORAL treatment aka oral GLP-1 to bring down your sugar levels aka treat diabetes rather than have a needle stuck in your arm.

So what the hell is GLP-1 (pronounced jilp if you want to sound smart like all the scientists)? It's the next gen diabetes treatment that not only brings down your sugar levels to healthy levels, it also has this nasty side effect of helping you lose weight as well. Novo has been leading the jilp game.. so what does this have to do with our savior EMIS?

Jilp treatments have always been injectable but Emisphere discovered a way to take the jilp treatments and condense them into an oral tablet. They now have partnered with Novo with a ROYALTY BASED AGREEMENT for their oral glp-1 drug that is currently in Phase 3 and Novo just filed for accelerated approval of the oral jilp. Now this is huge because they'll be the first to have type 2 diabetes treatment that is taken in an oral form. Who would rather take a needle then just pop a tablet into your mouth?

Emisphere is just sitting there waiting for the drug to be approved and then they'll be racking in millions in royalty fees. Get in here before it's too late. You heard it here first.

tl;dr emisphere partnered to sell an oral treatment for type two diabetes and once the drug is approved it's going to make bank. get in before it's too late",exiarais,1552581163,57,61,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b12ful/emis_major_tendies_next_gen_type_2_diabetes/

Can we talk about YETI?,"Lots of buzz about this stock, but the hype honestly seems crazy irrational.  


A few posts have mentioned the fact that the short interest is very high on this stock...

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/avrbn4/very\_high\_yeti\_short\_interest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/avrbn4/very_high_yeti_short_interest/)

...yet it keeps climbing.  


I'd like to call attention to the fact that of the 84M shares outstanding:

* About 42M are owned by  Cortec Group Fund V, L.P. and are not for trade.
* 16M shares are owned by the founding brothers
* 8M are locked behind employee stock programs ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000110465918063819/0001104659-18-063819-index.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000110465918063819/0001104659-18-063819-index.htm))

  
So that leaves us with 18M shares left, and public info shows that there's a float of 15M, so it's in line. So if you're a Chad that wants a piece of the YETI action, you're competing with every other overlanding-bros for a piece of that 15M float pie. (Meanwhile the short interest on the float is now 68%).  


So my take on it is that Cortec and the brothers will hold onto their controlling power of the company, 8M shares that are currently locked behind employee incentive contracts (just think, there's employee based locked in compensation equal to 50% of the float right now!!!!) will be released to the masses and that supply will drive the price down.

Meanwhile lets look at financials:

&amp;#x200B;

* This turd is trading at 38x P/E.
   * A little context, AAPL is trading at 15x.
* In their filing ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000104746918006818/a2236927zs-1a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000104746918006818/a2236927zs-1a.htm)) they funded an increase in cash with a reduction in inventory, which is good. Inventory control is doing well. But there hasn't been any substantial change to their asset base in the same time. Net sideways.
* Their liabilities were decreased funded by a reduction in shareholder equity. Net sideways.

$BA issues 737 MAX software enhancement press release - offers condolences to families of both crashes. A little sleuthy DD inside.,"[Press Release](https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130402)

Only a few hours ago the FAA and $BA both said these jets are deemed ""airworthy"" and there's nothing to fear. Both also stated that it's too early come to any conclusions. Oddly enough though, they've been working closely together to patch the MCAS software for months. This is the software many believe led to the Lion Air crash last year.

I've seen the arguments from the bulls here about the smoke and sputtering noises before the crash, leading some to believe that this is an isolated incident. The eerie similarity is in how the Ethiopian flight just decided to nose dive directly into the ground after [experiencing unstable vertical speed after takeoff](https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/1104671024581357568).  It's not crazy to think some kind of mechanical failure happened, the pilots attempted to compensate, and this piece of software decided it knew best and sent the jet crashing towards earth.

You'd have to be both retarded and blind not to recognize that both of these organizations understood the dangers of these jets, and continued to let them fly. 2 out of the (350) 737 MAX 8's in commercial use have violently nose dived mere minutes after take off. Killing every passenger and crew member in both instances. ROUGHLY .6% OF THESE FUCKING DEATH TRAPS HAVE EXPLODED WITH LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF USE UNDER THEIR BELT. That is insane.

&amp;#x200B;

So what's my point here? *Culpability.*  Both the FAA and $BA have stated that these planes are just fine, yet they're actively working to solve the safety issues. They've got nearly 400 fatalities on their hand at this point, have essentially admitted guilt with their condolences and software development, yet rather than admitting they fucked up the first time around, they're doubling down.

To make matters worse, take a look at the [insider trading records from the last few months](https://i.imgur.com/7OXK6B6.png). I suppose an argument could be made that these execs were just cashing in on historically high prices. What's really fucking odd though is the EVP and General Counsel to $BA gifted half of his shares to an undisclosed party, and the other half of his shares to his wife, who then transferred to a trust on October 29th 2018. Yes, that's the [date of the first 737 MAX 8 crash](https://i.imgur.com/yNaTwXK.png). What a coincidence. Then, a few weeks after the black box was dug out of the ocean, [he and his wife sell 8,500 shares, or 69% of their disclosed shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000122520819002329/xslF345X03/doc4.xml), on the open market. [It's worth noting that officials claimed it could take a few weeks to recover the data.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-crash/no-public-details-on-crashed-lion-air-voice-recorder-until-final-report-indonesian-official-idUSKCN1PG08R)

This is just one example. Go look up the other execs. Equally suspect shit going on with quite a few of the officers.

&amp;#x200B;

Who cares though, right? You should if you hold a bullish position on this stock. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore, head of the House Transportation Committee, stated that  [""heads will roll at the FAA if they're not confident in their data and the safety of this plane""](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/feinstein-blumenthal-lead-dem-pressure-on-boeing-after-deadly-ethiopian-airlines-crash).  

If that happens, let's be real here, heads are gonna to roll at GM as well. Once the investigations start, shit is gonna hit the fan. Remember what happened to Ford with the whole [exploding pinto scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto#Legal_cases)? Around 1979  the corporation was *charged with murder,* paid a disclosed $128M ($450M today), and who knows how much they settled for out of court. Oh, and more importantly for you bulls, their [stock price plummeted by 66%](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/F/ford-motor/stock-price-history) and didn't recover for 3 years.

How to trade with money you can AFFORD to lose,"We've almost all been there, you find what you think is a good trade, or you think if only you could add more to a position, then you will grow your account that much faster. Suddenly you may find yourself wondering how you can get more cash, and quick!

&amp;#x200B;

It's important to realize how this mindset can quickly become detrimental to your trading account, to your private life, to your emotional well being, and to your financial well being. 

&amp;#x200B;

What am I talking about when I use the title of - Trading with money you can AFFORD to lose?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm referring to funds that are not needed to be used to do any of the following...

\- Pay Rent/Mortgage 

\- Purchase Food

\- Pay Bills/Utilities

\- Reduce Debt

&amp;#x200B;

When you have a roof over your head, food on the table, clothes on your back, and zero debt, it's important to reflect and realize just how valuable of a situation that is.

If you come from an environment where one or more of those variables were not available to you at one time, and now are, you likely already understand what it's like to come from not having those things, to now having them. 

Each one of those variables effects you in your everyday life, and even subconsciously whether you choose to recognize the effects or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we're trading emotionally, which is already advised against, keeping the variables I mention above in mind, does not always continue to happen, and we risk taking those things for granted when we let our emotions take control of our logical thinking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly you may find yourself trying to think of alternative ways to acquire additional funds that you don't have to work and wait for. 

Not limited to, but including the possible methods...

\- Cash advances

\- Small personal loans

\- Borrowing from Friends / Family

\- Use of emergency funds

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you will be the 1 in 100 story of how you maxed out your cash advance allowances available to you, used your credit to get a personal loan, tapped into family or friends funds and miraculously came out with huge gains and were able to pay it all back. 

&amp;#x200B;

But what happens to the other 99 stories where it didn't happen that way?

What happens when you've used even 1 of those mediums to their max, and unfortunately managed to lose it all, and now have to deal with the consequences. 

&amp;#x200B;

Typically this is the point where hindsight becomes 20/20.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are one of those 99 remaining stories, you've exposed yourself to a whole new world of downside that you weren't originally thinking about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe now you owe a bunch of money on a loan, with interest, that even if you work 40hrs a week, will take you months to years to pay off. 

Maybe now you are realizing how angry or betrayed your family or friend feels, because you told them it was a low risk trade that was likely to not fail and was almost guaranteed to have profitable returns. 

Maybe now you are realizing that you had never even thought about what would happen if the trade went sour, and you really can't even afford to make those loan payments, but are just now realizing that your credit score is on the line if you don't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Say you are one of those 99 stories, can you speak from experience? 

Was it worth it in the end? 

Was it worth the stress of trying to recoup the losses, the shame of disappointing a family member or friend? 

&amp;#x200B;

What if you had just spent even five minutes to not think with fear or greed, and just think logically ""should I really do this, are the risks worth the potential rewards?""

&amp;#x200B;

Because that's what it is, it's a risk you're considering accepting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just like the risk that you accepted when you took the trade in the first place, that may have led you to this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have you really thought about the cost of that risk. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can you AFFORD that risk? 

And if you can afford that risk, does that mean you SHOULD buy into it? 

Not necessarily. 

&amp;#x200B;

KNOW that there are fresh opportunities to profit every single day. 

There is always something moving, crypto, stocks, forex, options, etc. 

There is ALWAYS opportunity. 

24/7/365

&amp;#x200B;

So why would you put your entire life or even parts of your life on the line for one opportunity, on any one specific day, that even has the smallest chance of not paying off?

&amp;#x200B;

Even if the opportunity has the appearance of being %99 successful, are those elements of your life worth risking for ANY percentage? 

&amp;#x200B;

Really ask yourself that question, and think about the ramifications of what it would be like to lose things that you may be taking for granted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe your lottery ticket is the winner, maybe the opportunity you found paid off. 

Maybe it doesn't. 

Maybe tomorrow you wake up with debt up to your neck, and now you're struggling to tread water. 

&amp;#x200B;

How does it feel to have to tread that water, now knowing you will drown if you don't keep your head in the air?

DD Has Arrived!!,"I always keep my word boys!

The play we have here today is a long call in BUDU. Now if you’re not familiar with the company, I’ll give a brief rundown.

Baidu is the largest search engine platform in China. It is the most visited website in China and has something like 70-80% of market share, with only two smaller competitors. It’s American counterpart would have to be Google, the main difference being it doesn’t face nearly as much competition. 

Like Google or any other search engine, Baidu derives most of its revenue through selling online ad space on its webpages. It also has a variety of transaction based services and continues to develop its own AI and cloud computing systems. 

But that’s not the best part: Baidu also owns 70% of IQ! Anyone else remember this meme stock?! I sure as fuck do cause I bought at IPO. All joking aside though, IQs stock price has been doing well recently and believe it or not, the company actually has a real business plan and is executing on that effectively.

Now you may or may not be aware that the Macro situation in China is improving, and that the China ETFs have broken above prior resistance, actually outperforming the US so far this year. (FXI, CQQQ) I’m very bullish on China, and follow their market just as closely as America. That’s how I know all this shit to begin with. 

What’s interesting though, is that BIDU has been left behind so far in the larger China rally. This is mainly because it faces some short term headwinds related to CapEx spending and margin pressures. So although revenues are growing, so too are costs of sales. This trend is expected to ease following 2019 though, as spending is reigned in and a more robust Chinese economy drives more aggressive online advertising. 

Long term the growth runway is huge, with unmatched market share and a China that continues to see internet and mobile device penetration. The fundamentals are excellent too, with a P/E of 14 and $45 in cash per share. I believe the market is significantly discounting Baidu’s long term value in the face of depressed EPS growth this year, and following a large basing period BIDU will finally experience some much deserved gains.

I own shares as well as a $165 call dated Jun 21. I’m up on it 50% already and only bought on Friday. I highly recommend everyone here consider adding a long call when the time looks right, as well as adding shares if that’s your thing. Good luck!!",New_Age_Caesar,1551895795,0,7,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ay1vsn/dd_has_arrived/
ULTA Earnings Report,"Just wrote a DD for my newsletter. ULTA tracks its EPS well (see attached image). We are trading long. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the excerpt containing the trades:

  

Here is my options recommendations:

If you want to hold through ULTA’s mini-bull season, which lasts until the end of June, our price target is $356. The following strategy looks good:

* Sell 2x Apr18 $310 call - $1751x2 = 3502 credit
* Buy 3x Jun21 $340 call - $1316x3 = 3948 debit
* Buy 3x Jun21 $300 put - $1678x2 = $3356 debit
* Sell 3x Jun21 $305 put - $1830x2 = $3660 credit

Total cost: -$10

I have worked out the options so that we open this for free (or at a $10 credit, technically). The first two options are actually good enough, only costing about $500 for the play. That’s not including margin, by the way.

The profit potential is unlimited, but you have too potential loss areas: between $315 and $340; below $305. You can modify the loss areas by changing the strike prices; I’ve merely listed what I believe to be reasonable strikes to make the trade free.

If you just want to play earnings with a simple long call, you have two good choices.

Cheaper, lower probability of profitability, but higher potential ROI:

Buy Apr18 $340 call

Costly, higher probability of profitability, but lower potential ROI:

Buy Apr18 $310 call",veriald,1551855345,51,28,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/axvxbz/ulta_earnings_report/

Dollar Tree (DLTR) Short Opportunity (Weak DD Inside),"After hearing some ramblings about DLTR recently, and with earnings coming next week, I decided to take a look.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, DLTR had enormous drops (10+%) after slightly missing earnings in Q1 and Q2.  Q3 they beat but did not see a huge jump in stock price.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on historical value, if they beat earnings next week, there will not be much of a price jump.  But if they miss, there will be a huge price reduction.

&amp;#x200B;

My idiot logic is telling me that if they miss earnings next week, we can see another 10%+ drop.  And to my untrained eye, put prices don't seem too outrageous, especially down in the $92-$90 range.

Thoughts on Portola Pharmaceuticals tomorrow,"Portola Pharmaceuticals (PTLA) has a huge day tomorrow. They are announcing the opinion of the European Medicines Agency / CHMP on the approval of their niche drug, andexanet alfa, which is the first and only antidote to reverse life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding events in anticoagulation patients. Andexanet has already been approved (5/18) by the FDA for use within the US via FDA Accelerated Approval pathway, with US Orphan Drug and FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations, and has been added to the 2019 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines. 

They have been actively meeting with the EMA/CHMP for European approval since filing a marketing authorization application in 2016. Portola has stated oral explanations from the EMA have been positive regarding andexanet, stating they would like additional data before final decision on Feb. 28, 2019. Feb. 7th, Portola officially announced the full results from ANNEXA-4, their phase 3b/4 trial for andexanet, at the International Stroke Conference 2019 and published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The results showed excellent or good hemostasis was achieved in 82 percent of patients. The full trial can be accessed via NEJM, or quickly found under the Investors, News Releases tab on Portola’s webpage. 

In addition to the seemingly promising pending approval decision releasing tomorrow, they are announcing fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results tomorrow pre-market as well, which are expected to beat predictions. 

Obviously there’s always much more at play than what meets the eye at first glance, and I’m not an expert by any stretch, but I am personally very excited to see what tomorrow holds.

Cognizant Short Ripening?,"I know I shouldn't really be calling attention to this and giving out free tendies, but anyone else think [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/) is totally fucked?

&amp;#x200B;

**Who works at Cognizant?**

[The initial report from the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona) described traumatic working conditions for the ""foot soldiers"" of Cognizant performing Facebook content moderation.  If this doesn't scream ""toxic company culture"" I'm not sure what does. Meanwhile they also claim Innovative AI systems -- but don't mention droves of [underpaid and foreign human labor](https://www.statista.com/statistics/328322/cognizant-employee-numbers/) (""a workforce of more than 180,000 in India"").

&amp;#x200B;

**What is their ""Intelligent Approach to AI""?**

Just visit their website. They make BIG claims. So what is their ""Intelligent approach to AI"" they claim to have?

[Bigframe](https://www.cognizant.com/cognizant-digital-business/applied-ai-analytics/bigframe) \- They describe what sounds like a game-changing innovative AI solution. It's nothing more than a way to migrate large amounts of data and can't even be called AI.

[BigDecisions](https://www.cognizant.com/bigdecisions)  \- ""AI enables elegant human-like decisions for machines and hyper-personalized experiences"" -- looks like dog shit (just coming from an ML engineer at a FANG company).

[Buzzword Central](https://www.cognizant.com/cognizant-digital-business/applied-ai-analytics) \- Not to mention they're actually an ""IT services"" company, yet claim to specialize in AI solutions (while out sourcing 90% of their labor to India?)

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention they had to fire 200 Senior Execs because they ""were not able to catch up with the latest technologies""

&amp;#x200B;

**Controversies**

These indicators of unsustainable cheap labor and scandals add to a growing list of [controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognizant#Controversies). For instance their bribery in India scandal, where they [settled with the SEC for $25 Million](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cognizant-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-bribery-claims-11550252878).

&amp;#x200B;

This is the firm that Facebook trusted with monitoring misinformation and fighting the troubling spread of fake news which is believed to have been influential in the 2016 elections.

&amp;#x200B;

**Into the Ground?**

There's hardly any company-insider [ownership (0.27%)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CTSH/key-statistics?p=CTSH). This is considerably low for publicly traded companies (especially in S&amp;P500). Preparing to tank?

&amp;#x200B;

Though their numbers are good on paper, something smells terribly fishy, and they seem particularly vulnerable to increased media scrutiny.

&amp;#x200B;

A [recent AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/auwngd/im_a_facebook_content_moderator_i_deal_with/) from an employee (who quickly deleted his account) that works moderating Facebook content at Cognizant reveals what the company is: a stone-age IT company built on the backs of foreign workers. Not a sophisticated AI-driven company. The fact that it's on S&amp;P and 'good on paper' forces index funds to hold large shares, and is likely the only thing propping the stock up in the face of an unsustainable revenue model. Facebook seems to be intentionally burying the scandal -- maybe why it's not dominating the recent news cycle, despite the large interest in the recent surge of fake news and disturbing content on social media.

&amp;#x200B;

Just overall shocked this company looks completely off people's radar. Would appreciate some thoughts opinions?

Invest in KPTI (Karyopharm Therapeutics) looking for rebound to average,"KPTI dropped over 40% 2 days ago due to strong reports by the FDA that their most researched drug (selinexor) will not get phase 3 approval during the meeting on such topic tomorrow. 

This is a all-time low for the company and due to these drug-developement companies constantly operating at a loss, the stock (like TSLA) rides heavily on non-quantitiative metrics and general market feel towards the company and more importantly its research. 

This low point is a great time to invest as (like we saw with apple) the market impact of the FDA's decision was already felt 2 days ago with the 40% fall and there is a very limited further impact that tomorrows meeting could provide to drop the stock further.

With enough cash flow to ensure operations through to 2020, i would expect the stock to rebound anywhere from $7 - $9 over the next couple months as consumer attitudes ""regress to the mean"" and forget about this polarizing poor report.

I definitely do not believe in the companies product (as i believe there are far more revolutionary cancer treatments with better applicability) and think that it would be foolish to long KPTI however in this case, the stocks risk seems highly controlled with a limited possibility of future loss.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I am investing in u-blox?**  


I am an Engineer with an MSc in Computer Vision based localization (related later). Right now I work for a surveying company, working on cm grade mapping. These maps **are critical infrastructure** for the future of fully/semi-autonomous vehicles, which includes drones etc. Business is booming.

&amp;#x200B;

My graduate studies focused on Location Based Services for mobile devices.

&amp;#x200B;

U-Blox was introduced to me by one of my friends from grad school who works in the GNSS (Novatel), who do mostly software but also in house prototyping. He may or may not have intimate knowledge of transactions with the company. ;)

&amp;#x200B;

He also tells me that their products are 'top-shelf' for the same price as other competitors (e.g. STM, which i am also invested in)

&amp;#x200B;

What I can tell you for a fact (based on my education/experience) is that location based services are the present and future of tech. This includes anywhere from Autonomous cars/drones/robots to mobile games and professional services. For example, future AR or VR application will require cm grade localization (or at minimum 'tracking') that is not yet satisfied in terms of processing speed using the popular vision based methods we have today. Especially not on mobile phones.  


Any of you who've played todays VR/AR games can attest like me that they are underwhelming and/or, the more advanced ones, require a highly structured and constricted environment.

&amp;#x200B;

Also show me a 2019 vehicle that will not be equipped with some autonomous driving in one from or another. 

&amp;#x200B;

My bet on u-blox is based on my belief that this technology will accelerate in a shocking rate, and these new products will all require dual-band GNSS chips, which are very different than your shitty phone/car GPS that you might have currently.  


\- 

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that they are also involved in other communication tech such as bluetooth, and LTE/5G products for mobile devices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Monies$$$**

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017, the company made about 80% of its total revenue from 84 customers. u‑blox's largest customer accounted for less than 6% of revenue.  They also tout a very healthy 61% equity ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

This shows stability as a long term investment.

&amp;#x200B;

They are trading right now at a PE of \~10 and EPS \~$8, with strong revenue growth. I am betting on them producing revenue growth well over their estimates based on the above. They have also been investing significant cash flow in supply-chain, this will allow them to meet the demand predicted.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happened to their share-price in August 2018?**

&amp;#x200B;

They dropped from 200's to around $80, but what happened?  


Fucking Trump happened. They posted major growth from Asia in 2017, and the trade war spooked their shareholders. Things are looking more optimistic now, and although China's growth *is slowing*... it will not be slowing in the mobile/smart-tech and autonomous vehicle industries.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr... Buy U-Blox

WIX Revenue Forecast,"WIX is reporting earnings tomorrow BMO. You can estimate their paid memberships by looking at how many domain names are pointed at their name servers, because only paying users have a reason to do that. I have access to a tool that gives me a historical snapshot of this number, so I can see what it was at the beginning and end of the quarter. And using numbers from previous quarters I can figure out how much they earn on average per domain pointed at them.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this data, I estimate that their Q4 revenue will be $162.97 million, on the last call their guidance was $161-162 million so it passes the sanity check. They only grew their paid subscriber base by around 4.7% in Q4 which is down from the previous quarter. But so far in Q1 they are trending towards growing it by 6.1% probably due to their Super Bowl spot. Extrapolating out, I estimate their revenue guidance for Q1 will be at least $173 million. So basically a decent beat with strong guidance is what I'm expecting for tomorrow's call.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no way to know what their expenses are, so I can't really estimate EPS. And no way to know how many free users they have. So make of it what you will. Anyway their options chain is a bit shit.

Thoughts on Hecla Mining (HL)?,"I've traded HL for years as it rises and falls into the $6 range every couple of years. Things look like they might be ripe for the picking if we head for more downturn. They have plenty of gold/silver reserves, highest in their company history.([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hecla-mining-hl-expected-beat-153103321.html?.tsrc=rss](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hecla-mining-hl-expected-beat-153103321.html?.tsrc=rss)) 

&amp;#x200B;

At year-end 2018, HL says it had proven and probable gold reserves of 2.85M oz., up 26% Y/Y, proven and probable silver reserves of 191M oz., up 8%, and proven and probable lead reserves of 774K tons, a 5% increase of 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

They're also expected to beat earnings on their Q4 announcement coming up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Traditionally, gold/silver increase in price as the dollar stifles as people hedge against it, I'm wondering if anyone thinks this would be a good time to grab some cheap options OTM with a strike a few months in advance.

Jack in the Box DD (short),"This burger chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.5%.Revenues are expected to be $284.99 million, down 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.

Analysts in the last month raised estimates by around 0.82%. 

That’s usually a good sign and means that they have fine tuned the earnings to be more accurate. 

I think that they will probably just meet earnings and revenue, but will put out lower guidance based on their falling revenue and barley increased earnings, which would be fine for a cheap stock, but jack in the box is trading in the low 20s for PE.

I have some half ass DD. Exact Sciences - Ticker: EXAS

Exact Sciences, maker of the colon cancer diagnostic tool Cologuard

Tool that uses blood based biomarkers to detect colon cancer in early and precancerous stages. They send you a box, and then you shit in it and send it back to them and they tell you if you have cancer or not. You autists should know a thing or two about that.

What:

* We see weak top and/or bottom line earnings 2/21, with at least one missing  

Buying 2/22  $80 and $75 Puts at Open tomorrow 

Why:

* Analysts have  yoy revenue growth and EPS shrinking compared to that of last year - but there has been no significant negative price action yet
* Pfizer co-promotion ramp time slower than anticipated(this is a spidey sense), Holiday lull resulting in fewer kits(probably already baked into guidance ),no news in pipeline. Hard to say if any news about CG45 will come out, but I don’t think an FDA/CMS label change is a quick process. Current Label is only adults aged 50+ with average risk profile for CC
* CEO Kevin Conroy Sold 300k+ shares on 1/25 for \~25mm, CFO Jeffrey Elliott Sold 90,000 shares for \~7mm, and Chief Counsel Scott Coward sold 170,000 shares for \~13mm
   * Local Madison Wi News: “Conroy’s sales — cashing in stock options that were granted to him in 2009 and expire in 2019 — were not unexpected, and they have not hurt the price of the publicly traded company’s stock.”
   * A non-factor, just a pretty big sale from the C suite and this came soon after the departure of COO Maneesh Aurora 
* Pfizer Co-Promotion drove price +40% to 70+ and then positive earnings for Q3 kept the momentum, but I don't think they are worth nearly 5bn in MC add
* OTM Options Activity - 
* 5000+ Contracts 2/22 $75 Puts -  Could be an institutional hedge, but $75 is not unrealistic dropped more than 20% last miss + medtech/med device is volatile as shit around earnings, and Vanguard among other big holders have super low averages
* 5000+ Contracts 2/22 $80 Puts 
* Not a ton of traction on the Call Side 
* Price sitting way above the 30, 50, and 200 day moving averages 
* RSI Sitting at Overbought @ mid to high 60’s

Why Not: 

* Pfizer Cooperation could result in a big guidance increase 
   * Mark Stenhouse + Pfizer Co-Pro could seriously fire up the salesforce 
* Pipeline News
   * They’ve been known to drop bombs 
* New In-Network Providers
   * Pulled off Anthem BC/BS  Contract for Q2 Earnings
* Several Analysts set targets in the mid 90’s-110’s 
   * They actually know what they’re doing I think
* I am totally off base like 90% of you and I lose all $1000 in my account
   * I’m a college student, I’m sorry I’m poor ",TheBigChork,1550540577,35,24,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/as4vhi/exact_sciences_exas_earnings_play_221_dd/
Nio,"I want to believe that $Nio is the one! I was so ready to jump on the nio fan club. I decided that since the market was closed and I couldn't go all In i would do some research.  Hopefully you guys will all tell me I'm completely wrong about them.  Then I'll know for sure I'm completely right and I will just watch from the sidelines and say hey look I was right. Anyway let me start.

Bull cases: Nio is touted as the Tesla of China. Only better China is undergoing a ev shift.  Videos of the Nio factory look so damn sweet and they are promising well get nio sold in the US by 2020. If you go to their wikipedia page it appears that they are legit https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIO_(car_company)
Setting all kinda of records with their sweet as sports car . They have a fb group and some iPhone app grp thing i didn't look into yet. Stock twits is super excited about the er upcoming. Tesla said on tv interview they are losing their competitive advantage with their batteries technology.  Tesla is too open with there IP and nio is china  and would just steal IP anyway.  Blah blah. 

My bear case.  My reeee as was bored and wanted to see if I could trade in foreign markets so i was like oh why not trade nio in its home country.  I couldn't find anything I really wanted to also because arent china market open while we're all sleeping?  I started asking around it seems they are only traded in the US I found  this old market watch article on them 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/58E5BE6A-9FDC-11E8-ABEE-9079FD1B93A6

It says that 
Unusual—and risky—corporate structure

Like many Chinese companies with listings outside of China, Nio is a variable-interest entity, or VIE, a structure created in the 1990s as a workaround for Chinese companies that are not allowed to have direct foreign ownership.

Anyways I was already concerned about the IPO lockup date that is over on March 15th or 18th however this could be seen as a short term bull reason cause you know china is going to pump this up before that date

So why would this great new car company (car stocks stink) based in china only trade in the u.s. market? Why is the stock twits pumps excited for an ER that's possibly going to show massive cash flow issues and no revenue? If this really is the tesla of china where is the self driving car technology? Why was I changed an ADR fee with my webul account that was about .75 cents per share?

Some DD on big pharma,"ICYMI, a [proposal](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apos-official-trump-proposes-plan-010100521.html) out of the Trump Administration came earlier in the month that would end rebate schemes used by big pharma producers to monopolize their drugs. Brand-name drug makers pay billions in rebates to PBMs and insurers for preferential treatment of their drugs vs. others and vs. generics, namely for biologics.

 J&amp;J, for instance, paid out [$15 billion](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/johnson-johnson-offers-up-15b-2017-discounts-leading-to-its-first-negative-price-change) in rebates in 2017 to keep biosimilars and generics from gaining traction in the market. Trump should sign the proposal into final rule within the next few months, and there's almost nothing big pharma can do about it (from a legal standpoint). The only ways it can be prevented is if the HHS disapproves, which won't happen considering they've already expressed their approval, or via a [judicial review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rulemaking) which would only succeed if the rule ""exceeds the rulemaking authority granted by the authorizing legislation \[or if\] the agency improperly followed the process for public notice and comment"", neither of which will be the case. This is well within the authority of Daddy Trump and the HHS and we can assume no public notice/comment guidelines will be broken.

 This gets interesting when considering the actual effect on big pharma. I think there's a chance the savings in what would have been rebate payments may initially exceed the losses from a level playing field, but it could be that insurers immediately start only covering the cheapest available options (biosimilars and generics) which would have the opposite effect. Regardless, I think a final rule change announcement would be followed by a 5% drop in share price for JNJ and potentially MRK/NVS (biggest brand name producers). The catch 22 is that pharma companies have essentially convinced the public that rebates are a burden to them and PBMs force them to pay without any benefit to drug producers, which is probably the case for the vast majority of non-mega caps. So there's a small chance the announcement could initially catalyze JNJ/MRK/NVS. 

Once the effects are felt and begin to show in quarterly reports, though, shit will get real. So the gamble play here is **JNJ**/MRK/NVS puts in anticipation of a final rule change announcement, which should come by mid-Q2 at the latest. The safer play is to wait to make sure the rule change is finalized and searching for some less-autistic analysis on when/to what degree this will affect JNJ/MRK/NVS. I'm holding off for the latter. Let me know what you guys' tendie valuation is here.",nsg_vwap,1550262682,1,7,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ar0wl9/some_dd_on_big_pharma/

Investing in Cannabis: a brief overview of a true YOLO opportunity,"We are all extremely lucky to be witnessing the end of marijuana prohibition in the developed world. This is a market that will forever change the economic landscape for the countries involved in bringing about a legal marketplace. For investment purposes The Marijuana sector is comprised of two main markets at the moment IMO. There is Canada and there is the United States. 

In Canada marijuana has had a strong country wide recognized legal marijuana system built for corporate control since the introduction of the MMPR in 2013. Provinces and their national govt have been in lockstep throughout (mostly) and this has created stability for investors. This has led to companies such as Tilray and Canopy Growth Corp and a few other small corporate entities sucking up Billions of real investment dollars from individuals and even [Fortune 500 beverage companies](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/canopy-growth-closes-5-billion-constellation-brands-investment-transaction/). Accordingly this resulted in a gross overvaluation of these companies that operate legal cannabis operations. Take a look at these [financial reports](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/financials/) and tell me if this seems like an effectively managed and run outfit. No one cares about what I see as fairly obvious poor management and at its peak this company was worth over 10 Billion in market cap.

In the US everything is fragmented by unique state laws. The one unifying law is the schedule 1 status that dictates federal illegality. This is where opportunity for us lies. Due to this status that’s purely [fucking stupid](https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling) investment banks and corporations such as the one that gifted Canopy 4 Billion can not reasonably invest into these companies that are in many ways far outperforming Canopy at the time of that multi billion dollar investment. All while existing in far more attractive markets once the concern of federal interference is lifted. Imagine investing in UBER or Facebook far before a bank or large stakeholder gave them billions of dollars in return for a large interest of the company. This is where the marijuana industry is at in the United States. You can invest before the banks and financial institutions.

I don’t want to go into too much detail about the Canadian market but the point is that the entire nation is comparable to the state of California with absolutely none of the branding potential due to many different factors. Canada may lead in the international market opportunities but its apparent that that is slowly developing and not as attractive as Canadian companies may hope it to be [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/monazhang/2017/11/07/global-marijuana-market-31-billion-investors-cautious/amp/). imo the US is a far more attractive business space for cannabis due to available expendable income and branding potential. 

At the end of the day investing in this sector is about finding the next McDonald’s or Starbucks. Anyone can sell a cup of coffee or a shitty cheeseburger (or mediocre weed). Yet here are two mega billion dollar corporations that have billions of people across the world addicted to their product. This is what I’m looking for. As someone who is pretty experienced trying different quality weed;  in my opinion the company that takes the lead is going to be about delivering quality of product (unlike Starbucks and McDonalds) and the leader is far from established at the moment. 

I was going to make this a lot more detailed with more links but I’m going to leave a lot of the digging to you. Most of the info you need is going to be in the corporate documents. You should take the time and learn to read 10-q, k, and all corporate documents when making an investment of this length. I’ll start taking profits after large institutions begin making sizable investments similar to constellation’s. Could be a year, or 5. I really can’t say with certainty but I do feel it’s coming sooner rather than later with bipartisan legislation such as the [S.T.A.T.E.S. Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/STATES_Act) being introduced. The political aspect of this is continuously moving in the right direction and there is strong indication that big banks are pushing the right people towards cannabis reform with Trump signaling his support as well as other traditionally conservative (towards drug policy) politicians.

Credit to u/CannaVestments for this quick [overview](https://imgur.com/a/dpv4qVi) which is accurate to my knowledge.

(TCNNF) The one I like the most is Trulieve [link](https://vimeo.com/313083903). They dominate the Florida market with over 500k sq ft of grow space and soon to be 30 dispensaries. No other company dominates a region like trulieve and they are doing it in one of the most attractive marijuana markets in the world with tourism and retirees everywhere to give them their expendable income once full legalization comes into effect. Financials are attractive [link](https://www.trulieve.com/investors). The only public company in the entire industry worldwide with financials that look like an actually profitable and compelling investment. More than that is their philosophy of business. They don’t make massive acquisitions. Their 4 million dollar investment in Massachusetts (100k sq ft cultivation license + 3 dispensaries I believe) can easily turn into 4 million a quarter in roughly a year. This is good for shareholders which btw is majority insider controlled and locked up until July [link](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/trulieve-cannabis-corp-announces-voluntary-lock-up-agreements-with-company-founders-804831853.html). Right now fully diluted the company is valued around 1B in market cap. Compared to peers this is a steal. Canopy saw 10B and this company had better revs last reported quarter in 2018 (annual report due on April 30) not to mention strong profits and all the other important metrics that put its peers to shame. Compared to canopy’s valuation you can see why I’m so excited about this opportunity.

I think the fear for investors here is the market is immature and people are doubting they can hold onto their lead. Florida has previously capped stores to 30 and many other operators had yet to build out. Trulieve however just won an important suit that has ruled that cap unconstitutional [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-ne-judge-marijuana-dispensaries-cap-20190204-story,amp.html). I think it’s too late for competitors and it’s trulieves market to lose based on government and legal actions recently. The cost to entry is high and every other competitor is operating in debt and making acquisitions that cost hundreds of millions of dollars instead of organic growth. 

The other issue is that they don’t have the license getting skills in other states and will have to make large acquisitions going forward, which may be true but I think patience will reveal opportunity like in Massachusetts. They will target cheaper license getters or struggling license holders without the means or knowledge to buildout and use their profits while their competitors struggle with debt. This is my yolo essentially. I’ll diversify but due to share structure and insider control as well as the other factors this is the most attractive company in the US by a large margin imo. I think anything under $15 is a good buy and don’t think it stays under $20 much longer.

(GTBIF) The next one I like is green thumb industries [link](https://investors.gtigrows.com/investors/overview/default.aspx). This one has been making acquisitions that have been [massive](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/13/1650439/0/en/Green-Thumb-Industries-Inc-GTI-Expands-with-the-Acquisition-of-Integral-Associates-Nevada-s-Top-Cannabis-Operator.html) but they aren’t stupid moves unlike some of its peers (medmen) who have spent egregious amounts on unestablished license holders. They bought a [company](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/essence-cannabis-dispensary-awarded-new-licenses-to-expand-to-california-300768648.html) that afterwards won a very unique and competitive license in West Hollywood. They also won a very competitive and valuable license in [New Jersey](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/12/17/1668365/0/en/National-Cannabis-Company-Green-Thumb-Industries-GTI-Awarded-Cultivation-Processing-and-Retail-License-in-New-Jersey.html). This is the key to long term growth in the industry while maintaining shareholder value. A license can cost a few million vs buying a license holder which can cost tens of millions or hundreds of millions depending on development so whoever has the best license getters in the industry are going to be at a serious advantage for long term growth. Financials aren’t horrible compared to the rest of the sector and they are positioned well in Illinois with around 100k sq ft in grow space. Illinois just elected a pro legalization governor. Market cap is around 1.5 B. overall I trust this company and its branding efforts (rise dispensaries) to make it an established player in the market. They are however in buildout mode so financials might not look as pretty this year and dilution will be happening and therefore will see good buying opportunities this year imo. I’d be happy to pick some more up around $7.

Something to keep in mind when doing your own due diligence is these m.s.o. (Multi state operators) like to count their unbuilt licenses as if they exist. In Florida for example, it seems companies were granted 30 dispensaries by default so a lot of mso, without even building out 1, have greatly inflated their dispensary numbers. Focus on who actually has the most buildings functioning and distributing product. That will tell you who is ahead. I personally am focused on companies that dominate an area which doesn’t necessarily mean they will have the most dispensaries-just the best locations to saturate a market. 

(CURLF) I don’t like curaleaf [link](https://content.equisolve.net/curaleaf/news/2018-11-26_Curaleaf_Reports_Third_Quarter_2018_Financial_and__29.pdf) because of overvaluation (mc around 2.5B) but it’s probably wise to pick up a piece of these guys when the opportunity arises. They were early in New Jersey which is a very attractive market and bring in significant revenue. They have 20 operational dispensaries in FL and over 650k sq ft of cultivation space across all states they operate in according to their investor presentation. It will be telling if they can make a significant dent to trulieves footprint in Florida or if they will be The Burger King to trulieves McDonalds. Trulieve has maintained over 60% of market share in Florida so I question Curaleafs potential to outcompete competitors in other states as well. They also are initiating a share [buyback](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/curaleaf-announces-launch-of-share-buyback-program-300760620.html) which at this stage is a huge red flag while green thumb is acquiring serious license getters and Florida competitor trulieve is opening 6 stores in the upcoming few months. I’m looking for a strong dip in the upcoming year and might buy some around $4.

(Acrgf) Acreage has made some dumbfounding decisions that include millions of dollars of investment in the state of Iowa which has only legalized cbd and in general have fairly unattractive locations including Oregon and Maine [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/oregons-weed-glut-what-happens-to-excess-pot-697985/amp/). They also missed the boat in Florida and look a little desperate with this [acquisition](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/acreage-holdings-enters-florida-medical-cannabis-market-with-67-million-acquisition-natures-way/) made recently. Imo They are b listers from my due diligence (Burger King might be too much of a compliment) but they’re the best politically connected [link](https://m.benzinga.com/article/12716495) and are well positioned financially to be a force in the sector. Already distributing in Jersey (125k sqft cultivation facility) which is big. If I see stupid moves I stay away especially if they are already overvalued [link](http://investors.acreageholdings.com/file/Index?KeyFile=395942626) but this should definitely be on your radar (also has 100k sqft cultivation in NY) . This thing trades strong and I think a lot of big money is behind it. I will probably diversify and pick up some when an opportunity presents itself. Hoping to have an opportunity to buy around ~$12-15 because I don’t think they are deserving of a market cap of more than about 1.5B at the moment and currently are trading around a 3B market cap.

Another thing is to do your due diligence in each states cannabis economy as each is incredibly unique. Right now Oregon, Washington and Colorado are not business friendly (in terms of helping a balance sheet look nicer) even though Colorado and Washington are very attractive revenue wise. Some states limit monopolies or have no limit in dispensaries/cultivation which reduces economic upside at the moment. Maryland has a limit (cant find a link so might need to fact check me on this) on how much one company can own of the state which will be interesting to see how it’s upheld as the market merges. Cali has overtaxed everything so the black market continues to be very influential there but whoever takes the lead in this state (medmen currently) will be a formidable force as the black market slowly fades from existence. Nevada is a good economy due to limiting the licenses given out and flower prices were rising for a while. Vegas is huge from a branding perspective. Green thumb is the leader here after their big acquisition. Jersey is just getting around to implementing medical expansion (thanks to fat bastard aka Chris Christie) so companies there haven’t even capitalized on that population density yet. Most of this is really common sense and comes down to basic supply vs. demand economics. The northeast especially, where there are tons of non smokers without access to quality black market connects are going to pour hundreds of dollars into brick and mortar stores each month imo so I’m paying close attention to Mass/NJ/NY in the coming year to see who takes the lead there.


(MMNFF) Medmen is garbage and idc to go in depth on why [link](https://equity.guru/2018/05/28/medmen-goes-public-tuesday-three-executives-will-make-money-deal/). It would be a lengthy write up. They have the best market penetration in Cali so far and I do think they will be relevant in 10 years but investment potential isn’t as attractive as their peers. Insiders sold out for a reason in my opinion [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/marijuana-retailer-medmen-acquires-pharmacann-for-682-million-2018-10). this acquisition is going to take a decade if not more to pay off assuming it does. Just horrible mismanagement of shareholder value IMO. 

(CRLBF) Cresco labs are Chicago based and have focused their efforts in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ohio [link](https://investors.crescolabs.com/investors/overview/default.aspx) Management seems to be top tier but I think it’s a little pricy at the moment (~2B) for what they own. The main guy sits on a committee with newly elected Pritzker in Illinois (140k sq ft cultivation in IL) and they will be major players I think [link](https://investors.crescolabs.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Cresco-Labs-Co-founder-and-CEO-Charles-Bachtell-Appointed-to-Cannabis-Legalization-Subcommittee-of-Illinoimedmen-acquires-pharmacann-for-682-s-Governor-elect-JB-Pritzkers-Transition-Team/default.aspx). I’m looking to diversify with these guys when an opportunity presents itself. Hoping for a chance around $5.

(ITHUF) Another interesting company is Ianthus [link](https://www.ianthuscapital.com/investors). They recently merged with MPX and imo it has legitimized their future. Ianthus holds attractive licenses in NY and FL but has no proven growth or brand perception. Mpx on The other hand has strong brand perception (although recently they’ve been getting poor reviews on products) and proven growth and also holds some attractive licenses in AZ, MD, and NJ among others [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/two-new-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-coming-to-atlantic-city-vineland/article_8bceb880-437d-5d4e-ab89-7429c53d7fc5.amp.html).
Together I think they will be a value buy at some point. Unfortunately both don’t have enough operating capital to fund their growth and will need funding to execute and fulfill their potential. when an opportunity presents itself I’ll buy a small piece for diversification. I’m looking for sub $3 myself.

(HTHHF) There is also Harvest Health and Recreation [link](https://www.harvestinc.com/industry-experience/). Not very familiar with them but they seem to be strong license getters and have good reviews. Definitely overpriced at the moment. I’ll look for a buy op under $4. 


A company to look out for is Columbia Care [link](https://www.col-care.com). They have a huge presence in the northeast and have yet to go public. Won a New Jersey license recently. 

(DXBRF) There is also Dixie brands [link](http://dixieelixirs.com/ir-dashboard/). This is where long term future is in the industry. Beverages are a socialized means of getting fucked up. The beverage leader will normalize getting high. Right now that’s Dixie. My concern here is this is decades away from normalizing. I don’t think the market for drinks is as attractive an investment short term as the actual infrastructure to grow the plant. Also my opinion is established brands such as Coca Cola will simply come in and have better brand recognition immediately. Nothing Dixie or any edible manufacturer is doing is necessarily a secret or patentable from my understanding so all the big beverage players have to do is hire the right people and they will immediately dominate a company like Dixie. 

Something else to look out for is investor presentations and revenue forecasts. I’ve seen quite a few but the one that stands out the most is acreages that was just absolute bullshit. Do not under any circumstance trust guidance from companies. I think revenues will grow slower than most will admit but the market will continue to overvalue these companies as we get closer to large capital investing in the US cannabis space. Companies that have established presence in growing markets such as Trulieve I’ll trust far more than unestablished companies with poor footing like Acreage to give accurate projections. At the end of the day there are too many variables in a completely new market segment to rely on company projections.

Other ancillary companies for “safer” investment include Scott’s Miracle Grow (SMG) which I think will dominate the self grow industry as well as the commercial growing infrastructure based on some of their recent acquisitions. The other sector I’m somewhat familiar with is mass spectrometry. Labs to test marijuana composition are going to be a huge need and mass spectrometers and liquid chromatography will be in high demand. I know Waters (WAT) specializes in spectrometry. Also (TMO) Thermo Fisher and (PKI) PerkinElmer for laboratory needs. I haven’t actually done my due diligence on these guys financials and fundamentals though.


That’s it I think. Some smaller players exist but these are the big boys that have the most growth potential. If you have a thought, question or comment about anything I’d love to hear it, especially if you are familiar with any of these companies or have your own personal insights to share. There will likely be more relevant companies that go public so I’ll keep my eyes open and let you know if I see anything worthwhile. I’m looking forward to the market consolidating when bigger money gets to join in. These are just my opinions so do your own due diligence and best of luck!

Martin Shkreli’s RDEB Speculation,"In our boy Shkreli's recent blog post ([http://martinshkreli.com/uncategorized/2-7-2019/](http://martinshkreli.com/uncategorized/2-7-2019/)) he states, ""Looked at the RDEB companies: FCSC, KRYS, ABEO. Looks like an investing opportunity, both long and short. Not 100% sure which stock is which 🙂.""

&amp;#x200B;

Not entirely sure how much value RDEB therapy is worth cause its looks really rare (like 200 cases in US per year), but I bought FANG calls thinking it was a fund tracking Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google when it was really an energy company so I figured let's fucking go boys. 

&amp;#x200B;

My sub par DD (not investment advice as I have no knowledge in this field and only spent like 30 min):

FCSC

They are behind the pack on this development clearly shown by the pipelines:

[http://fibrocell.com/pipeline-clinical-trials/](http://fibrocell.com/pipeline-clinical-trials/)

[https://www.abeonatherapeutics.com/research-development#pipeline](https://www.abeonatherapeutics.com/research-development#pipeline)

[https://www.krystalbio.com/focus/pipeline/](https://www.krystalbio.com/focus/pipeline/)

&amp;#x200B;

Their website blows compared to the other two.  If you don't market yourself well, you won't get sales.  Therefore, they either have a while before this pops off and hits the market or they will die before then.

Their market cap in mm instead of $M is smaller than my average according to google schlong so serious tendies will be made if they amount to something.

&amp;#x200B;

KRYS

Interesting team experience here... But IDK if knowledge transfers so well.  The main two leaders were involved in development of Adderall XR and Vyvanse. I really want to throw tendies as homage for helping me get my engineering degree and erode my nasal cavity, but to me these developments are totally different.

It looks like they scalped majority of the leadership from their previous companies.  I think the lack of diversified experience could hurt them.

I do like their product scope as they are completely focused on developing solutions for skin diseases.  I'd think this could lead to cheaper product development.

&amp;#x200B;

ABEO

Based on the leadership, I think this company has the best credentials.  My credentials look good though, and I spent 20 minutes of my Friday morning typing this up for a group of autists that I don't know instead of working.

They look to be diversified in experience and knowledge, and their product line is diversified too.  They look to have big goals based on their scope, but being all over the map might hurt them.

Based on their statements, Phase III kicks off in the middle of this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

I see success in RDEB being as follows:

1. ABEO
2. KRYS
3. FCSC

Feedback on how to determine the value of RDEB solutions and any DD from someone that is more on the spectrum is appreciated.",SlayAndChay,1549635306,1,9,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aogwki/martin_shkrelis_rdeb_speculation/

GUIDE: You need 1.6m to never work a day in your life and live as a below average joe.,"So basically you sell your ass for 1.6 or do something it’s not that hard to get 1.6m. 


When you finish accumulating that invest in SPY at 270. You can invest in other shit but let’s say you’re dumb and you buy SPY. 


DIVIDEND: SPY pays 1.44$ in dividend so if you want to get 3000$ a month you’ll have to buy 2084 shares x 3 = 6250 shares and that will cost ya 1.6m dollars. You’ll have 3k a month or 9k every three month excluding taxes. BUT WAIT! You can write box spreads to idiots and make some extra but the income from that will be going towards your taxes, food, gas, mens, and aids medication from selling ass. Then you’ll have some leftovers to pay for the Xanax because autism.

TTWO Still Cheap Going into Earnings [Napkin Due Diligence Inside],"RDRII sold 17 million units in its first two weeks. This is the only disclosed unit sales numbers. The official unit sales will probably be disclosed next earnings in early Feb. Online mode is just rolling out and improving; microtransactions will provide consistent cash flow for the next 2-3 years. PC version will likely be released EOY, selling millions more copies. Next generation consoles will also roll out, and RDRII will be a best seller on those, too. For long-term investors, GTA6 will mint even more. Massive contract recently signed with the NBA to produce 2k for coming years (2k was the 3rd best selling game in 2018; RDRII was the first).

Worked at a L/S fund last summer and had the chance to review a bunch of the equity research. Most blue-sky EPS estimates had &lt;25m unit sales in the holiday season implying a \~$135 PT. 

The whole gaming sector is flatline/trending downward on the Nvidia and China news... This makes little sense for TTWO, whose only big PC game was released in 2015 (GTAV). It's certainly possible that Nvidia's lackluster graphics card sales originate from a macro-trend of saturation in video games, but I'm extremely skeptical. Multiple signals point to video game sales and consumer confidence being at an all-time high last quarter. Just look at Apple's performance in non-China sectors. Speaking of which, this thing also has virtually no China exposure as console video game sales in China have long been known to be negligible.

Estimating Amazon earnings based on website traffic,"*Note: This analysis covers* *Amazon.com* *and not international versions. It contains vague projections and is not to be considered financial or investment advice.*

&amp;#x200B;

We are going to start off by analyzing Amazon's 2017 and 2018 Q3 (July-Sept.) website traffic stats.

The two metrics we need for this analysis is the percentage of search engine traffic out of all Amazon.com traffic and some actual search figures.

By using [archive.org](https://archive.org)'s Wayback Machine, we go back in time to find the relevant search traffic percentage statistics for both periods. The most reliable method I could think of is using Alexa.com data here. An additional advantage is that Alexa.com displays the percentage for the preceding three months which is just what we need. Here are the archived pages from [02Oct2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20171002004533/https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/amazon.com) and [02Oct2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181002110151/alexa.com/siteinfo/amazon.com). The percentage of traffic that comes from search engines during the preceding quarters is 20.7% and 22.4%, respectively.

Now we need actual search figures. For this we will use [Semrush.com](https://Semrush.com), a keyword analysis company. The great thing about it is that you only need to input the domain (amazon.com in our case) and it will give you the estimated number of organic and paid search visits for each month.

After adding up the numbers we get that Amazon.com received 1.204B and 2.328B search visits during Q3 2017 and Q3 2018 respectively. This huge increase is mainly due to Amazon's rise in rankings for unbranded search terms (like: ""best books about marketing 2018"" etc.) and not the increase in branded searches (like: ""marketing books on amazon""). Using the search traffic percentages we obtained earlier, as well as discounting the visits that only resulted in one pageview (utilizing alexa.com's bounce rate figures) we can calculate that Amazon.com received 4.153B and 7.275B visits in the analyzed quarters.

The method:

(Semrush search traffic) / (Alexa.com historical search traffic percentage) \* 100 \* (1 - ((Alexa.com historical bounce rates)/100)) = Number of U.S. visits to Amazon.com that resulted in multiple pageviews.

The numbers we got show a 75% increase year-on-year. The revenue growth YoY for the two Q3s was 29.35% ($43.74B -&gt; $56.58B). This means that the percentage increase of visits is 2.5615 times that of the percentage increase of revenue.

**If we calculate the same traffic stats for the Q4s of 2017 and 2018 we get: 4.839B and 7.290B visits. That's an increase of 50.64%. If we suspect that the ratio between revenue growth and visitor growth stays the same we get a projected revenue growth of 19.77% YoY which would mean $72.46B in rev. for Q4 2018. This number is a little over the street consensus of $71.9B and is at the top end of Amazon's guidance possibly resulting in tendies for bulls (predicting a 4-5% surge AH).**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Based on Amazon.com's** **website traffic metrics a Q4 revenue of $72.46B and a 19.77% growth YoY is projected in the post above.**

&amp;#x200B;

*Further things to note:*

*This analysis does not include anything about AWS, Amazon's growing ad business and other stuff, though the traffic stats do include* *aws.amazon.com**,* *sellercentral.amazon.com* *and other subdomains. The analysis is just a vague projection based on a limited number of metrics. I would love to hear your thoughts on it though.*",akos_barta,1548953541,1,19,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/alrgp1/estimating_amazon_earnings_based_on_website/

Short TU,"TELUS is a Canadian telecom provider that works with Huawei in rolling out 5G in Canada. 

If Canada bans Huawei equipment, TELUS will drop like a rock. It dropped bigly on the arrest of Huawei princess news. 

I think there’s a very high likely hood they will be banned. Relations have soured big time after Canada arrested Huawei princess, China arrested a Canadian businessmen and sentenced a Canadian criminal to death. 

Recently Canadian China ambassador told Canada there would be repercussions if they banned Huawei. Canada fired him. Canada also announced big funding for Huawei’s competitor Nokia, probably signaling they can and will move to an alternative. We are here now.

TU has recovered a bit from the arrest drop and looks ready for another pullback if Canada announces a ban on Huawei. 

I think the US will put huge pressure on Canada to ban Huawei. US has threatened to share less information with Canada if they allow Huawei into their networks because it poses a national security risk for the US. I think Canada will tow the line. Out of the FIVE eyes intelligence countries, Australia’s, New Zealand, and US have banned Huawei. I think Canada will join the list. 

If they are willing to arrest the Huawei princess for the US, I think they will ban Huawei for the US.

China has showed aggressive retaliation against Canada so far. So Canada might be scared to ban them and risk economic troubles. However I think pressure from US will too great.

If you think they will ban, buy puts with a longer expiration. I’m debating a YOLO as I’m quite confident in this play. ",fuk_normies,1548764367,1,26,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/akzgqd/short_tu/

FNMA Dilution Plan?,"
Is there currently a best thinking plan out there which details how the FNMA common equity gets wiped out?  We all know dilution is the big risk but how would that actually play out? Is there a historical precedent to go by?

If we start with the Moelis plan as the best case scenario for common (all lawsuits aside) what is a detailed version of the worst case?  

Obviously the easy answer is a massive secondary etc., but that would wipe out the warrants. Is there a scenario that crushes the common equity but still preserves Treasury’s potential gain in the warrants?

I know this forum typically exhibits bullish confirmation bias, and at the same time everyone knows that there is potential for the common to go to zero, but i haven’t seen a real detailed plan which explains how that massive dilution would work especially when taking the warrants into consideration.

FNMAS vs FNMA . Which to pick? (GSE's) (PFDS VS COMMONS),"As most of you have seen, FNMA and FMCC are starting to pick up again and it seems like something is going to happen for real this time. I feel a fiduciary duty to my fellow autists, despite the fact many of tried (and succeeded) to delete my posts as well as my comments, to point you all in the right direction as this can potentially make a difference in your holding decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

Just as a disclaimer, 95% of my portfolio is in PFDs and 5% in commons, so keep that in mind as you read below.

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you just being introduced to Fannie and Freddie, you most likely are purchasing FNMA and FMCC. This is a complex scenario and there is a difference between the PFDs and the commons. I don't really feel like posting what has been posted ad nauseum for a while now, but you can search on seeking alpha for Glen Bradford and read his analysis there.

&amp;#x200B;

but to summarize, most of my holdings are in PFD's for the following 3 reasons

1. I don't expect the ceiling (max return) for each class to be drastically different. I project Commons to be worth about $5-$10 when everything is said and done. Right now they trade at $3 so it's about another 80% return and up to a 300% return. I expect the PFDs to hit par, and right now they trade for about 40 cents on the dollar, which  means there is about a 150% opportunity remaining. I estimate the expected value to be roughly the same, given the variable trading range and uncertainty with a capital raise surrounding commons
2. PFD shareholders have a larger voice than the commons. Anything that is set forth and done I believe needs to be voted on by PFD shareholders, as they will need to settle the current lawsuits before a recap &amp; release (this is my understanding and it could be incorrect). The common shareholders have no say in how they are recapped and released, and that makes me very uncomfortable to be holding such a large position, with absolutely no leverage. I have not mapped out a scenario where commons win and PFDS do not. The three being:
   1. PFDS win, Commons win
   2. PFDS Lose, Commons lose 
   3. PFDS win, Commons lose
3. My last reason, which so far has been incorrect as commons have outperformed PFDS in the last 3 weeks (but in fairness to myself, in the last year PFDs have held more value and have outperformed commons) I think the PFDs, when the plan is announced will rise to par,  which at then i see another potential opportunity to double dip into commons if I see the opportunity. There is another possibility that PFDs get converted to commons, which again I think they will be converted at a favorable rate.

Overall, I expect scenario 1 (both win) to play out.... raising 150B and making 16B a year shouldn't be THAT hard, and the government (if warrants are exercised) have an incentive to maximize their returns. The commons to me are a lottery ticket, while the PFDs is where I expect to make my return.

While it’s true that MCD goes up in recessions (people sad and broke= let’s go to mc Donald’s) this really isn’t the primary reason (we haven’t gone through 10 recessions this year even though this is the primary concensus on WSB). 

The real reason it has gone up is the government shutdown (people sad and broke). In hindsight, I should’ve bought MCD when trump became president (he loves MCD and hes an expert on making people sad and broke)

My thoughts on Altria($MO)......Let the autism commence,"Altria has been a cash cow for dividend investors for much of the past half century.....that is until they killed off their customers(literally). Its focused almost entirely on the US tobacco market, and, as I'm sure you Autists know, the US is experiencing record low levels of smokers, along with ever increasing pushback to smoking from health lobbying groups and culture in general. It is no longer considered cool to smoke, to put it simply, and those who do die.

This has led Altria to expand considerable amounts of money on their version of R&amp;D for their next product. Initially, this was focused on the promise of ""heat not burn"" tobacco products. These old school tobacco vapes are similar in function to vapes used to smoke leaf marijuana, and although they still are adverse to the health of the user, they are to a decent degree safer. The problem, for Altria, was the immense pushback from the government, which saw such devices as not only enabling a new generation of smokers to take up the pipe, but also as a means of fostering ciggy sales, as pure combustion tobacco, as a result of the temperatures experienced and the ionization of the nicotine molecule, provide for a greater degree of uptake of nicotine, and therefore may be considered more pleasurable. Basically the ""a heat not burn"" could offer a seemingly innocent path for more tobacco users.

However, as I'm sure all are aware, out of nowhere came the Chads. Those tools you see everywhere who take up the newest fad(perhaps it's their name) an attempt in a pretensions sort of way to convey to the world that they do indeed fit in, and are an example of being ""cool"". (Related trivia for the day, the word cool was first used by African American Jazz musicians, and one of the first ciggarette brands marketed to African Americans picked up on this trend and took the word mainstream. The Kool brand of ciggarettes was the first marketed specifically towards African Americans and is one of the reasons this demographic largely smokes menthol cigarettes to this day)

Anyways, with the Chads came the vaping. No longer was the e-ciggarete a fringe device advertised on the radio for hacking, coughing, stinking, near death nicotine addicts as a way to finally quit. Vaping became a way for the Chads of the world to have their cake and eat it too, in other words enjoy smoking nicotine thinkng they are cool while also keeping their health in check. Seriously, total Chad move. As I'm sure you are all aware, vaping is now much more ubiquitous than ever before, with middle schoolers once again experiencing the true terror of peer pressure as they have their first puff of a vape.

This change of events, perhaps serendipitously on behalf of the Chads, gave Altria their Trump card. Now, they not only had a potential product that would allow for their customers to not merely be slaughtered by their product, but also an honest to god ally in their battle against the government and regulation, the doctors. A very autistic subgroup of society, Drs operate by fact, and take an oath of ""at first, do no harm"" in order to best serve their patients. It is this tenant that allowed for a majority of them to unvaryingly see that vaping allowed for a vast reduction in harm to users of tobacco products in a similar manner to the already medical practice of prescribing methadone to those addicted to opitates. Meanwhile, perhaps due to the Autistic tendencies of these health obsessed freaks, they failed to see the immense business consequences of such a move. Vaping will very well indeed bouy up the sales of conventional cigarettes in the youth subgroup as they are now able to enjoy a true smoke when they are out at the bars or simply need a stronger buzz(hiding their true Chad identity) while simultaneously maintaining their addiction in the meantime.

So, from a financial perspective where does Altria stand? They have recently invested a 35ish percent stake in Juul, the largest and most toolish of vape manufacturers. They are almost entirely focused on the US nicotine market, meaning they need not fear currency exchange rates as a threat to profits. They also have a potential product that not only facilitates their existing products, but also enables a differing mechanism of action and higher sales ceiling, as one can vape much more frequently than conventional ciggarettes due to the abscense of lung clogging tar(try smoking a pack of reds in a day and feel how your throat feels, whereas a Juul pod(equivalent to 20 cigarettes or a pack) a day is easy. Dont beleive me....check out this 100% certified chad https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna956356 ) Additionally, unlike regular smokes, nicotine is a much milder malignancy in regard to ones health. It is not carcinogenic. It does induce a moderate degree of exacerbation of cardiovascular disease and does lead to pre diabetic symptoms over the long term (30-40 years), meaning the most visible scars of the uses of tobacco products will now be invisible, invoking much less scorn from the common masses.

The problem of their financial plight lays in the field of politics. Both left and right, politics is opposed to the expansion of tobacco. Even the most conservative states comprised of the highest percentage of smokers despise the tobacco industry, as it kills off their voter base. With this being said, the bet will be that the Autist drs and the mass dissemination of ""info"" and ""public opinion"" will need to overcome the political mainstay of tobacco regulation. Already there are moves to significantly curtail the expansion of vapes and e-pods. Thankfully, it seem altria has outsmarted the government with the bait and switch tactic, with Juul stating they will stop direct brick and mortar sales of their e-pod sales, while simultaneously striking a deal with Altria to have Altria sell the pods instead.

So, long term I see, everything continuing as it is now, that Altria will be able to sow a new crop of nicotine addicts, and enable future cash flows to grow. They are also expanding into the recreational marijuana field, which, barring legalization, will allow them to have a two pronged attack at indulging Americans with addicting brain chemicals. In other words, become by far the world largest legal drug cartel. But....the term legal is key. Should government regulation become smarter, and are able to stymie their growth into a benevolent provider of pleasure...all will be lost.

TLDR: Chad's, although despicable, are indeed useful, even if it is not their intention. By making vapes mainstream, Altria is poised to consolidate a significant position in the Americsn e-ciggarette market, enabling a new generation of vapers and therefore cash flow. Throw in a joint or two, and you have a legalized cartel.

1. Data center is going away. Companies in the future will almost all be going to cloud instead of building out their own datacenters. It will soon make 0 sense for a company of any size to build out and maintain their own datacenter (cost, staff, redundancy, downtime, security, etc). Why would you spend all that money when you can just pay Jeff Bezos to do all that for you, save you the headache, give you 100x the security you'd have, and it's CHEAPER. Obviously cloud still requires server equipment but AMD's hope of taking small amounts of share with little players is going to fade out FAST. 

* AMD is going to miss on their goals to take data center market share from Intel
   * EPYC is actually insanely good but let's be real here. AMD is the nice guy that keeps his head down and works hard while Intel is the big bully that plays dirty and hustles. Doesn't matter how good your product is if you can't MARKET. AMD sucks at marketing (it is known). Especially necessary in the data center market where it costs a TON to swap out hardware for any player that matters.
* AMD will guide down on their expectations to break into the data center game (this is killer and the #1 reason shits gonna drill to the center of the earth)

2. GPUS not up to par

Critique my $PCG equity synopsis (AKA show me where my Autism has betrayed me),"Most likely what will happen will be PCG will go through chapter 11 and sell off much of their transmission and generation assets. An article I read estimated by doing this they could net around 22bil. These would be purchased by several newer utility companies backed by private investment and most likely with more protective insurance policies in addition to more conservative/higher yield debt backing. San Francisco has already expressed interest for buying out and municipalizing the assets of PG&amp;E in their district.

They will additionally recoup money by reneging on a series of Green Energy deals that were created as part of California's Green Energy Pact. This will also save them a couple billion dollars(as green energy is depreciating rapidly in price as technology improves, and the rates they pay are based on 2013-14 prices).

It's this second stipulation that will mainly be a threat to California, as not only will it lead to a political headache when it destroys the Green Energy Pact, but will also devastate the suppliers of that green energy. This has already taken place as several suppliers are down double digits(percentage) since the bankruptcy was declared.

For those saying ""it's impossible for them to break up"" I'd ask you to think about the business environment. As a shareholder, who already owns an insolvent business, with the knowledge that a fire in 2017 killed 30ish people and cost several billion in liabilities for your company, and in 2018 a fire killed 80 people and caused a record 30 billion in damages, and with knowledge that the fire risk will only increase in the future, would you want to operate a business in this environment when you are on the hook for everything?

California has a law that utilities are ""strictly liable"" for any fire damage caused by their utilities even if they are in perfect working order. So basically, unless this law is changed, which is doubtful as insurance companies will vehemently oppose its change as then they are on the hook, don't expect PCG to have anything to do with PG&amp;E in the future unless they are not fully on the hook for the next fire. 

As for what will california do/whether then will bail them out it depends. If they bail them out and let them raise rates, while still being liable for future fires they will have to deal with the probability that this will happen again in the future and the fact that this will make the voters angry. If they let them break up, they have to deal with the fact that rates will rise and that their Green Energy Pact will be a failure. If they municipalize the entity of the California grid they will need to find a way to hedge against the future fire liabilities that they will now assume.

The best case scenario for California would be to bail them out and amend the current law that stipulate utilities assume all risk and allow for rate increases not only as a result of the bailout but as a means to significantly increase fire prevention spending by the utilities. I dont think this is likely though as california will not only experience voter disapproval and lobbying against it by insurance companies, but also will need the stars to align in that the legislature will need to approve budgeting in addition to the Rate Committee approving major rate hikes. That's a lot of parties that will all need to agree with one another. Therefore I think it will break up/sell its assets.


TLDR:

1) Fuck you and your autism for not reading

2) only things that may stop the complete loss of equity value for shareholders would be if the state bails them out or if they are deemed not liable for the fire(as in their utilities did not cause the fire which there is no way to get inside information on to make a viable investment). Even then the state would also have to update their laws for who is liable for a fire. If the second does not happen, PG&amp;E(the subsidiary) may still resist continuing to operate in Cali due to the certainty of future fires.",DrTendies,1548205007,1,27,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aityof/critique_my_pcg_equity_synopsis_aka_show_me_where/
XLNX: Upcoming Growth?,"Fellow aspies: my spergie senses are tingling again, DD time.

TLDR: XLNX has been stuck in FPGA market since inception. Newly appointed CEO Peng is looking towards data centers for future growth with ACAPs. If adopted, ACAP has the ability to greatly expand XLNX business as data centers and the clouds grow (not to mention 5G).

Ugh. Just read the TLDR. Your tism says you're too lazy for DDs. You don't know about semiconductors or computer science, you just want tendies. DISCLOSURE: dont pretend my tism is below yours; I'm not a computer scientist, coder, techie, etc. I want tendies. So if you're using this as your research rather than a gateway/comparison I'd say forgo the tldr &amp; just invest with u/1R0NYMAN... Info here is found in XLNX, NVDA, INTC ERs as well as numerous articles on FPGA &amp; ACAP found on sites such as Forbes (a ton of articles actually), Nextplatform, Tom's Hardware. ACAP info found in XLNX published white paper. 

XLNX has made a number of shifts in 2018. Former CEO Moshe Gavrielov retired &amp; appointed Victor Peng. Peng announced that data centers would be their focus for the future (because duh. If you don't know the potential growth in data centers over the next 5-10yrs just buy SPY 2020 240p) with ACAP 7nm chips being key. (ACAP = Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform.) Research says that data accelerator market will go from 3B to 21.3B from '18 to 2023. That's 50% CAGR. ACAP chips are essentially XLNX's solution to the FPGA scale problem while also dealing with ASIC problems, namely that with ASIC the chip is what it is, new technology=new ASIC=millions &amp; years of development (development which, ofc, uses FPGAs to prototype).

Moore's Law is over. (So like... Moore's era?) This means that 7nm is small. Really small. Potentially only surpassed by 5nm (although the total aspies in comp sci have developed 3nm to 1nm so...). For speeds &amp; scaling to improve in cloud that means more accelerators. ACAP. Basically there are a number of seeming pros with one major con. I'll go over the pros below. The major detractor is (and again I do not code so I do not understand the full scale of what this means, although I can perhaps see the difficulties) that ACAP still contains FPGAs &amp; needs to be programmed. Additionally, XLNX has called ACAP ""Versal 7nm"" a MLaaS (Machine learning as a service). In addition to programming for FPGAs one would need to code in numerous other languages depending on ACAP application. The adoption in the industry may be dependant a bit on adaption to this. (If you know more about this/can clarify lmk somehow. Personally curious what programmers would say about this.)

Currently, data centers use NVDA &amp; INTC GPUs (ASIC). Basically XLNX wants a slice of this via ACAP. XLNX apparently shits on INTC's FPGAs (Altera) in both technology &amp; market share (XLNX ~60% vs ~35%), not to mention that INTC doesn't have anything close to an ACAP 7nm (they're currently floundering around with 10nm, constantly delaying release). If XLNX can pry INTC frozen, dead grip from data centers (along with NVDA's sweaty, leather jacket wearing grip) via ACAP they should get a nice slice of the data center accelerator pie. AMD has bet specifically on this as it has partnered with XLNX on their MLaaS to beat out their INTC &amp; NVDA (NGC) rivals. Fundamentally, the ACAP offers benefits even a sperg like me can -seemingly- understand. Their chips represent a shift from the years and millions of $ that ASIC development takes: ACAP is a platform for ""fast time to market compute acceleration."" Not to mention that ASICs die when tech improves, whereas ACAP is obviously adaptive. XLNX claims these are more energy efficient (7nm...), as well as being significantly faster.

Details from XLNX: ""Versal ACAP are built around... Network on Chip (NoC, which I guess is them one-upping SoC). ACAPs comprise: multicore scalar PS, CPM, AI accelerators &amp; complex signal processing, and programmable logic (PL)."" These contain up to 2,000 logic blocks, up to almost 4,000 dsp engines, and up to 400 AI engines. XLNX claims that it is at least 2.5X as fast as GPUs, and in some instances much more. (White Paper) XLNX claims this can be applied to data centers, 5G/SATCOM, defense/aerospace, ADAS, etc. 

For the r/wsb spergs (as opposed to comp sci spergs), XLNX has a seemingly low risk business. XLNX generates 28% revenue from US, 44% Asia (in Korea they are already deploying 5G), 20% Europe, 8% Japan while none of their customers represent greater than 10% of revenues (compared to SWKS &amp; QRVO which might as well be APPL subsidiaries by revenue). They dominate the traditional FPGA market and if ACAP adopts, they will expand to a NoC company, using their MLaaS relying on the field programmability for adaption. The market for this seems wide open &amp; quickly growing.

XLNX trades at ~20B market cap on net income of approx ~850M/yr. At an obviously high value, ACAP may be factored in at this point however, if adoption is positive ACAP may take XLNX to an entirely different place in the matter of a couple years. Finally, in the highly cyclic sector of semis, XLNX looks poised for sustained growth against the standard cycle if ACAP delivers. 

So yea. XLNX finally makes programmable compute accelerators that, according to XLNX, is a one-stop-shop NoC that scales at lower cost, uses less energy, and are faster than any other accelerator.

Tesla deedee - High tendie play,"I’ll share my power of autism with you and maybe we can all make some monies together. Here we go, let me break this down for ya:

**What’s the play?** TSLA mid march calls, $350+ strike price. 

**Why:** Few valid reasons for this play in my opinion.  First of all earnings coming on the 31st but those will likely be inline from expectations and may or may not be enough for the big pop, just depends what they say for guidance and in Q/A after.

The main reason For this play is a bit counter intuitive. Tesla has about $1 billion of debt maturing on March 1st. They have about 3 billion in the bank and they are not going to want to throw a 1/3 of their cash pile to this payment (need the money for the 2 giga factories development plus continued r&amp;d/tooling/manufacturing costs). So what’s their other option? They can pay with their stock, but to utilize that option the stock price must be above $359 / share by March. 
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/18/tesla-has-920-million-in-debt-thats-coming-due-could-affect-cash.html

Tesla imo will figure out a way to increase investor confidence regardless of the stock market condition by either having solid figures for their guidance and/or by doing the mode Y reveal in February instead. This will help push the stock price to their desired 359+ mark so it can be used to pay off debt. 

Lastly, the recent layoff report imo is being perceived very wrong. Tesla hired a shit ton of people to make things happen fast but now that the mode 3 line is running they want to get lean and cut off the deadweight. This isn’t a bearish sign but rather bullish from investing standpoint since they’re relying on automation and lean-er manufacturing practices to cut cost. This is something I hope they’ll mention in their earnings call as well. 

I had another point in my head but now I’m distracted so this is all for now. Enjoy ",HorselessHorseman,1548011752,1,110,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ai164m/tesla_deedee_high_tendie_play/

Netflix Just doesn’t make sense,"This irrational ass stock doesn’t make sense.

“The streaming giant said it expected to add 8.9 million paid subscriptions, above a consensus estimate of 8.2 million paid adds.”

“Netflix reported fourth-quarter revenue of $4.19 billion, slightly missing a $4.21 billion consensus estimate,”

It barely beat EPS and while it beat its subscriber growth it wasn’t a substantial amount higher than estimates?Yet it’s already back at its 350 price. it’s increased 30% in the last month? that’s definitely not sustainable. 

For fucks sake it added another 4 billon dollars of debt. 6.5 to 10.4 billion?! I understand the argument that millennials love netflix, But the more I talk around I hear everyone bitch about how either there adding 2 dollars to the subscription or they’re removing all the good shows?  They are paying simply 100 million dollars just to keep Friends on there? Did they do the math that if they got rid of Friends they would lose 100 million dollars worth of revenue?

Here’s my biggest question. Netflix has claimed that it is shooting to have an operating margin of fucking 13% this year. Netflix’s operating margin decreased to 5.2% in the fourth quarter from 7.5% the year before due to “so many titles launching in the quarter”. There business plan is to continue launching original content and spending right? So how the hell are they gonna crank that number up to 13 if the whole reason it decreased this quarter is from producing original content?

$LUV Southwest’s derivatives strategy is purely speculative and wrong.,"I’m not the one who noticed this at all, but rather my derivatives professor. 

From my understanding, airlines can enter positions such as fixed to floating rate swaps, calls, puts and other types of derivatives to hedge. But, the whole point of hedging is not to favor any upside- you should be getting rid of the risk for upside and downside. In their 10K, they explain how they “hedge”.

1. Southwest has purchased 500 million in fixed to floating interest rate swaps and I think it was 650 million in floating to fixed interest rate swaps. That’s the same as having a 150 million position in only floating to fixed swaps. 

2. I haven’t gone back to look at the figures, but in summary they bought calls on jet fuel. That’s not hedging. That’s betting, and we know by looking at a comparable asset (crude heating oil) that they lost tons of money in 2018 due to falling oil prices.  

TL;DR I’m too young and naive to articulate this well, but Southwest’s head of derivates may actually be u/1R0NYMAN given last year’s 10K strategy on derivatives. ",SirWinacus,1547820030,1,5,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ahapgl/luv_southwests_derivatives_strategy_is_purely/
Why Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) should acquire Portola Pharmaceuticals (PTLA) - POTENTIAL BIOTECH M&amp;A,"**5 January 2019 (reposting)**

  
JNJ has $16 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Q318 and an additional $3.3 billion in marketable securities with net cash flows from operations of about $4 billion a quarter. Their total debt is $31 billion.

Under Janssen, they co-promote IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) with AbbVie (Pharmacyclics) which is turning out to be one of the best selling drugs in oncology. It represents the largest drug in JNJ’s oncology portfolio. Sales are growing and over a dozen clinical trials are in JNJ’s pipeline for additional indications. Within the ibrutinib pipeline on JNJ’s side are around 10 combination therapy trials, including those with rituximab and venetoclax. JNJ recorded over $700 M in worldwide sales of ibrutinib last quarter and its partner, AbbVie, recorded $972 M.

Xarelto (rivaroxaban) represents the largest drug in JNJ's cardiovascular/metabolism portfolio, with sales over $600 M last quarter in the US. Xarelto was developed in partnership and is marketed ex-USA by Bayer, and ex-USA revenues were around $1 billion last quarter. The number of lawsuits in regards to Xarelto continues to increase over claims in relation to bleeding. JNJ and Bayer recently said on the matter “…Plaintiffs continue to file 400-600 cases per month when they have no viable liability theory. It’s a never-ending cycle that needs to be stopped.” (reproduced from Forbes article “Unbeaten At Trial, Bayer and Janssen Say Cycle Of Xarelto Lawsuits 'Needs To Be Stopped’”, John O’Brien, June 2018). Supporting this additionally, from JNJ’s Q318 10-Q filing, “…The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase…”

Over the last few years, Xarelto has lost extensive market share to Eliquis (apixaban), likely due to its perceived higher bleeding rates. While there have been no head to head clinical trials against apixaban, in-trial comparisons to warfarin have favored Eliquis with lower bleeding rates, and it nonetheless continues to gain share over Xarelto. Last month, JNJ filed an sNDA for Xarelto based on the MARINER and MAGELLAN trials, for extended prophylaxis of VTE in acute medically ill patients, an area with high discussion in the medical community. When asked about this in a Q&amp;A (Credit Suisse), John Curnutte, Executive VP of R&amp;D at Portola, said, “JNJ is taking a shot”, that they have invested a lot into the program between MARINER and MAGELLAN “so they may as well try…but we are not so sure they will succeed.” The outcome of the sNDA should be known in the second half of this year and will be critical to determine JNJ’s path forward.

Portola has three drugs in the clinic, and no other company can extract better value from all three of these than JNJ.

1. **BEVYXXA**  
JNJ has a big hand in the NOAC space, and Bevyxxa (betrixaban) has the label JNJ is looking for. With JNJ's leadership in this space, I believe their expertise would be highly favorable in commercialising Bevyxxa. More science and more education is key to change the treatment paradigm, as would be essential to penetrate this market.   

2. **ANDEXXA**   
Andexxa (andexanet alfa) can treat life-threatening bleeds associated with Xarelto (as well as Eliquis). Once again, their expertise in the field would be exceptionally useful in distributing the drug to hospitals all over the US. I am sure they have analytics of substantial value from Xarelto's commercialisation and their presence in the space is significant to succeed in commercialising Andexxa. Acquiring Andexxa would also present JNJ with a valuable opportunity to further advance their partnership with Bayer by licensing ex-USA rights to them, where Bayer will have significant advantage in commercialising Andexxa there. They will also mitigate their risk in this way and reduce the internal cost of the buyout if for some reason Andexxa is rejected by the medical community and has poor uptake. While Bayer could also acquire PTLA and cut a partnership deal with JNJ on Andexxa, the total value that can be created from PTLA's assets as a whole would not be as optimal as by a JNJ buyout.  

3. **CERDULATINIB**  
There is a large interest in dealing with ibrutinib-resistant CLL or CLL that has become refractory to ibrutinib. Preclinical work has shown cerdulatinib to induce apoptosis in CLL cells that are ibrutinib-resistant. It inhibits IL-4 signalling in vitro, which may protect CLL cells from ibrutinib-mediated apoptosis. For the science-minded, read published papers: *""Dual SYK/JAK inhibition overcomes ibrutinib resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Cerdulatinib, but not ibrutinib, induces apoptosis of tumor cells protected by the microenvironment.""* and *""The Dual Syk/JAK inhibitor Cerdulatinib Antagonizes B-cell Receptor and Microenvironmental Signaling in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.""* While cerdulatinib was most recently highlighted with impressive responses rates in r/r PTCL and CTCL (ASH 2018), there remains great potential in treating B cell cancers. Partial responses have been seen in an ibrutinib-relapsed FL patient, and a venetoclax-relapsed SLL patient in the recent Phase 2 trial. Portola is seeking to develop an accelerated approval pathway in certain kinds of tumour subtypes. The company has also expressed interest in finding a partner for cerdulatinib.  
I believe ibrutinib, venetoclax and cerdulatinib triple/dual combinations could be paradigm shifting and may produce unprecedented results in certain types of B cell cancers. Each drug counteracts a dysregulated pathway essential to cancer cell survival/proliferation. These possible combinations can be done most efficiently in the framework of the existing JNJ/AbbVie partnership. If cerdulatinib is successful in these combinations, it would boost both companies' top line revenues. Hence, acquiring cerdulatinib can be beneficial to the IMBRUVICA franchise and would allow JNJ to extend its partnership with AbbVie. The JNJ/AbbVie partnership will also mitigate JNJ's risk if for some reason cerdulatinib or a cerdulatinib-consisting combination fails to get approval. Regardless, the choice to take cerdulatinib into combinations with ibrutinib or venetoclax, or both, would be at the order of the owner/s. If JNJ does not acquire PTLA, an AbbVie acquisition is the only other option to get this done efficiently. However, AbbVie has no presence in the cardiovascular space, and whether the company can create added value from Andexxa and Bevyxxa is uncertain. It is certainly not as optimal in synergy as a JNJ acquisition. It should also be noted that JNJ is in charge of Imbruvica in FL (which cerdulatinib has had great data in so far), while AbbVie is in charge of Imbruvica in CLL and DLBCL. 

In the JNJ Q2 conference call, CEO Alex Gorsky said in response (albeit in relation to medical device acquisitions), ""...I won't comment specifically on exactly what size or obviously what companies, but when we think that the strategy is right, that it fits with our portfolio, that we feel that ultimately we can actually create value, based upon the asset and operationalize it and execute, we are ready to do so."" I believe Portola's assets fit perfectly into JNJ's pharmaceutical portfolio. No other company can create as much value from these assets as JNJ can. 

PTLA has an EV of \~$1.1 billion as of 5th January 2019. I predict PTLA's stock price will generally rise for the next several months on outperforming Andexxa sales from the current price of $19.38 to potentially around $35-40. Upside includes Andexxa (Ondexxa) approval by the EMA (Q219) and favorable discussions with the FDA on cerdulatinib (Q119). When the FDA answers to the Xarelto sNDA (\~Q319), PTLA's MC could be around $2.5-3.2 billion ($38-49 a share). A buyout premium of 50%, which may be more favorable to JNJ than PTLA at that time, gives a buyout price per share of $57-74 (or a MC of $3.7-5 billion). Obviously, a lot of things could go wrong over the next few months to rule this out. There are obviously a lot of risks here and I do not recommend purchasing or holding shares solely on the basis of a potential buyout, but I believe these two companies need to talk M&amp;A, if they are not already. Besides this, I believe there are many other positive drivers for PTLA and I have omitted detailed valuation of the company's assets - do your own due diligence.

Short and long thesis on Netflix?,"I love Netflix. Great company and great growth!

BUT... They are valued at $150billion with revenue of less than $15 bill.

The positive is that they reinvest a lot of their revenue into expansion and original content, but is this enough?

They increased their prices by $2 for their 58 million US users, let's assume they are super loyal for now and say this will cause *0 cancellations*.

Now let's continue with a super optimistic (completely unrealistic) assumption on user growth of 50%... And for simplicity let's assume they get those users TODAY.

That means around 200mil global users, with 85mil of those in the US.

That's an extra ~5bil from outside the US, and an extra ~4bil from the us. Plus the price increase will be negligible, and we already over estimated growth, so let's ignore that.

That's 24bil in revenue now. Assuming they keep the same spending on growth and content (again, unrealistic)

That's an earnings of ~10bil. Putting them at 15 P/E ASSUMING THE SP won't change.


I feel that there is 0 possiblility of this happening.

The real numbers: Netflix in Q3 had an amazing 7mil added users. Let's say they can add 30mil in 2019, that MIGHT translates to a very approximate 19bil in rev.

Again let's wrongly assume no change in expenses, that's 6bil in earnings.

Giving them a P/E of 25.

...

So in conclusion, even in the most (imo) unrealistically optimistic growth estimates, AND assuming their SP does not go up. They will have a mediocre (average) PE for a tech company, which isn't really that attractive.


...

So to all the Netflix investors out there... 

1) Am I missing something?

2) Are my napkin calcs wrong?

Netflix is going to but disney in 10 years,"streaming video over tcp/ip is hard, netflix makes it look easy. 
streaming 4k video around the world is basically science fiction, netflix made some incredible technological breakthroughs, a small example from 3 years ago $NFLX accounts for a large percentage of Amazon AWS profit, that’s how much computing power they need in order to stream when porn ends. 

disney on the other hand are a bunch of scrooge mcduck style pedophiles. do you think they will let you share your disney+ login with your friends and family? no way. 
streaming movies isn’t a side business it’s a full time job and disney is too big and heavy to pivot in that direction.

I have been a peeping member of this sub for quite some time. I have donated my share of money to the #RopeFund and experienced the ecstasy of making $3.

&amp;#x200B;

And whether I am up or down, or just decided to keep my bat and ball at home and not play today I really enjoy the actual news you can glimpse in this sub. But it is sometimes hard to find or easy to miss between the works of art style meme's and the well written suicide pacts some of you make.

&amp;#x200B;

The sub is still a three time a day stop for me, but during my morning shits I read a little email i get everyday called ""The Morning Brew"". It is a fantastic little news letter that covers some major topics, some smaller ones, and some things that may have not been on my radar. And sometimes they make a story before this sub has a chance to.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently they are giving away two MacBook Pro's to 2 people, one to a current member and some one they referred. That could me and you. (Did you think I was just giving away a link to a good newsletter?)

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is my promise to the glory that is this melting pot of intelligence, intellect, and poor decision making.

&amp;#x200B;

If I win one, I will sell it, and I will put that money into the mix and document every glorious moment of its existence.

So either all ships has to change to a new fuel with less sulphur content, which is gonna be more expensive and since everyone needs it at once, demand will skyrocket and it will be alot more expensive. Its harder to refine etc. But golden ocean already upgraded all their ship with new cleaning systems, so they can keep using the same cheap fuel",Benouamatis,1547504394,1,9,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ag16yz/golden_ocean_group_limited_gogl/

Preliminary Data Validation Report (Week Ending) 1/11/2019,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Today I finished my first edition of my hypothesis validation script. The spreadsheet it produced can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hb5hQADBx2JOVHiLJvwrBfzxAWwByQenq5lOY\_MkVeA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hb5hQADBx2JOVHiLJvwrBfzxAWwByQenq5lOY_MkVeA/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

The workbook has 4 pages, each summarizing the performance of stocks that were selected by the criteria that determines the highlighted option trades in my daily and weekly reports.

The performance of the stock is measured from its close on the day the option was trades to its current price.

I included Thursday's action in this report, but I think Wednesday will be the last day to be included in these weekly validation reports, with Thursday's action being the first day in the following week's report.

&amp;#x200B;

The weighted average is based on total money traded on the option.

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy with the results of the report, as stocks with unusual call activity consistently outperformed the SPY ETF.

As for stocks with unusual put activity, I think a larger percentage of those trades could be hedges for other positions, so I am not too concerned about the performance of those stocks. My main focus will be on the stocks with unusual call activity.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously this strategy is not perfect, as is shown by some major loses realized by individual stocks on the call side, but I think you can have success with a trading strategy that uses some risk management. I might be speaking too soon here, it will be interesting to see what future data shows us.

And if risk management is not your thing, than feel free to YOLO your life's savings on these trades (just don't blame me please).

&amp;#x200B;

I will probably make additions to this validation script to include the performance of stocks with high CVPV and CMPM ratio, so look for that in the future.

Page 4 contains Highlighted Option Trades. This is the addition I am most excited about. The parameters for a trade making it on this list are as follows: Total trade value must be equal to or over $500,000, and the trade must compose more than 2/3 of the total monetary value of options trade for a given stock. I think I am going to look to this list for most of my trades, and I will definitely be using this list for hypothesis validation (which is coming out later this weekend).

Page 5 is just contains all unusual option activity for every stock. Sorted in alphabetical order.

I have added WA Put Strikes and WA Call Strike columns. These are the weighted average (with respect to volume of the trade) of the strike prices of the calls or puts for a given expiration date. This is meant to give you an idea of why type of options are being purchased (itm, atm, otm).

Unusual Option Activity 1/10/2019 (Major Methodology Change),"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for posting this spreadsheet a little later than normal, but I have been making some major changes to the script/spreadsheet.

&amp;#x200B;

Today's spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W7dmuiOC-txw-HYmqFb9poFncPC-e459ujOoRakwbmE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W7dmuiOC-txw-HYmqFb9poFncPC-e459ujOoRakwbmE/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

Changes: 

I no longer use a weighted average of the otm options to calculate a predicted price for any given stock. Instead, this spreadsheet uses the break even price of ALL Options Trades in the weighted average value for the projected stock price. I think this is a better method because it includes all option activity for the stock on any given day.

&amp;#x200B;

The workbook now has 4 pages:

Page 1: Sorted by percent change between the current stock price and the predicted price.

Page 2: Sorted by the most total money traded for a single expiration date for a given stock.

Page 3: Raw data for filters.

Page 4: Individual option trades for stocks sorted alphabetically.

&amp;#x200B;

Dollar signs ($) were added before tickers to make using **ctrl + f** easier.

&amp;#x200B;

CVPV and CMPM Ratios were added next to the stock ticker on pages 1 and 2.

CVPV = Call Volume / Put Volume

CMPM = Call Money / Put Money

&amp;#x200B;

Unusual Options Activity 1/9/2019 (and a correction of past days),"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Today's Spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VWZtgz5UHPPoVt501ZH-Bx4anvStwVRT5mFikPPto6E/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VWZtgz5UHPPoVt501ZH-Bx4anvStwVRT5mFikPPto6E/edit?usp=sharing)

What is new: I added a total number of option trades column, along with columns that specify the number of calls and puts for a specific expiration date.

&amp;#x200B;

 There are three spreadsheets included in the workbook. The first sorts all tickers based on the largest percent change, the second by the total money traded on any one expiration date, and the third is just the raw data with filters for those of you who wanted that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Methodology: The predicted price found in the spreadsheet is a weighted average of the strike price and volume of an otm option trade. I decided to only pick otm options because I think that they act as a prediction for where the stock price is going. Itm options would affect the weighted average in a manner which is counter intuitive to their nature. For example, someone who buys an itm call expects the stock price to increase, yet adding their call to the weighted average would bring it down.

&amp;#x200B;

To find data on a specific company, use ctrl + f.

&amp;#x200B;

MINOR BUG IN PREVIOUS SPREADSHEETS: Due to the way data is extracted from csv. files, I was accidentally using string comparison instead of floating point comparison. The only way this would produce and error is if the strike price was a whole digit larger or smaller.

&amp;#x200B;

Example: 12 &gt; 2 but '12' &lt; '2'

Biotech ready for Blast-off $SGMO,"2 Words- Sangamo Therapudics $SGMO


Recently have been on a rollercoaster ride up and down between $9 and $14 a share.   This company has 0 debt, and have finished their acquisition of TXCell in December. They look to start using their equity to reinvest into R&amp;D. This company is poised to take a rocket ship to Mars when their new gene therapy study results come back showing positive. 


Today they dropped over 14% at the end of the day. This could be some shareholder dumping their stock at a recent high to buy back in at a lower price. Typically this stock moves 200,000 shares up and down. Today they sold over 500,000 at 3:50-4:00PM. I think now is a good time to jump on board before this thing takes off to the moon.

Methodology: The predicted price found in the spreadsheet is a weighted average of the strike price and volume of an otm option trade. I decided to only pick otm options because I think that they act as a prediction for where the stock price is going. Itm options would affect the weighted average in a manner which is counter intuitive to their nature. For example, someone who buys an itm call expects the stock price to increase, yet adding their call to the weighted average would bring it down.

Reflecting on my recent PC Build,"I recently built a mid-tier ~$1100 PC for gaming/workstation. I knew very little going into this process but over 3 weeks I did dozens of hours of research before I finally ordered all the components. From a consumers perspective I think there might be some trends developing in the industry in general that may or may not be able to be capitalized on by a retail investor.

1. AMD dominates Intel in everything but high end builds where price is not a concern. I went with a R5 2600. 

2. I went with a MSI X470 MB that supports AM4 crossfire for future system upgradability. Paired it with a RX 580. Again AMD dominates Nvidia in everything but high end builds where price is not a concern. Generally Radeon cards are very close to GTX cards of the same tier while being 10-30% cheaper. The Radeon drivers vs GTX in my opinion are nicer to deal with. Addition costs are associated with Gaming desktop screens relating to Nvidia vs Radeon that give AMD another cost advantage. When I need to upgrade my system in the future another RX 580 will work nicely with AMD’s crossfire.

3. Lastly storage. In my opinion HDD is losing market share to SSD for general data storage. SSD prices are falling and the other benefits vs HDD made me willing to go with a full SSD storage build of 1TB despite the extra cost. Micron and other SSD manufacturers will benefit from the general switch from SSD to HDD that is starting.

Other system specs.
16 GB ram
600W power supply
Fan cpu cooler
Some RGB fans cause I’m a fag
Corsair case cause they are nice/cheap

"Long FB, the God of Virtual Reality","I think that the fact that:

People have to invest in a particular brand app store will make the products very sticky. ( Not going to buy a HTC Shadow 2 over an Oculus Quest 2, when the Oculus Quest 2 can play my $1000+ Oculus Quest 1 library,  and the Shadow can't)

The price of HMDs will make it unlikely that most  people will purchase more than one

There should be a limited amount of platforms that recieve developer attention, based on the number of users on the platforms. Both the number and quality of apps will fall into a liminted number of ecosystems at best.

Will limit the amount of app stores that can be successful, much like the smart phone, or gaming console market today. I see little competition for FB outside of Sony (and Sony competes only in the demographic that has Playstations) in near term VR. I don't see Valve as a serious long term competitor, but if they are it will be in high end PC VR, which is a small niche market. I see VR developing into a market with very little competition amongst a few app ecosystems. 

Facebook/Oculus is years ahead on research over the competition, creating better products, at cheaper prices, and with better marketing. This will allow them to capture market share, and lock consumers in early on. Margins in this business will be sustainably high, as evident in Android or Apple app stores. VR will be a high growth market for years to come, and FB also has strong chances to become a major player in AR.

Short $SWKS (Apple supplier),"Sup nerds, long time no see. After losing 18k last year, I put in $350 in my RH account last week to play with all the crazy news coming out recently. Short $SWKS:

1. Apple lowered guidance yesterday, cutting growth for the first time ever and citing weak sales in China. Also there is economic slowdown in China, and this whole trade war thing is really fucking Chinese companies.

2. Shorting APPL is dumb. Everybody and their mother saw last nights news and the dip, and is thinking to short APPL. But APPL is still a good business and Buffet wants to buy more. I think it’s dip will be smaller. So how can you profit off of this news? Short Apple’s suppliers.

3. Here are a few of Apples suppliers: $SWKS $TSM $QRVO. In a mad frenzy I researched the shit out of these companies last night. All of them get a ton of business from Apple - you can look up the exact numbers but it was something like 40%, 30%, 20% respectively.

4. Apple suppliers are getting fucked from lowering smartphone sales. All of those companies are down over 10% in the past month and some are down much more.

5. Why $SWKS? [Skyworks gets 40% of its business from Apple.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2017/09/18/how-skyworks-solutions-makes-most-of-its-money.aspx) That’s a huge amount - even more than the other suppliers. Analysts with a sell rating cite the risks of how much the company relies on Apple. Also, I was looking through posts in this sub and came across [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9e5ufu/thinking_about_swks_puts/?st=JQGQV8BS&amp;sh=781c505b) 86% of Skyworks’ revenue is from China. This was the number one company on this trade war short list, and the fact that smartphone sales/Apple sales in China are dipping will kill the company’s prospects.

6. I’m all in on $SWKS cause I have no money in my RH account after losing everything last year. I was planning to diversify among the 3 suppliers I picked but as soon as the markets opened all of the contracts I was looking at doubled in price. My plan was that if I couldn’t afford contracts on each ticker, SWKS was the one I’d go all in on. [I have 2 contracts expiring this month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9e5ufu/thinking_about_swks_puts/?st=JQGQV8BS&amp;sh=781c505b)

Is it too late to get in on this play? Well, $SWKS is already down 7% as I’m writing this with the other tickers not looking so hot either. I’m up 50% in 30 minutes on my positions. I think that these have a ways to continue down, but to be safe I would buy puts that expire in feburary (i.e. this might bounce back in the short term but I believe they will continue to drop at least for the next few months). Another risk is that China and the US come to some agreement that helps these stocks. I think it is very unlikely to happen, at least for a month or two as Trump battles the democrats and the incoming gridlock in congress. He is unpredictable but I don’t think he is smart enough to deal with China while whining about border funding. Also - Apple is being boycotted in China because of the Huawei executive arrest. Even if the trade war is resolved I think Apple is screwed in China for the forseeable future.",bumkin123,1546528750,1,24,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ac6md8/short_swks_apple_supplier/

Why Apple's guidance revision was a brilliant move,"Brilliant move for everyone except swing traders. Apple likely still has approved buybacks that they need to complete for this quarter, so why not take advantage of the uncertainty looming over the markets to price in an earnings miss and get cheaper shares?

Apple benefits not only economically, but also on the PR side. This makes Cook look transparent and honest, which is a plus for shareholders.

ALKON THE FALCON 2: THE BIG LONG,"# [TL;DR (with sound)](https://streamable.com/4rq91)

&amp;#x200B;

***Aw fuck, not this guy again.***

&amp;#x200B;

That's right, you giant buttfuck. You better sit your ravaged buttcheeks down for this one, because I'm about to save your sorry ass from this pathetic bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, the stock price has collapsed. Volume has collapsed. The company damn near ran out of cash and...

[*...it's about to make biotech executives explode fucking diarrhea all over themselves.*](https://i.imgur.com/nmYoq7R.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

***Yeah, right.***

&amp;#x200B;

[Remember this scene from the Big Short?](https://youtu.be/SQTbbUASPLQ)

In this scene, we see how our protagonists holding swaps should technically have huge profits due to all the collapsing CDOs, but since the big banks refuse to correctly value their swaps, they're still left with nothing.

If you take a look at Neurotrope, it's in a similar seat. The last trial (especially the ad-hoc analysis) showed results that have **never** been seen before in the history of Alzheimer's, and yet Big Pharma &amp; media keep sweeping it under the rug and are instead focusing on literally every other biopharma out there.

The market doesn't give a single shit about this company, and yet it's about to announce results in a couple of months that could cause several major players in the industry to shit their pants in collective terror as they realize that they dumped (and are still dumping) billions of dollars into the wrong Alzheimer's theory.

And not only is the biotech industry in denial, [but there are also researchers out there being denied research funds for simply wanting to try a different approach to AD](https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/29/alzheimers-research-outsider-bucked-prevailing-theory/), rather than the same old horseshit that the industry has been beating to death for decades.

Then again, why wouldn't they wanna keep this quiet?

Imagine how many researchers are going to lose their jobs once their boss finds out they're working on a drug that does jack shit (Just watch as Biogen's aducanumab trial drops dead in 2020 and their stock fucking tanks).

[That's why this is such a huge opportunity.](https://i.lensdump.com/i/Av10Do.png)

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you that aren't completely braindead and want to read the papers that prove this shit works, here's the link:

[https://justpaste.it/4frnd](https://justpaste.it/4frnd)

If you are too stupid to read research articles you should at least read the abstracts, or even just the titles, and if you can't even do that you should honestly just kill yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, treating AD is big news on its own, but that's not what makes this the greatest opportunity I have ever seen.

If you read the research papers, you can see that the drug works by repairing the wiring in the brain using a pathway that's **already inside the brain.**

In other words, this isn't some miracle cure that fixes everything through magic. It just activates the repair system we already have inside our brains.

&amp;#x200B;

***And why is this relevant?***

&amp;#x200B;

It's relevant because it possibly means that this isn't just an AD drug, but a drug for repairing brain damage in general.

The company isn't officially talking about all these indications yet, but if you take a look at their [massive fucking patent portfolio](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/daniel-l-alkon), you can see that they eventually want to use this thing to treat:

*- Alzheimer's Disease*

*- Fragile X*

*- Niemann-Pick C*

*- Synaptic damage/Synaptic loss*

*- Stroke*

*- Mental retardation*

*- Autism*

*- Parkinson's Disease*

*- Dementia*

*- Parkinson's dementia*

*- Frontotemporal dementia*

*- Vascular dementia*

*- Depression*

*- Bipolar disorder*

*- Schizophrenia*

*- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder*

*- Brain injury*

*- Traumatic brain injury*

*- Brain injury induced by irradiation*

*- Rett Syndrome*

*- Lewy body dementia*

*- Chronic traumatic encephalopathy*

*- Multiple Sclerosis*

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and did I mention that they have an exclusive license with the only entity in the world that can synthesize this drug? Meaning that no one else can treat neurological disorders with it?

&amp;#x200B;

***That's impossible. You're stupid. Fuck this scam. Fuck you.***

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, the FDA has already granted the company an Orphan Drug Designation for treating Fragile X.

Second of all, [Dr. Alkon invented an AD test so accurate, it was given a Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurodiagnostics-llc-new-alzheimers-assay-granted-breakthrough-device-designation-by-us-food-and-drug-administration-300731304.html)

And if you still don't believe me, **read the goddamn papers** and see the proof for yourself. They are all peer reviewed and published in highly respected scientific journals. This isn't some kiddie land bullshit we're talking about.

Fuck, just read the abstract of this paper about multiple sclerosis: [https://www.scribd.com/document/386853846/Bryostatin-1-alleviates-experimental-multiple-sclerosis](https://www.scribd.com/document/386853846/Bryostatin-1-alleviates-experimental-multiple-sclerosis)

Even some random scientists that have nothing to do with the company independently proved that this thing works for MS too.

&amp;#x200B;

***Alright, so if this thing really works, why are you posting this now when the current trial won't finish until July?***

&amp;#x200B;

Because once you hear about it in the news, it's already too late.

&amp;#x200B;

I was too slow with [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/627c8w/dd_alkon_the_falcon_a_tale_of_big_brainz_50000/), but since people misunderstood the results and ran away like a bunch of pussies I can now be early enough with a second post.  That means you now have plenty of time to pick your nose and slap your nuts while you decide if this is worth your time or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this time around there won't be any patients on Memantine to fuck up the results like they did last time.

&amp;#x200B;

***What's the deal with Memantine?***

&amp;#x200B;

To keep it simple, Memantine blocks the NMDA receptor in your brain. Don't worry about what that is. The important part is that by doing so it blocks the effects of Bryostatin.

&amp;#x200B;

To show what an impact it had on patients, here's the results that were presented in 2017 with all patients included:

[https://i.lensdump.com/i/AnbOrP.jpg](https://i.lensdump.com/i/AnbOrP.jpg)

Look at how much the SIB scores improve once you remove patients on Memantine.

&amp;#x200B;

***Wait, what the fuck is an SIB?***

&amp;#x200B;

The SIB scale is a scale for moderate-severe AD patients that basically measures how retarded you are. The higher your score, the less retarded you are. The scale goes to 100 and once you hit max, you're no longer considered to have moderate-severe AD (I never studied neuroscience though so don't quote me on this).

Mild AD patients use the MMSE scale, but that's not relevant here since this was a trial for moderate-severe patients. The drug is however expected to work in patients with all stages of AD due to its MOA.

Here's a shitty picture that hopefully makes the scales easier to understand and compare:

[https://i.imgur.com/s61opUd.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/s61opUd.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Patients in this trial started with SIB scores around 80, and patients in the 20 dose bryo group had a mean SIB change of +6.7 after 11 weeks of treatment and 30 days of just waiting around and watching patients improve even after dosing had stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

***I don't know what the fuck you just wrote, but okay, the science seems solid. What about all these warrants though?***

&amp;#x200B;

Like with most things that sound too good to be true, this too has a catch. In this case it's the shitfuck ton of warrants.

If they're all exercised, they will bring in almost $100 million for the company, which should be more than enough to get their drug onto the market and start generating revenues, which means no more significant dilution since they don't need to raise more cash.

As of today, the fully diluted share count is at around 25 million, but let's raise it to 30 million instead because fuck you.

Even with a potential 30 million outstanding shares, this thing is still incredibly undervalued. Here's why:

[Back in July, Biogen &amp; Eisai made an announcement that they had positive results for their AD trial. Soon after, investors added $20 billion to their market caps in total.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/25/biogen-and-eisai-unveil-ban2401-alzheimers-disease-trial-results.html)

Yes, the results eventually turned out to be shit and the market cap gains disappeared soon after, but I want you to focus on how investors reacted to the positive news.

Now first of all, Biogen's drug was only expected to slow the decline of patients and not actually treat them.

Second of all, their drug was only meant to delay mild AD rather than treat brain damage in general, but hey, fuck it. Let's use $20 billion as our starting point anyways.

In that case, a successful trial would make Neurotrope worth **AT LEAST** $667 per share (20 billion divided by 30 million).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not even gonna bother looking up how many people are affected by the neurodegenerative disorders I mentioned above, but if we stick to just Alzheimer's, we can safely assume at least 10 million people will be needing this drug every year to not fucking die. There's about 50 million people around the world living with dementia today, and about 300 million are suffering from depression, but whatever, let's continue.

Let's say the drug sells for $500/month and Neurotrope gets 30% from royalties. Actually, let's drop it to 20% because go fuck yourself. That's still $100 in profits per patient each month, or $1200 per year for each patient.

Multiply $1200/year by 10 million patients and you get a company generating $12 billion in yearly profits.

Slap a P/E ratio of 15 on top of that, and you have a company worth $180 billion, or about $6000 per share.

For reference, that would give you a 150,000% profit if you bought in at $4 (Right now it's trading at $3.65).

And since this stock is so thinly traded, even a monkey fucking a banana in Cambodia can move this thing over 20% in a day.

&amp;#x200B;

***So what's your point with all this?***

***Aw fuck, not this guy again.***

&amp;#x200B;

That's right, you dildonic buttfuck. You better sit your ravaged buttcheeks down for this one, because I'm about to save your sorry ass from this pathetic bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, the stock price has collapsed. Volume has collapsed. The company damn near ran out of cash and...

[*...it's about to make biotech executives explode fucking diarrhea all over themselves.*](https://i.imgur.com/nmYoq7R.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

***Yeah, right.***

&amp;#x200B;

[Remember this scene from the Big Short?](https://youtu.be/SQTbbUASPLQ)

In this scene, we see how our protagonists holding swaps should technically have huge profits due to all the collapsing CDOs, but since the big banks refuse to correctly value their swaps, they're still left with nothing.

If you take a look at Neurotrope, it's in a similar seat. The last trial (especially the ad-hoc analysis) showed results that have **never** been seen before in the history of Alzheimer's, and yet Big Pharma &amp; media keep sweeping it under the rug and are instead focusing on literally every other biopharma out there.

The market doesn't give a single shit about this company, and yet it's about to announce results in a couple of months that could cause several major players in the industry to shit their pants in collective terror as they realize that they dumped (and are still dumping) billions of dollars into the wrong Alzheimer's theory.

And not only is the biotech industry in denial, [but there are also researchers out there being denied research funds for simply wanting to try a different approach to AD](https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/29/alzheimers-research-outsider-bucked-prevailing-theory/), rather than the same old horseshit that the industry has been beating to death for decades.

Then again, why wouldn't they wanna keep this quiet?

Imagine how many researchers are going to lose their jobs once their boss finds out they're working on a drug that does jack shit (Just watch as Biogen's aducanumab trial drops dead in 2020 and their stock fucking tanks).

[That's why this is such a huge opportunity.](https://i.lensdump.com/i/Av10Do.png)

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you that aren't completely braindead and want to read the papers that prove this shit works, here's the link:

[https://justpaste.it/4frnd](https://justpaste.it/4frnd)

If you are too stupid to read research articles you should at least read the abstracts, or even just the titles, and if you can't even do that you should honestly just kill yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, treating AD is big news on its own, but that's not what makes this the greatest opportunity I have ever seen.

If you read the research papers, you can see that the drug works by repairing the wiring in the brain using a pathway that's **already inside the brain.**

In other words, this isn't some miracle cure that fixes everything through magic. It just activates the repair system we already have inside our brains.

&amp;#x200B;

***And why is this relevant?***

&amp;#x200B;

It's relevant because it possibly means that this isn't just an AD drug, but a drug for repairing brain damage in general.

The company isn't officially talking about all these indications yet, but if you take a look at their [massive fucking patent portfolio](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/daniel-l-alkon), you can see that they eventually want to use this thing to treat:

*- Alzheimer's Disease*

*- Fragile X*

*- Niemann-Pick C*

*- Synaptic damage/Synaptic loss*

*- Stroke*

*- Mental retardation*

*- Autism*

*- Brain injury induced by irradiation*

*- Rett Syndrome*

*- Lewy body dementia*

*- Chronic traumatic encephalopathy*

*- Multiple Sclerosis*

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and did I mention that they have an exclusive license with the only entity in the world that can synthesize this drug? Meaning that no one else can treat neurological disorders with it?

&amp;#x200B;

***That's impossible. You're stupid. Fuck this scam. Fuck you.***

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, the FDA has already granted the company an Orphan Drug Designation for treating Fragile X.

Second of all, [Dr. Alkon invented an AD test so accurate, it was given a Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurodiagnostics-llc-new-alzheimers-assay-granted-breakthrough-device-designation-by-us-food-and-drug-administration-300731304.html)

And if you still don't believe me, **read the goddamn papers** and see the proof for yourself. They are all peer reviewed and published in highly respected scientific journals. This isn't some kiddie land bullshit we're talking about.

Fuck, just read the abstract of this paper about multiple sclerosis: [https://www.scribd.com/document/386853846/Bryostatin-1-alleviates-experimental-multiple-sclerosis](https://www.scribd.com/document/386853846/Bryostatin-1-alleviates-experimental-multiple-sclerosis)

Even some random scientists that have nothing to do with the company independently proved that this thing works for MS too.

&amp;#x200B;

***Alright, so if this thing really works, why are you posting this now when the current trial won't finish until July?***

&amp;#x200B;

Because once you hear about it in the news, it's already too late.

&amp;#x200B;

I was too slow with [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/627c8w/dd_alkon_the_falcon_a_tale_of_big_brainz_50000/), but since people misunderstood the results and ran away like a bunch of pussies I can now be early enough with a second post.  That means you now have plenty of time to pick your nose and slap your nuts while you decide if this is worth your time or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this time around there won't be any patients on Memantine to fuck up the results like they did last time.

&amp;#x200B;

***What's the deal with Memantine?***

&amp;#x200B;

To keep it simple, Memantine blocks the NMDA receptor in your brain. Don't worry about what that is. The important part is that by doing so it blocks the effects of Bryostatin.

&amp;#x200B;

To show what an impact it had on patients, here's the results that were presented in 2017 with all patients included:

[https://i.lensdump.com/i/AnbOrP.jpg](https://i.lensdump.com/i/AnbOrP.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Kinda lame, right? Well here's what those same results look like when you separate the different patient groups:

[https://i.lensdump.com/i/ABRMJD.png](https://i.lensdump.com/i/ABRMJD.png)

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't like charts, here's the raw clinical trial data (Read the part that says ""Post-hoc Outcome""):

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02431468?view=results](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02431468?view=results)

[Back in July, Biogen &amp; Eisai made an announcement that they had positive results for their AD trial. Soon after, investors added $20 billion to their market caps in total.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/25/biogen-and-eisai-unveil-ban2401-alzheimers-disease-trial-results.html)

Yes, the results eventually turned out to be shit and the market cap gains disappeared soon after, but I want you to focus on how investors reacted to the positive news.

Now first of all, Biogen's drug was only expected to slow the decline of patients and not actually treat them.

Second of all, their drug was only meant to delay mild AD rather than treat brain damage in general, but hey, fuck it. Let's use $20 billion as our starting point anyways.

In that case, a successful trial would make Neurotrope worth **AT LEAST** $667 per share (20 billion divided by 30 million).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not even gonna bother looking up how many people are affected by the neurodegenerative disorders I mentioned above, but if we stick to just Alzheimer's, we can safely assume at least 10 million people will be needing this drug every year to not fucking die. There's about 50 million people around the world living with dementia today, and about 300 million are suffering from depression, but whatever, let's continue.

Let's say the drug sells for $500/month and Neurotrope gets 30% from royalties. Actually, let's drop it to 20% because go fuck yourself. That's still $100 in profits per patient each month, or $1200 per year for each patient.

Multiply $1200/year by 10 million patients and you get a company generating $12 billion in yearly profits.

Slap a P/E ratio of 15 on top of that, and you have a company worth $180 billion, or about $6000 per share.

For reference, that would give you a 150,000% profit if you bought in at $4 (Right now it's trading at $3.69).

And since this stock is so thinly traded, even a monkey fucking a banana in Cambodia can move this thing over 20% in a day.

***Aw fuck, not this guy again.***

&amp;#x200B;

That's right, you dildonic buttfuck. You better sit your ravaged buttcheeks down for this one, because I'm about to save your sorry ass from this pathetic bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, the stock price has collapsed. Volume has collapsed. The company damn near ran out of cash and...

[*...it's about to make biotech executives explode fucking diarrhea all over themselves.*](https://i.imgur.com/nmYoq7R.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

***Yeah, right.***

&amp;#x200B;

[Remember this scene from the Big Short?](https://youtu.be/SQTbbUASPLQ)

In this scene, we see how our protagonists holding swaps should technically have huge profits due to all the collapsing CDOs, but since the big banks refuse to correctly value their swaps, they're still left with nothing.

If you take a look at Neurotrope, it's in a similar seat. The last trial (especially the ad-hoc analysis) showed results that have **never** been seen before in the history of Alzheimer's, and yet Big Pharma &amp; media keep sweeping it under the rug and are instead focusing on literally every other biopharma out there.

The market doesn't give a single shit about this company, and yet it's about to announce results in a couple of months that could cause several major players in the industry to shit their pants in collective terror as they realize that they dumped (and are still dumping) billions of dollars into the wrong Alzheimer's theory.

And not only is the biotech industry in denial, [but there are also researchers out there being denied research funds for simply wanting to try a different approach to AD](https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/29/alzheimers-research-outsider-bucked-prevailing-theory/), rather than the same old horseshit that the industry has been beating to death for decades.

Then again, why wouldn't they wanna keep this quiet?

Imagine how many researchers are going to lose their jobs once their boss finds out they're working on a drug that does jack shit (Just watch as Biogen's aducanumab trial drops dead in 2020 and their stock fucking tanks).

[That's why this is such a huge opportunity.](https://i.lensdump.com/i/Av10Do.png)

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you that aren't completely braindead and want to read the papers that prove this shit works, here's the link:

[https://justpaste.it/4frnd](https://justpaste.it/4frnd)

If you are too stupid to read research articles you should at least read the abstracts, or even just the titles, and if you can't even do that you should honestly just kill yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, treating AD is big news on its own, but that's not what makes this the greatest opportunity I have ever seen.

If you read the research papers, you can see that the drug works by repairing the wiring in the brain using a pathway that's **already inside the brain.**

In other words, this isn't some miracle cure that fixes everything through magic. It just activates the repair system we already have inside our brains.

&amp;#x200B;

***And why is this relevant?***

&amp;#x200B;

It's relevant because it possibly means that this isn't just an AD drug, but a drug for repairing brain damage in general.

The company isn't officially talking about all these indications yet, but if you take a look at their [massive fucking patent portfolio](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/daniel-l-alkon), you can see that they eventually want to use this thing to treat:

*- Alzheimer's Disease*

*- Fragile X*

*- Niemann-Pick C*

*- Synaptic damage/Synaptic loss*

*- Stroke*

*- Mental retardation*

*- Autism*

*- Parkinson's Disease*

*- Dementia*

*- Parkinson's dementia*

*- Frontotemporal dementia*

*- Brain injury*

*- Traumatic brain injury*

*- Brain injury induced by irradiation*

*- Rett Syndrome*

*- Lewy body dementia*

*- Chronic traumatic encephalopathy*

*- Multiple Sclerosis*

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and did I mention that they have an exclusive license with the only entity in the world that can synthesize this drug? Meaning that no one else can treat neurological disorders with it?

&amp;#x200B;

***That's impossible. You're stupid. Fuck this scam. Fuck you.***

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, the FDA has already granted the company an Orphan Drug Designation for treating Fragile X.

Second of all, [Dr. Alkon invented an AD test so accurate, it was given a Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurodiagnostics-llc-new-alzheimers-assay-granted-breakthrough-device-designation-by-us-food-and-drug-administration-300731304.html)

And if you still don't believe me, **read the goddamn papers** and see the proof for yourself. They are all peer reviewed and published in highly respected scientific journals. This isn't some kiddie land bullshit we're talking about.

Fuck, just read the abstract of this paper about multiple sclerosis: [https://www.scribd.com/document/386853846/Bryostatin-1-alleviates-experimental-multiple-sclerosis](https://www.scribd.com/document/386853846/Bryostatin-1-alleviates-experimental-multiple-sclerosis)

Even some random scientists that have nothing to do with the company independently proved that this thing works for MS too.

&amp;#x200B;

***Alright, so if this thing really works, why are you posting this now when the current trial won't finish until July?***

&amp;#x200B;

Because once you hear about it in the news, it's already too late.

&amp;#x200B;

I was too slow with [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/627c8w/dd_alkon_the_falcon_a_tale_of_big_brainz_50000/), but since people misunderstood the results and ran away like a bunch of pussies I can now be early enough with a second post.  That means you now have plenty of time to pick your nose and slap your nuts while you decide if this is worth your time or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this time around there won't be any patients on Memantine to fuck up the results like they did last time.

&amp;#x200B;

***What's the deal with Memantine?***

&amp;#x200B;

To keep it simple, Memantine blocks the NMDA receptor in your brain. Don't worry about what that is. The important part is that by doing so it blocks the effects of Bryostatin.

&amp;#x200B;

To show what an impact it had on patients, here's the results that were presented in 2017 with all patients included:

[https://i.lensdump.com/i/AnbOrP.jpg](https://i.lensdump.com/i/AnbOrP.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Kinda lame, right? Well here's what those same results look like when you separate the different patient groups:

[https://i.lensdump.com/i/ABRMJD.png](https://i.lensdump.com/i/ABRMJD.png)

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't like charts, here's the raw clinical trial data (Read the part that says ""Post-hoc Outcome""):

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02431468?view=results](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02431468?view=results)

&amp;#x200B;

Look at how much the SIB scores improve once you remove patients on Memantine.

&amp;#x200B;

***Wait, what the fuck is an SIB?***

&amp;#x200B;

The SIB scale is a scale for moderate-severe AD patients that basically measures how retarded you are. The higher your score, the less retarded you are. The scale goes to 100 and once you hit max, you're no longer considered to have moderate-severe AD (I never studied neuroscience though so don't quote me on this).

Mild AD patients use the MMSE scale, but that's not relevant here since this was a trial for moderate-severe patients. The drug is however expected to work in patients with all stages of AD due to its MOA.

Here's a shitty picture that hopefully makes the scales easier to understand and compare:

[https://i.imgur.com/s61opUd.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/s61opUd.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Patients in this trial started with SIB scores around 80, and patients in the 20 dose bryo group had a mean SIB change of +6.7 after 11 weeks of treatment and 30 days of just waiting around and watching patients improve even after dosing had stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

***I don't know what the fuck you just wrote, but okay, the science seems solid. What about all these warrants though?***

&amp;#x200B;

Like with most things that sound too good to be true, this too has a catch. In this case it's the shitfuck ton of warrants.

If they're all exercised, they will bring in almost $100 million for the company, which should be more than enough to get their drug onto the market and start generating revenues, which means no more significant dilution since they don't need to raise more cash.

As of today, the fully diluted share count is at around 25 million, but let's raise it to 30 million instead because fuck you.

Even with a potential 30 million outstanding shares, this thing is still incredibly undervalued. Here's why:

What you're looking at here could very well be the mother of biotech black swans.

Boys, I present to you the ultimate yolo you've all been waiting for:

ALKON THE FALCON 2: THE BIG LONG,"# [TL;DR (with sound)](https://streamable.com/4rq91)

&amp;#x200B;

***Aw fuck, not this guy again.***

&amp;#x200B;

That's right, you dildonic buttfuck. You better sit your ravaged buttcheeks down for this one, because I'm about to save your sorry ass from this pathetic bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, the stock price has collapsed. Volume has collapsed. The company damn near ran out of cash and...

[*...it's about to make biotech executives explode fucking diarrhea all over themselves.*](https://i.imgur.com/nmYoq7R.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

***Yeah, right.***

&amp;#x200B;

[Remember this scene from the Big Short?](https://youtu.be/SQTbbUASPLQ)

In this scene, we see how our protagonists holding swaps should technically have huge profits due to all the collapsing CDOs, but since the big banks refuse to correctly value their swaps, they're still left with nothing.

If you take a look at Neurotrope, it's in a similar seat. The last trial (especially the ad-hoc analysis) showed results that have **never** been seen before in the history of Alzheimer's, and yet Big Pharma &amp; media keep sweeping it under the rug and are instead focusing on literally every other biopharma out there.

The market doesn't give a single shit about this company, and yet it's about to announce results in a couple of months that could cause several major players in the industry to shit their pants in collective terror as they realize that they dumped (and are still dumping) billions of dollars into the wrong Alzheimer's theory.

And not only is the biotech industry in denial, [but there are also researchers out there being denied research funds for simply wanting to try a different approach to AD](https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/29/alzheimers-research-outsider-bucked-prevailing-theory/), rather than the same old horseshit that the industry has been beating to death for decades.

Then again, why wouldn't they wanna keep this quiet?

Imagine how many researchers are going to lose their jobs once their boss finds out they're working on a drug that does jack shit (Just watch as Biogen's aducanumab trial drops dead in 2020 and their stock fucking tanks).

[That's why this is such a huge opportunity.](https://i.lensdump.com/i/Av10Do.png)

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you that aren't completely braindead and want to read the papers that prove this shit works, here's the link:

[https://justpaste.it/4frnd](https://justpaste.it/4frnd)

If you are too stupid to read research articles you should at least read the abstracts, or even just the titles, and if you can't even do that you should honestly just kill yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, treating AD is big news on its own, but that's not what makes this the greatest opportunity I have ever seen.

If you read the research papers, you can see that the drug works by repairing the wiring in the brain using a pathway that's **already inside the brain.**

In other words, this isn't some miracle cure that fixes everything through magic. It just activates the repair system we already have inside our brains.

&amp;#x200B;

***And why is this relevant?***

&amp;#x200B;

It's relevant because it possibly means that this isn't just an AD drug, but a drug for repairing brain damage in general.

The company isn't officially talking about all these indications yet, but if you take a look at their [massive fucking patent portfolio](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/daniel-l-alkon), you can see that they eventually want to use this thing to treat:

*- Alzheimer's Disease*

*- Fragile X*

*- Niemann-Pick C*

*- Synaptic damage/Synaptic loss*

*- Stroke*

*- Mental retardation*

*- Autism*

*- Parkinson's Disease*

*- Dementia*

*- Parkinson's dementia*

*- Frontotemporal dementia*

*- Vascular dementia*

*- Depression*

*- Bipolar disorder*

*- Schizophrenia*

*- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder*

*- Brain injury*

*- Traumatic brain injury*

*- Brain injury induced by irradiation*

*- Rett Syndrome*

*- Lewy body dementia*

*- Chronic traumatic encephalopathy*

*- Multiple Sclerosis*

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and did I mention that they have an exclusive license with the only entity in the world that can synthesize this drug? Meaning that no one else can treat neurological disorders with it?

&amp;#x200B;

***That's impossible. You're stupid. Fuck this scam. Fuck you.***

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, the FDA has already granted the company an Orphan Drug Designation for treating Fragile X.

Second of all, [Dr. Alkon invented an AD test so accurate, it was given a Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurodiagnostics-llc-new-alzheimers-assay-granted-breakthrough-device-designation-by-us-food-and-drug-administration-300731304.html)

And if you still don't believe me, **read the goddamn papers** and see the proof for yourself. They are all peer reviewed and published in highly respected scientific journals. This isn't some kiddie land bullshit we're talking about.

Fuck, just read the abstract of this paper about multiple sclerosis: [https://www.scribd.com/document/386853846/Bryostatin-1-alleviates-experimental-multiple-sclerosis](https://www.scribd.com/document/386853846/Bryostatin-1-alleviates-experimental-multiple-sclerosis)

Even some random scientists that have nothing to do with the company independently proved that this thing works for MS too.

&amp;#x200B;

***Alright, so if this thing really works, why are you posting this now when the current trial won't finish until July?***

&amp;#x200B;

Because once you hear about it in the news, it's already too late.

&amp;#x200B;

I was too slow with [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/627c8w/dd_alkon_the_falcon_a_tale_of_big_brainz_50000/), but since people misunderstood the results and ran away like a bunch of pussies I can now be early enough with a second post.  That means you now have plenty of time to pick your nose and slap your nuts while you decide if this is worth your time or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this time around there won't be any patients on Memantine to fuck up the results like they did last time.

&amp;#x200B;

***What's the deal with Memantine?***

&amp;#x200B;

To keep it simple, Memantine blocks the NMDA receptor in your brain. Don't worry about what that is. The important part is that by doing so it blocks the effects of Bryostatin.

&amp;#x200B;

To show what an impact it had on patients, here's the results that were presented in 2017 with all patients included:

[https://i.lensdump.com/i/AnbOrP.jpg](https://i.lensdump.com/i/AnbOrP.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Kinda lame, right? Well here's what those same results look like when you separate the different patient groups:

[https://i.lensdump.com/i/ABRMJD.png](https://i.lensdump.com/i/ABRMJD.png)

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't like charts, here's the raw clinical trial data (Read the part that says ""Post-hoc Outcome""):

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02431468?view=results](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02431468?view=results)

&amp;#x200B;

Look at how much the SIB scores improve once you remove patients on Memantine.

&amp;#x200B;

***Wait, what the fuck is an SIB?***

&amp;#x200B;

The SIB scale is a scale for moderate-severe AD patients that basically measures how retarded you are. The higher your score, the less retarded you are. The scale goes to 100 and once you hit max, you're no longer considered to have moderate-severe AD (I never studied neuroscience though so don't quote me on this).

Mild AD patients use the MMSE scale, but that's not relevant here since this was a trial for moderate-severe patients. The drug is however expected to work in patients with all stages of AD due to its MOA.

Here's a shitty picture that hopefully makes the scales easier to understand and compare:

[https://i.imgur.com/s61opUd.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/s61opUd.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Patients in this trial started with SIB scores around 80, and patients in the 20 dose bryo group had a mean SIB change of +6.7 after 11 weeks of treatment and 30 days of just waiting around and watching patients improve even after dosing had stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

***I don't know what the fuck you just wrote, but okay, the science seems solid. What about all these warrants though?***

&amp;#x200B;

Like with most things that sound too good to be true, this too has a catch. In this case it's the shitfuck ton of warrants.

If they're all exercised, they will bring in almost $100 million for the company, which should be more than enough to get their drug onto the market and start generating revenues, which means no more significant dilution since they don't need to raise more cash.

As of today, the fully diluted share count is at around 25 million, but let's raise it to 30 million instead because fuck you.

Even with a potential 30 million outstanding shares, this thing is still incredibly undervalued. Here's why:

[Back in July, Biogen &amp; Eisai made an announcement that they had positive results for their AD trial. Soon after, investors added $20 billion to their market caps in total.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/25/biogen-and-eisai-unveil-ban2401-alzheimers-disease-trial-results.html)

Yes, the results eventually turned out to be shit and the market cap gains disappeared soon after, but I want you to focus on how investors reacted to the positive news.

Now first of all, Biogen's drug was only expected to slow the decline of patients and not actually treat them.

Second of all, their drug was only meant to delay mild AD rather than treat brain damage in general, but hey, fuck it. Let's use $20 billion as our starting point anyways.

In that case, a successful trial would make Neurotrope worth **AT LEAST** $667 per share (20 billion divided by 30 million).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not even gonna bother looking up how many people are affected by the neurodegenerative disorders I mentioned above, but if we stick to just Alzheimer's, we can safely assume at least 10 million people will be needing this drug every year to not fucking die. There's about 50 million people around the world living with dementia today, and about 300 million are suffering from depression, but whatever, let's continue.

Let's say the drug sells for $500/month and Neurotrope gets 30% from royalties. Actually, let's drop it to 20% because go fuck yourself. That's still $100 in profits per patient each month, or $1200 per year for each patient.

Multiply $1200/year by 10 million patients and you get a company generating $12 billion in yearly profits.

Slap a P/E ratio of 15 on top of that, and you have a company worth $180 billion, or about $6000 per share.

For reference, that would give you a 150,000% profit if you bought in at $4 (Right now it's trading at $3.65).

And since this stock is so thinly traded, even a monkey fucking a banana in Cambodia can move this thing over 20% in a day.

&amp;#x200B;

***So what's your point with all this?***

GreedySpecs'DD 2/1 | don't be a hero this ain't over yet.,"I posted the following on TWTR before going to sleep 13h ago:

&gt; the theme for me this week is stagflation as we might get a  strong/inline AHE and risks are skewed to downside on ISMs given  Richmond fed. favored pos is long gold,short dxy, long jpy &amp; chf, tactical short  spooz.   
 https://twitter.com/greed\_cap/status/1080252413636952064 

Allow me to expand before delving into the options mkt.

the news last 2 weeks was the divergence between the regional fed indicators (richmond, dallas with recessionary figures among others and some of the big indicators like ISM. The question is who catches up to whom ? We will know tmrw when we get the data. in the meantime bears have food because all macro houses, sell side and buy side, use these regio fed indicators to regress the bigger ISM figure. And the recent regio fed #s suggest a below 50 ISM which is absolutely not priced in any assets outside of perhaps 30y bonds and esp not Spooz:  


https://i.redd.it/b10jflooe0821.png

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8d5s1wvqe0821.png

So watch the thursday data and if we do get below 50 # it's gonna be a bloodbath. 

that being said there is a chance dallas and richmond #s have idiosyncratic elements that will not be reflected in the main gauge and that is my base case.

\+ ISM has recently deviated to upside from model and this is likely to subsist - i think it has to do with the Cos surveyed for each. 

https://i.redd.it/264zyavcf0821.png

Still, even if you wanna fade this you gotta buy really low. 

If you had read my previous post [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ab7gel/greedyspecs\_dd\_3112\_what\_option\_mkt\_is\_saying\_and/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ab7gel/greedyspecs_dd_3112_what_option_mkt_is_saying_and/?sort=new) from last session you would hae learned that 2454.1 is a VERY strong support zone thanks to the 1billion in 250 puts that were there. indeed i bot that overnight and it's up some 50bps at this point, nothing that can't be erased in 10 min within this 30 vix/no liquidity environment but still an appreciable cushion.   


https://i.redd.it/o6otu8awf0821.png

so overall scenario is :

as long as data is inline we will be fine and probs go up going into Yellen/Bern/Pow itw. then it will become a headline play if not my twitter post at the beginning tells you everything you need to know

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ubsb5elzg0821.png

As far as the option mkt is concerned: Contrary to last few times, Salvation could come from the Qs which on a vol basis will outperform spooz today  


https://i.redd.it/najxya5kh0821.png

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/4okp1d04i0821.png

As always: We stay outside of STDVu/d range and it's safe to assume we are gonna explode in that direction due to mkt being short gamma at that level

If that happens we could be saved by the QQQ support at 148.96 / 6115.9

if not then definitely by the SPOOZ DEF2 : 2399.1

My game plan: i already have some gains as i explained and i took them pre open. post open i'm looking to get long at the QQQ support if that fails i short until the spooz one for a last try.   
Xasset nothing stands out everyone is inline
